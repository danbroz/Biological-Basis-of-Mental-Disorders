Unknown Disorder
----------------
Diagnostic Criteria
Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) is a disorder with onset
during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive
functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following three
criteria must be met:
A
.
Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning,
abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience,
confirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized
intelligence testing.
B
.
Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and
sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility.
Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more
activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and
independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work,
and community.
C
.
Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.
38
Note:
The term
intellectual developmental disorder
is used to clarify its relationship
with the WHO ICD-11 classification system, which uses the term
Disorders of
Intellectual Development
. The equivalent term
intellectual disability
is placed in
parentheses for continued use. The medical and research literature use both terms,
while intellectual disability is the term in common use by educational and other
professions, advocacy groups, and the lay public. In the United States, Public Law
111-256 (Rosa’s Law) changed all references to “mental retardation” in federal laws
to “intellectual disability.”

Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities
(i.e., spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension
or production that include the following:
1
.
Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).
2
.
Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word endings together to
form sentences based on the rules of grammar and morphology).
3
.
Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and connect sentences to
explain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation).

Speech Sound Disorder
---------------------
Diagnostic Criteria

Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)
---------------------------------------------
Diagnostic Criteria
A
.
Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that are
inappropriate for the individual’s age and language skills, persist over time, and
are characterized by frequent and marked occurrences of one (or more) of the
following:
1
.
Sound and syllable repetitions.
2
.
Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.
52
3

B
.
The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in effective
communication, social participation, or academic or occupational performance,
individually or in any combination.
C
.
The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. (
Note:
Later-onset
cases are diagnosed as F98.5 adult-onset fluency disorder.)
D
.
The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit,
dysfluency associated with neurological insult (e.g., stroke, tumor, trauma), or
another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental
disorder.

least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and
that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational
activities:

body).
B
.
The repetitive motor behavior interferes with social, academic, or other activities
and may result in self-injury.
C
.
Onset is in the early developmental period.
D
.
The repetitive motor behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or neurological condition and is not better explained by another
neurodevelopmental or mental disorder (e.g., trichotillomania [hair-pulling
disorder], obsessive-compulsive disorder).

markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.
D
.
If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief
relative to the duration of the delusional periods.
E
.
The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or
another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental
disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Specify
whether:
Erotomanic type:
This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion
is that another person is in love with the individual.

Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5
.
Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).
B
.
For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of

onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of
interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).

Schizoaffective Disorder
------------------------
Diagnostic Criteria
A
.
An uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major mood episode
(major depressive or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia.
Note:
The major depressive episode must include Criterion A1: Depressed

intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to or withdrawal from a
medication.
2
.
The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
Criterion A.
C
.
The disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder that is not
substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent psychotic
disorder could include the following:
The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after
the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other
evidence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related
episodes).
D
.
The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E
.
The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Note:
This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A
predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant
clinical attention.

Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition
---------------------------------------------------
Diagnostic Criteria
A
.
Prominent hallucinations or delusions.
B
.
There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another
medical condition.
C
.

D
.
The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E
.
The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify
whether:
Code based on predominant symptom:
F06.2 With delusions:
If delusions are the predominant symptom.
F06.0 With hallucinations:
If hallucinations are the predominant symptom.
Coding note:
Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the
mental disorder (e.g., F06.2 psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm, with
delusions). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately
immediately before the psychotic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., C34.90
malignant lung neoplasm; F06.2 psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm,
with delusions).
Specify
current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of
psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior,
and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not
present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of
Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assessment Measures.”)

Disorder
--------
Diagnostic Criteria
A
.
A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical
picture and is characterized by abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
and abnormally increased activity or energy.
B
.

the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other
evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., a history of
recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).
D
.
The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E
.
The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

immediately before the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition
(e.g., E05.90 hyperthyroidism; F06.33 bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with
manic features).

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
--------------------------------------
Diagnostic Criteria

disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., autism
spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder,
persistent depressive disorder).

is defined as a weight that is less than minimally
normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
B
.
Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that
interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.
C
.
Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced,
undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of
recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.
Coding note:
The ICD-10-CM code depends on the subtype (see below).
Specify
whether:
F50.01 Restricting type:
During the last 3 months, the individual has not
engaged in recurrent episodes of binge-eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-
induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype
describes presentations in which weight loss is accomplished primarily through
dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise.
F50.02 Binge-eating/purging type:
During the last 3 months, the individual has
engaged in recurrent episodes of binge-eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-
induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).
Specify
if:
In partial remission:
After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met,
Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met for a sustained period, but either
Criterion B (intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat or behavior that
interferes with weight gain) or Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of
weight and shape) is still met.
In full remission:
After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met,
none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.

similar period of time under similar circumstances.
2
.
A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that
one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).
B
.
Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain,
such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other
medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.
C
.
The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on
average, at least once a week for 3 months.

there has been a significant decline in cognitive function; and
2
.
A substantial impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by
standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified
clinical assessment.
B

disturbance: code first
S06.2X9S
diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of
consciousness of unspecified duration, sequela; followed by

Neurocognitive Disorder
-----------------------
Diagnostic Criteria
A
.
The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B
.
The neurocognitive impairments do not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium and persist beyond the usual duration of intoxication and acute
withdrawal.
C
.
The involved substance or medication and duration and extent of use are
capable of producing the neurocognitive impairment.
D
.
The temporal course of the neurocognitive deficits is consistent with the timing of
substance or medication use and abstinence (e.g., the deficits remain stable or
improve after a period of abstinence).
E
.
The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition or is
not better explained by another mental disorder.
Coding note (see also coding table on pp. 682–683):
The ICD-10-CM codes for
the [specific substance/medication]-induced neurocognitive disorders are indicated
in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there
is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In
any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given.
Substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder:
If a mild substance use
disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder, the
4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use
disorder” before the substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder (e.g., “mild
inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive disorder”). For
alcohol and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances, a mild substance use
disorder is insufficient to cause a substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder;
thus, there are no available ICD-10-CM codes for this combination. If a moderate or
severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced major
neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should
record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,”
depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no
comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the
clinician should record only the substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder.
713
Substance-induced mild neurocognitive disorder:
If a mild substance use
disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced mild neurocognitive disorder, the
4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use
disorder” before the substance-induced mild neurocognitive disorder (e.g., “mild

Medical Condition
-----------------
Diagnostic Criteria
A
.

B
.
There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
that the neurocognitive disorder is the pathophysiological consequence of

C
.
The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
major depressive disorder) or another specific neurocognitive disorder (e.g.,
major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease).
Coding note (see coding table on pp. 682–683):
For major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, with behavioral
disturbance, code first the other medical condition, followed by the major
neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, with behavioral
disturbance (e.g.,

Trait and personality functioning specifiers may be used to record additional
personality features that may be present in narcissistic personality disorder but are not required
for the diagnosis. For example, other traits of Antagonism (e.g., manipulativeness, deceitfulness,
callousness) are not diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (see Criterion B) but
can be specified when more pervasive antagonistic features (e.g., “malignant narcissism”) are
present. Other traits of Negative Affectivity (e.g., depressivity, anxiousness) can be specified to
record more “vulnerable” presentations. Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment
in personality functioning is required for the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder
(Criterion A), the level of personality functioning can also be specified.
