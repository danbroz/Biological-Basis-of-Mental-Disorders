      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

PMS occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolves shortly after the onset of menstruation. Diagnosis depends on exclusion of other medical and psychiatric disorders. PMS can be identified based on the presence of at least one behavioral symptom and one physical symptom during the 5 days prior to menses and relieved after the onset of menses. Laboratory testing is rarely needed but may consider on an individual basis. Treatments are used in a stepwise approach with increasing order of complexity. If non-pharmacologic treatment is unsuccessful then start with the medications with the lowest side effect profiles.",

Emotional and physical symptoms occurring along a continuum of severity are common during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a complex of mild to moderate emotional and/or physical symptoms, which typically do not interfere with patients' usual level of functioning. Up to 75% of reproductive-aged women have reported premenstrual symptoms at some time during their lives. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome, which affects 3-8% of reproductive-aged women. The hallmark of premenstrual syndrome at all levels of severity is the exclusive occurrence of symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle with remission typically within 3 days of menses onset.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE) is defined as prolonged continuous or discontinuous clusters of epileptic myoclonus, with or without impairment of consciousness. 1 MSE is a heterogeneous condition that has been described in generalized epilepsy syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases, toxic-metabolic states, and following anoxic brain injury. 2Acute symptomatic MSE usually occurs after prolonged anoxia or metabolic insults. 1 Except for acute symptomatic seizures, MSE is rarely reported in patients who do not have a history of epilepsy. 1This case study explores MSE of unknown etiology in an elderly patient who did not have a history of seizures.A 76-year-old woman presented with sudden clusters of irregular myoclonic twitching without impairment of consciousness, which had developed 1 day prior to seeking treatment.The myoclonic jerks had first appeared in the lower face and spread bilaterally to the shoulders and upper arms.They occurred with a high frequency (more than dozens of times per minute), and each cluster lasted a few seconds.The patient denied any history of seizures or morning jerks.She suffered from ischemic heart disease and had taken medications including nicorandil, aspirin, clopidogrel, and pravastatin several years previously.She did not report any other medical illness or additional medications, and denied any history of withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines.The patient was alert and oriented during her myoclonic jerks.She had experienced mild memory difficulties during the previous several years, but she reported no impairment in the activities of daily living.Laboratory findings were unremarkable, including the levels of glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and the findings of liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and arterial blood gas.Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed no acute abnormality (Fig. 1A).Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed bilateral subcortical ischemic lesions (Fig. 1B).Gradient echo imaging did not reveal any hemorrhagic lesions or microbleeds (Fig. 1C).Electroencephalogram (EEG) displayed abundant bursts of high-voltage generalized polyspikes with a normal background.In addition, generalized asymmetric spikes were observed between or preceding the bursts (Fig. 1E).Myoclonic movements were time-locked with the bursts of generalized polyspikes.The patient was initially treated intravenously with a loading dose of valproic acid (800 mg), followed by the oral administration of valproic acid (900 mg/day) beginning the next day.The myoclonic seizures almost completely resolved after single intravenous valproic acid infusion.The patient received oral valproic acid for 1 year and remained free of myoclonic seizures after valproic acid was discontinued up to the follow-up examination conducted after 3 years.This case was an elderly patient who presented with late-onset MSE without any previous history of epilepsy.Except in generalized epilepsy syndromes (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and progressive myoclonic epilepsy), MSE is usually associated with anoxic ischemic injury,",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms. This review will outline the current state of the art of a phase specific early detection and intervention based on these syndromes.",

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

      "abstract": "Masturbation, or self-stimulation of the genitalia is a common human behavior, said to occur in 90–94% of males and 50–60% of females at some time in their lives [1]. Infantile masturbation is highlighted because masturbatory behavior has been often mistaken for epilepsy due to usual presentation with paroxysmal movements of recurrent character [2]. Infantile masturbation can also mimic other conditions such as abdominal pain, paroxysmal dystonia and dyskinesia [3, 4]. Masturbatory activity in infant and young children is difficult to recognize because it has a spectrum of different behavior patterns, which often do not involve manual stimulation of the genitalia. Misdiagnosis consequently may lead to unnecessary investigations and treatment [2,3]. The condition is more often seen in girls than in boys (65% among 31 patients in Nechay at al. [5], all 12 patients were girls in Yang et al. [4]). It often starts at age under 1 year of life. Episodes are usually observed when the child is sitting in a car seat, when he/she is bored or tired and in relation to the transition between waking and sleeping [5]. During the events of masturbation children exhibit different types of behavior: dystonia-like posturing of different parts of the body has been most often seen, grunting, flushing and sweating are also very typical; rocking and assumed eidetic imagery (seeing ‘telly in the sky’) can also be observed",

We obtained a retrospective history from 24 subjects who were long term (more than 1 year) recovered from anorexia nervosa. We found that 58% reported that they had the onset of one or more childhood anxiety disorder diagnoses at the age of 10 +/- 5 years old. This was 5 years before the mean age of onset of anorexia nervosa. The onset of depression was about 1 year before the onset of anorexia nervosa in about one half the subjects. Alcohol and substance abuse/dependency tended to occur after the onset of anorexia nervosa and only occurred in anorexic subjects who binged and/or purged. The early and common onset of childhood anxiety disorders in a substantial percentage of anorexics raises the possibility that childhood anxiety disorders herald the first behavioral expression of a biologic vulnerability in some subjects who develop anorexia nervosa.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Premature ejaculation (PE) corresponds to “a persistent or recurring ejaculation pattern that occurs during sexual activity with a partner approximately 1 minute after vaginal penetration and before the person wishes to”. It affects 5–20% of men, having its origin in psychological factors and with important biological contribution. It is considered generalised, when not confined to certain patterns of stimulation, situations, or partners, or may be situational. It may occur soon after the onset of sexual activity (primary) or after a normal sexual functioning (acquired). Primary EP is associated with the hyposensitivity 5-HT2C receptors and/or hypersensitivity 5-HT1A receptors. High performance anxiety levels are related to acquired EP. Increasing this physiological knowledge has enabled significant advances in treatment. Objective Approach the therapeutic options of EP and its peculiarities. Methods Literature review of articles published in the last five years, using the PubMed and Scielo databases. Results At present, the approaches include psychosexual counseling, behavioral and pharmacotherapy. Among the most popular drugs, antidepressants stand out, particularly dapoxetine, the first medication specifically approved. Local anesthetics, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and tramadol are also used. Acupuncture is suggested as a useful therapeutic, but needs more research. Conclusion The behavioral therapies are referred to as first-line treatment in the long-term, associated or not with medication. Dapoxetine is the preferred symptomatic treatment. However, a holistic approach, including psychotherapy and sex therapy, is the most beneficial modality for sexual and marital relationship.

      "title": "Premenstrual syndrome: A modern view on the problem",
      "abstract": "Most women of reproductive age (about 80%) experience premenstrual symptoms, which indicate the approaching menstruation and are of little clinical significance, since they do not affect the quality of life. However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social, or professional live; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.Although symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from moodiness in the 18th century to premenstrual tension in the early part of 19th century to finally premenstrual in the 1950s. While some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, syndrome (PMS) includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder (LLDD), now known as dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment.Currently, PMDD is listed in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the criteria for diagnosis as follows:Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11 symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge” Marked affective lability Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased interpersonal conflicts Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work, school, friends, and hobbies) Subjective sense of difficulty in concentrating Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings Hypersomnia or insomnia A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B - symptoms severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or scholastic functioning.Criterion C - symptoms discretely related to the menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed on those of these disorders).Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation.Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life detriments, work-productivity losses, and incur greater healthcare costs than women with no or only mild symptoms.",

He describes previous occasional or short-term relationships and premature ejaculation on his first sexual experiences. During a phase without relationships, he began to discover his sexuality through masturbation, which tended to occur very frequently. He reported to especially appreciate the instant that precedes ejaculation, which led him to constantly try to delay the moment of ejaculation. Finding himself in a stable relationship, he reports that he cannot ejaculate during intercourse, achieving it only through masturbation, despite he could obtain sexual pleasure and have a sustained erection. At this point, the couple decided to have sex therapy. Premature ejaculation is a psychosexual disturbance defined as a persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it to occur. The main option for treating premature ejaculation are behavioral therapies such as the stop-start technique. In this case, the patient used this technique autonomously, by the means of masturbation, to delay his ejaculation, leading him to the point of being unable to ejaculate during intercourse.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Biologically, an MS relapse (flare, exacerbation, attack) is defined as a clinical worsening due to a new or expanding area of CNS inflammation. Clinically, the change in neurologic symptoms and signs should persist for more than 48 hours. Only two conditions have been persuasively linked to an increased risk of relapses. These are the period 2 to 6 months postpartum, when a woman’s immune system readjusts to normal,1–4 and the period 1 to 5 weeks following an infection, usually a viral infection.5,6 The reason for the latter phenomenon is not known but is believed to result from a stimulation of the immune system following its response to the infectious agent. Making the diagnosis of an MS relapse can be difficult. Many factors can contribute to a worsening of symptoms and signs in persons with MS that are not the result of new CNS inflammation. Worsening of signs and symptoms resulting from non–MS-related disease processes is called a “pseudorelapse” or “pseudo-exacerbation.” These phenomena should always be considered before diagnosing a true MS attack. Some of the most common and important non-MS causes of increased symptoms and signs are noted in Table 7.1.",

There are few reports concerning sexual problems in CES, yet they are very common in both men and women. Loss of feeling is a significant source of sexual dissatisfaction, particularly in women. The most frequent sexual disorders reported by men are reduction in orgasm and erectile dysfunction. Ejaculatory disorders are less common. Sexual problems are often accompanied by urinary symptoms.

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "title": "Management of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 35-year-old married woman with an obsessive compulsive disorder. She had a 21-year history of obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors including compulsive checking which had become persistent since the birth of her first child. There is no evidence of comorbidity, except for a mild generalized anxiety disorder. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common chronic, and disabling disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive and distressing thoughts, images, or impulses. Compulsions are repetitive, intentional behaviors that the person feels compelled to perform, often with a desire to resist. Compulsions are typically intended to avert some fear event or to reduce distress. These symptoms are ego-dystonic and cause significant distress to patients and their families. OCD is among the most common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2.3% [1]. It is almost equally distributed between males and females.OCD often begins in adolescence or early adulthood usually with a gradual onset. However, a rapid onset of symptoms may occur, sometimes associated with a traumatic event, such as pregnancy or loss. Actually, recent literature suggests that pregnancy may precipitate OCD in individuals [2, 3], as in our case report. It appears that patients who reported the onset or worsening of OCD symptoms in pregnancy developed fear of harming the fetus or child [3, 4]. However, in our case report, the patient's preoccupations deal with responsibility for her child's health (e.g. 'my son will choke to death with his blanket if I don't check'): the patient does not fear being responsible for any harm coming to her son. Due to the secretive nature of the disorder, there is often a delay of more than 10 years before patients come to specialty settings [5]. The trouble is usually long, with most patients experiencing a chronic course, while others experience a fluctuating one [6].Patients with both obsessions and compulsions constitute a large proportion of affected patients. OCD can be expressed through many different symptoms. The classical presentation includes obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors of washing and/or checking. Another pattern is one with merely intrusive obsessional thoughts, without compulsion (table 1).OCD can be severely incapacitating: depression is the most common complication and the symptoms can spread to interfere with the patient's social and occupational functioning, often involving the entire family.The case report thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or psychiatric unit. The patient meets the criteria for OCD according the DSM-IV [7].Until the early 1970s, OCD was considered a treatment refractory, chronic situation. Neither psychodynamic therapy nor a variety of pharmacological treatments, available at that time, led to significant improvement. Today, substantial evidence suggests that behavior therapy is effective in treating this chronic disorder [8]. Furthermore, recent advances in pharmacotherapy have led to a significant reduction in suffering and a return to productive living for many patients with OCD [9]. OCD is currently treated with pharmacological and/or psychological approaches. Our patient refused any pharmacological treatment; thus we recommended psychotherapy (20 sessions).Among the best established treatments are behavioral therapy, particularly those involving exposure and response prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) involves the combination of behavior therapy (BT; exposure with response prevention, ERP) and cognitive therapy (CT). After more than a quarter century of research, ERP has become the gold standard to which other psychological treatments for OCD, such as CT, have been compared [10]. For CBT15–20 sessions are proposed for the treatment of an uncomplicated OCD patient. The format is individual weekly therapy sessions. A maintenance schedule is required (monthly booster sessions for 6–12 months).BT for OCD most specifically involves exposure and response or ritual prevention. The effectiveness of BT, in the form of ERP for OCD, has been demonstrated in controlled studies and meta-analyses [11, 12]. To date, the last meta-analysis [12]including 77 studies with 4,651 patients showed that BT was superior to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Exposure capitalizes on the fact that anxiety usually attenuates after a sufficient duration of contact with a feared stimulus. In order to achieve adequate exposure, it is usually necessary to help the patient block the rituals or avoidance behaviors, a process termed response or ritual prevention. In fact, the OCD patient is exposed to stimuli that provoke the obsessive response and helped to desist from avoidance and escape (compulsive) behavior. The rationale for treatment has to be outlined in the detail during the initial session for the patient and significant others, if present. This rationale uses a functional analysis to describe the patient's symptoms and to explain how the reduction of anxiety through compulsions maintains the behavior. It includes the theoretical and practical implications of ERP, focusing on the reduction of anxiety and rituals, and explains imaginary and in vivo exposure. Information gathering includes current OCD symptoms and general functioning, administration of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, course and history of OCD, previous treatment and response, general psychosocial and family history. Information gathering usually requires three sessions. Treatment planning has to be completed in the session preceding the first exposure session, focusing on the construction of a hierarchy (which includes items that the patient either currently avoids or performs only with rituals). The patient is asked to rate each item on a rating scale in which 0 indicates no anxiety and 100 indicates maximum anxiety. After the situations are ranked from lowest to highest anxiety rating, exposure therapy proceeds upward on the hierarchy, beginning with the lower-rated items to maximize compliance of the patient. The techniques which have to be used are therapist-aided ERP in imagination and/or in vivo, exposure in vivo with response prevention through homework and family intervention whenever the family is involved in rituals [13, 14]. The patients have to record homework completion. Behavioral homework is discussed and set with the therapist.To date less attention has been paid to CT, which may be added to ERP, to address such things as faulty estimation of danger or the exaggerated sense of personal responsibility often seen in OCD patients. The first step in CT for OCD consists of informing the patient that his/her intrusive thoughts are an abnormal phenomenon and provides him or her with a list of intrusive thoughts that commonly occur in the general population [15]. The patient learns that the difference between normal and dysfunctional intrusive thoughts lies in the significance attached to these thoughts. The interpretation of these intrusive thoughts made by people with obsession affects the occurrence and/or the content of these thoughts [16]. An important general cognitive technique used by the therapist to challenge the automatic thoughts is Socratic Dialogue [17]. The patient is encouraged to question the catastrophic significance of the intrusive thought and to construct alternative less catastrophic interpretations. Behavioral experiments are also commonly used to test the empirical basis of the patient's new interpretation in order to challenge or evaluate the beliefs. Two controlled trials compared CT based on Beck's model and ERP. Van Oppen et al. [10]demonstrated that CT was better than ERP at the post-test phase, but to date no follow-up of this study has been published. In a randomized controlled trial [18]CT and intensive BT were equally effective on OCD, but at post-test CT had specific effects on depression which were stronger than those of BT. Findings for the 1-year follow-up study are presently in preparation. The principal finding is that benefits are maintained and both treatments produced equivalent results: at week 26 and 52, improvement was retained in both groups without between-group difference. Cognitive measures of obsessions changed equally in the 2 groups.In our case, the first 3 sessions were assigned to the behavioral analysis, the therapeutic goals, and evaluation. We then started the CT from session 3 to 12. We first explained the OCD cognitive model to the patient, and then we taught her to point out and modify her automatic thoughts and cognitive biases. Automatic thoughts dealt with disasters and her responsibility for these ('if I haven't closed the window, someone will enter and take my son away'). During the 13th session, we started the behavioral therapy (ERP) for 8 sessions. After having explained the OCD behavioral model and the habituation principle to the patient, we set up a hierarchy in order to expose the patient (imaginary and in vivo exposure).The predominant hypothesis about OCD pathophysiology implicates abnormal serotonergic function regulation. Research clearly shows that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only effective treatments for OCD. These medications increase the concentration of serotonin. Six SRIs are currently available: clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram are SSRIs because they primarily affect only serotonin. Clomipramine is a nonselective SRI: it affects many other neurotransmitters besides serotonin.In most cases, treatment should be initiated with a SSRI because of the superior safety tolerability, and equivalent efficacy of this class of drug compared with clomipramine [19]. Actually, there have been relatively few comparative studies between the SSRIs in the treatment of OCD [20, 21, 22]. The studies comparing SSRI and clomipramine have shown that they all demonstrated efficacy [23, 24]. However, clomipramine is also associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In a flexible dose trial of paroxetine compared with clomipramine in 406 patients with OCD [26], paroxetine and clomipramine were more effective than placebo. In terms of efficacy, no significant difference between paroxetine and clomipramine were noted beginning at week 6, and the response was nearly equivalent at week 12. However, significantly more patients treated with clomipramine withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. In a review of the efficacy of SRIs in OCD [30], the authors reported that SSRIs possess efficacy similar to that of clomipramine, but have a superior side effect profile. This suggestion may have important implications for patients with OCD who require long-term treatment. In a multicenter meta-analysis [31]placebo-controlled trials found clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline to be superior to placebo. These authors also found that the 3 SSRIs were comparable to each other in efficacy and that clomipramine was more effective than the SSRIs. Stein et al. [32]presented a meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy trials for OCD. In placebo-controlled trials, SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) had a significant effect on medication effect size with clomipramine more effective than fluoxetine. Another meta- analytic review of the efficacy of drug treatments [33]found that SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) are effective in short-term treatments for patients suffering from OCD; although the increase in improvement rate over placebo was greater for clomipramine than for SSRIs, direct comparison between these drugs showed that they had similar therapeutic efficacy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms; concomitant high levels of depression at the outset did not seem necessary for clomipramine and for SSRIs to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In a meta-analysis comparing pharmacological treatments of OCD (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) [34], clomipramine was not significantly better than fluoxetine or fluvoxamine; no significant difference was found between clomipramine and the other SRIs as a group in head to head trials; furthermore, no difference in drop-out rates was found. Clomipramine stands out from the other SRIs. The authors conclude that this difference is probably not clinically significant enough to warrant first choice treatment, given clomipramine's greater lethality in overdose.The backbone of pharmacological treatment for OCD is a 10- to 12- week trial with clomipramine or a SSRI in adequate doses before initiating alternative therapy. Actually, OCD appears to respond in a time interval of approximately 8–12 weeks. Clinical experience suggests the necessity of long-term, and in some case lifelong treatment. As far as pharmacologic treatment is concerned, a drug treatment should last at least 2 years after the remission of symptoms before considering medication withdrawal. This is motivated by the fact that preliminary evidence suggests that relapses after discontinuation of the drug are associated with increased resistance of treatment [35]. If the patient does not respond to an average dose of SSRI, the experts [36]recommend gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 4–8 weeks from the start of the treatment. When a patient is having a partial response to an average dose of SSRI, the experts suggest gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 5–9 weeks from the start of the treatment. They consider 8–13 weeks an adequate medication trial before changing medication or augmenting with another agent.Despite these significant advances in pharmacological treatment with SSRIs and clomipramine, as many as 40–60% of OCD patients are clinically unchanged after an adequate trial with these agents [37].Simos [38]reported that the efficacy of combined BT and pharmacotherapy for OCD is controversial. In a review of relevant studies, Steketee [39]concluded that this combination has shown little advantage over BT alone. Preliminary findings from a trial by Kozak et al. [40]also supported this conclusion. However, some controlled studies combining BT with antidepressants showed a better outcome on rituals and depression in the long term. In particular, Cottraux et al. [41]showed that SSRI + BT compared to placebo + BT gives better results at 3 months on rituals and at 6 months on depression with equivalent results at 12 and 18 months. Moreover, a more recent but small sample study comparing CBT and medication in the treatment of OCD provided evidence in favor of the combination [42]. OCD patients received 1 of 4 treatments: medication and CBT simultaneously; CBT only; medication while on a waiting list for CBT, or no treatment while on a waiting list for CBT. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and clinical ratings significantly improved after treatment in all groups except the non-treatment, waiting list, control group. Subjects in the 2 treatment groups receiving CBT showed reduced strength in their obsessional beliefs. The subsequent administration of CBT to those groups on the waiting list also decreased the strength of their primary obsessional beliefs and beliefs about the consequences of not performing the rituals. Results of this small sample study suggest that either CBT or medication alone is more effective than no treatment. The combination seems to potentiate treatment efficacy, and, according to the authors, it is more clinically beneficial to introduce CBT after a period of medication rather than to start both therapies simultaneously. This study is limited by the small number of subjects per condition (5–9 maximum), the duration of the treatment (5 months), and the absence of follow-up.Initial management of OCD relies on potent SRIs and CBT, used separately, sequentially or concurrently. 90% of patients can be helped with one or combination of these therapies [43].Unfortunately some patients do not respond adequately or at all to the initial treatment plan of CBT or SSRI or a combination of the two. The experts [36]recommend adding an SSRI when patients have not responded well to CBT alone. When patients have not done well with medication management alone, the experts suggest either adding CBT or switching to another SSRI. Thus, combined CBT and medication is the experts' preference for most patients who have not responded to an initial trial of either CBT or medication alone. In patients who have shown no response to combined treatment, the experts recommend switching SSRIs and continuing CBT. In patients with a partial response to combination therapy, they suggest switching SSRIs, providing more CBT, and possibly augmenting with another medication.Some patients are treatment-refractory, defined by the experts [36]as those who fail to respond to 3 sequential well-delivered SRI trials combined with expert CBT. A thorough clinical assessment of patients with treatment-refractory OCD is the first step in planning possible intervention. All DSM-IV axes should be thoroughly evaluated. These aspects include assessment of complications: Axis I (e.g., comorbid disorders); Axis II (e.g., personality disorders); Axis III (e.g., underlying medical disorder), and Axis IV (e.g., psychosocial stressors). In addition, the OCD symptoms themselves should be carefully assessed. Actually, there is some evidence that hoarding is more likely than other OCD symptoms to fail to respond to treatment [44, 45].There are a growing number of management options, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy augmentation, and alternative interventions for treatment-refractory OCD patients. The literature has somewhat less agreement about what to do in managing treatment-refractory patients. First-line recommendations are to add an augmenting medication, especially if the patient exhibits associated features (e.g., tics or a comorbid anxiety disorder) that might predict a positive response to augmentation. For example, it may be helpful to add an anxiety-reducing medication, such as clonazepam or alprazolam, in patients with high levels of anxiety; a high potency neuroleptic, such as haloperidol or risperidone, when tics or comorbid schizotypy are present. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting (e.g., using a partial hospital or inpatient behavioral unit to conduct therapist-assisted ERP), technique, intensity (additional CBT sessions or intensive CBT), or format (family or group therapy), or to switch to another SRI or a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Pharmacotherapy augmentation included augmentation with serotoningeric agents, dopaminergic agents, and various other agents as well as alternative forms (e.g., increased doses) or routes (e.g., intravenous administration) of SRI administration.There are a variety of psychological factors, such as low motivation, negative expectancies for treatment success, procrastination, and noncompliance, that may interfere with response to ERP. In these cases, the cognitive component of OCD should be addressed more directly [46]. Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions were studied as predictors of compliance with and response to BT in a controlled trial [47]. High scores on the hoarding dimension were more likely to dropout prematurely from the study and tend to improve less. BT is specially indicated for OCD patients with aggressive/checking, contamination/cleaning and symmetry/ordering symptoms. OCD patients with comorbid personality disorder should be treated by integrative CT [48].To better understand the causes of obsessions and compulsions, further work needs to be done to identify cognitive domains (beliefs and appraisals) that are specific to OCD. Some of the beliefs and appraisals identified by the Obsessive Compulsive Working Group [49]may be nonspecific, playing a role in obsessions, compulsions, and in many other clinical problems such as depression and generalized anxiety. Further work also needs to be done to identify the causes of important beliefs and appraisals. Advances in understanding OCD are more likely to occur if we can integrate the various methods of assessment [50]. There are also several challenges to be met in the area of OC spectrum disorders. First, the boundaries of the OC spectrum need to be better defined. More systematic research is needed on the relationship between OCD and various spectrum disorders, especially with respect to etiology, treatment response, and other theoretical important features [51]. Notwithstanding the growing evidence for the efficacy of CT or CBT in treating OCD, there is still little evidence that cognitive components of treatment add to the effectiveness of behavioral therapy [18, 52]. Perhaps we do not yet know enough about cognition in OCD, especially how to measure and modify them. A number of researchers have demonstrated that CBT produces a change in measures of beliefs considered relevant and/or specific to OCD. However, these studies are preliminary at this point, but nonetheless promising [53].The development of new models of OCD should help to understand and improve actual treatments, such as the model of perceived impulsivity and compensatory compulsivity [54].The experts [36]usually prefer to begin the treatment of OCD with either CBT alone or with a combination of CBT and medication. The likelihood that medication will be included in the recommendation varies with the severity of the OCD and the age of the patient. In milder OCD, CBT alone is the initial choice. As severity increased, the experts are more likely to add medications to CBT as the initial treatment or to use medication alone. In younger patients, the experts are more likely to use CBT alone. The experts consider the combination of ERP as the optimal behavioral psychotherapy for OCD, while CT may provide additional benefit by directly targeting distorted 'OCD beliefs' and/or by improving compliance with ERP.In managing treatment-refractory patients, the experts suggest a variety of augmentation strategies that can be tried in OCD, including clomipramine, clonazepam, conventional neuroleptics, buspirone, risperidone, and a second SSRI added to the first. The choice of augmentation medications would have to be tailor made for each patient. Clomipramine may be useful in boosting the response of a patient treated with an SSRI who is not having an adequate response. Neuroleptics may be helpful for patients who have not had an adequate response to an SRI and who have a comorbid tic disorder, OCD symptoms such as compulsive touching that resembles tics, or a comorbid schizotypy. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting, technique, or intensity, or to switch to another SRI or an MAOI. Finally, in patients with extremely severe and non-remitting OCD, intravenous clomipramine, neurosurgery, or electro-convulsive therapy (if the patient is also depressed) may sometimes be considered.The case illustrated in here represents a typical obsessive compulsive patient. We offered her a CBT effective in 20 sessions. The Yates-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score dropped from 29 at the beginning of therapy to 13 at the end of the treatment. This decrease represents a 55% efficacy. Results were stable for the 1-year follow-up. The overall strategies for treatment of OCD are presented in figure 1. On the basis of the evidence available, the following approach is outlined.The first step in treating OCD is educating the patient and family about OCD and its treatment as a medical illness. During the last 20 years, two effective treatments have been developed: CBT and medication with a SSRI. Education is crucial in helping the patients and their families learn how to best manage OCD and prevent complications. CBT is the key element of treatment for most patients with OCD. Medication with SSRI is helpful for many patients, especially for patients with depression. The BT (ERP) involved systematic exposure to the obsessions as well as prevention of any compulsive or neutralizing behaviors that might be used to reduce anxiety. ERP did prove to be a very successful form of treatment for OCD, especially for those with washing and, to a lesser extent, checking rituals. Outcome studies of ERP indicate that approximated 70–80% of OCD patients who complete treatment show significant symptom improvement [55]. CT, which may be added to BT, addresses such dysfunctional beliefs as faulty estimation of the importance of thoughts, exaggerated sense of personal responsibility and perfectionism often seen in OCD patients. CT may also provide additional benefits by improving compliance with ERP. CT may also be of value for the substantial number of refusers and potential drop-outs of BT. Because of well-proven efficacy and safety profiles, the SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of patients with OCD. Patients who initially do not respond to SSRI therapy may benefit from switching to another SSRI or combining another medication or CBT with SSRI. There is evidence that addition of a neuroleptic may improve response to SSRI in some patients.Once OCD symptoms are eliminated or much reduced – a goal which is practical for the majority of those with OCD – then maintenance of treatment gains becomes the goal. When patients have completed a successful course of treatment for OCD, most experts recommend monthly follow-up visits for at least 6 months and continued treatment for at least 2 years before trying to stop medication or CBT. Relapse is very common when medication is withdrawn, particularly if the person has not felt the benefit of CBT. Therefore, many experts recommend continuing medication if the patients do not have access to CBT. Individuals with repeated episodes of OCD may need to receive long-term or even life-long prophylactic medication. The experts recommend such long-term treatment after 2–4 severe relapses or 3–4 milder relapses.The efficacy, acceptance and cost-effectiveness of short-term interventions for patients with OCD should certainly be further improved. The identification of factors which predict treatment response is a major goal. To effectively address the needs of individuals with severe and refractory OCD, current treatment strategies may need to be modified and supplemented. A promising area of research is the role of cognitive factors in OCD. Only the reports by Sookman and Pinard [48]have specifically examined the use of cognitive intervention with a difficult-to-treat sample of OCD patients. The apparent success of their cognitive treatment suggests that cognitive mechanisms could be involved in determining the severity or resilience of OCD. However, firm conclusions regarding the specific effects on cognitive intervention on severe or refractory OCD must await controlled studies.The authors wish to thank Emilie Aurouer for the English translation.'Case management' is a section which addresses biopsychosocial management of cases in clinical medicine.

      "abstract": "Cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle is an uncommon disorder, not included under the accepted definitions of functional psychoses. We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

      "title": "854 Sexsomnia in a Divorce Proceeding and its Custody Implications",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

In fact no immediate dramatic cause has yet been demonstrated that would account for such mental breakdowns, and it would be surprising if it had, for the great majority of psychoses not related to maternity show no simple sequence of cause and effect. Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

      "title": "Persistent Delusional Disorder Presenting as Munchausen by Proxy - A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Delusion is a false, unshakable belief that is out of keeping with the patient’s social and cultural background (Patricia Casey et al, 2019). Persistent delusional disorder (PDD) is characterized by the development either of a single delusion or of a set of related delusions which are usually persistent and sometimes lifelong. Often they are persecutory, hypochondriacal, or grandiose, but they may be concerned with litigation or jealously, or express a conviction that the individual’s body is misshapen, or that others think that he or she smells or is homosexual (ICD-10 classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders). Delusional disorder with delusions of infidelity has been called conjugal paranoia or Othello syndrome (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2015). Munchausen syndrome was first termed by Asher in 1951. Munchausen syndrome by proxy, essentially, is a form of child abuse in which a parent, usually the mother, or a caregiver repeatedly fabricates or actually inflicts injury or illness in a child for whom medical intervention is then sought, often in an emergency setting (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2015). This case report presents one such beautiful case, where a father with persistent delusional disorder repeatedly fabricates an illness in his daughter, and make multiple requests to medicate his daughter. The core component of the delusional belief was infidelity. Initially, it was difficult to find any psychopathology in the daughter, except for some maladaptive reaction formation to frequent altercations with the father. Subsequently, it was realized that the father had persistent delusional belief related to his daughter’s fidelity (which was not corroborated by the daughter or other relatives). Personality can play a role in the genesis of delusional states; abnormally suspicious personalities can react to difficulties with deepening ideas of persecution, or may slowly develop delusions of marital infidelity or bodily ill health. One basic difference between Schizophrenia and PDD, is that delusions in PDD are well systematized, with one basic delusion and remainder of the system being logically built on this error (Patricia Casey et al, 2019). Persistent delusional disorders lack other psychopathology like hallucinations seen in Schizophrenia. Keywords: Persistent Delusional Disorder, Munchausen by Proxy, Infidelity, Paranoia",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

But after experimental deprivations of sleep the audiogenic paroxysmal seizures run only as initial motor excitement without obvious convulsions. Such sort of seizures promote a faster beginning of recovery process after deprivations and did not cause any disorganization of the function of the brain systems responsible for starting and shaping (maintenance) fast-wave sleep.",

In recent years the subject of When, and even How is raised with increasing frequency, and the patient expects the physician to reply with appropriate answers. The reply must be tempered by the level of the patient's recovery, the evaluation of what other activities the patient can perform without pain or with minimal pain and the method to be used. Sexual activity may precipitate recurrent pain or aggravate existing pain in the same manner as lifting, pushing, pulling or any other physical activity, if performed too early or too vigorously in the course of recovery from neck, back or radicular pain syndromes. In dealing with the problem of recovery from painful musculoskeletal or neuromuscular states, timing is of the utmost importance. Unless a timetable is specifically outlined, recurrences are common, and the condition may become chronic. The inability of the patient to deal satisfactorily with the sexual aspect of his daily living may, in itself, lead to emotional tensions and guilt feelings which may delay or prevent recovery. There is need to handle this problem at every level of the involvement in order to achieve a desirable end result-namely, the absence of pain and its replacement with pleasure.",

      "abstract": "This article describes a phenomenon, persistent sexual arousal syndrome (PSAS), which heretofore has not been noted or described in the sexuality, psychiatric or medical literature. The syndrome is precisely the opposite of female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), in that the woman's complaint is of excessive and often unremitting arousal rather than of deficient or absent arousal. Five case descriptions are reported, highlighting the essential feature of the syndrome−persistent physiological arousal in the absence of conscious feelings of sexual desire. To date, no obvious hormonal, vascular, neurological, or psychological causes have been identified as underlying the symptoms of any of these patients. The cases are presented in the hope that they will stimulate efforts to investigate the prevalence, etiology, course, and management of PSAS.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: How to Alleviate Her Suffering; Accurate Diagnosis, Tailored Treatments Can Greatly Improve Women's Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Approximately 75% of women experience a premenstrual change in emotional or physical symptoms commonly referred to as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These symptoms--including increased irritability, tension, depressed mood, and somatic complaints such as breast tenderness and bloating--often are mild to moderate and cause minimal distress. (1) However, approximately 3% to 9% of women experience moderate to severe premenstrual mood symptoms that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] PMDD includes depressed or labile mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that occur exclusively during the 2 weeks before menses and cause significant deterioration in daily functioning. Women with PMDD use general and mental health services more often than women without the condition. (3) They may experience impairment in marital and parental relationships as severe as that experienced by women with recurrent or chronic major depression. (2) PMDD often responds to treatment. Unfortunately, many women with PMDD do not seek treatment, and to 90% may go undiagnosed.4 In this article, we review the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDD. A complex disorder A distinguishing characteristic of PMDD is the timing of symptom onset. In women with PMDD, mood symptoms occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (ovulation until onset of menses) and resolve after menstruation onset. Women with PMDD report normal mood and functioning during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (first day of the menstrual cycle until ovulation). Although PMS and PMDD criteria share affective and somatic symptoms, more symptoms are required for a PMDD diagnosis, and symptoms often are more severe. (5) As defined in DSM-IV-TR (Table), (6) PMDD has a broader range of symptoms than PMS and includes symptoms not included in the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria for PMS, (7) such as impaired concentration, appetite, and sleep (hypersomnia or insomnia); and mood lability. PMDD symptoms must occur only during the 2 weeks preceding menses, although average symptoms last 6 days and severity usually peaks in the 2 days before menses. (1) The prevalence of subthreshold PMDD is fairly common; approximately 19% of women will meet some--but not all--DSM-IV-TR criteria for PMDD. (3) In a revision proposed for DSM-5, PMDD would be included as a mood disorder, which represents a significant change from DSM-IV-TR, where it is listed in the appendix as criteria. (8) In addition, in oral contraceptive users, a PMDD diagnosis should not be made unless the premenstrual symptoms are reported to be present and as severe when the woman is not taking the oral contraceptive. (8) DSM-IV-TR research criteria for PMDD A. In most menstrual cycles of the past year, [greater than or equal to] 5 of the following symptoms must be present for most of the time during the last week of the luteal phase, begin to remit within a few days after the onset of the follicular phase, and are absent in the week postmenses, with [greater than or equal to] 1 of the symptoms being either 1, 2, 3, or 4: 1. Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopeless, or self-deprecating thoughts 2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being keyed up or on edge 3. Marked affectivity lability 4.

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

The dysfunction is characterized by an excitement that persists for prolonged periods, such as hours, days or weeks. The excitement is not linked to sexual desire and may also be triggered by non sexual stimuli, as mere vibrations; moreover it cannot find a way out in an orgasm, which often proves unsatisfactory. Causes that may contribute to increase female sexual activity, be it egosyntonic or egodistonic, pleasant or disturbing for the couple, are still not appropriately investigated (Leiblum, Graziottin, 2007).",

The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

      "title": "Značaj Empty selle u procjeni funkcije hipofize",
      "abstract": "The term sella (ESS) indicates the presence of an enlarged Sella turcica which contains a remodeled pituitary gland by pressing it against the back and lower wall of the sellar space. The condition is the result of the expansion of the subarachnoid space in the sella as a result of the incomplete continuity of the sellar diaphragm. There are two types of empty sella syndrome (ESS) with a difference in repercussions on the endocrine system. Therefore, with regard to etiology, empty Sella syndrome may be primary, if there is no pathological process in the selar region itself which is the cause of damage to the pituitary gland, or secondary, if it was caused by a specific pathological process. Primary empty sella syndrome (PESS) may be an incidental finding or can be registered with imaging methods of examination of patients presented with endocrine disorders, neurological symptoms, visual disturbances, etc. It may be caused by intracranial hypertension and/or selar diaphragm insufficiency in patients who have not previously documented any pathology of the pituitary gland. Secondary empty sella syndrome (SESS) is much more frequent and associated with various pathological conditions and processes of the selar region. The presence of intrasellar masses changes the normal anatomy of the diaphragm, stretching, enlarging and thining it, and increases the chances of developing arachnoid adhesions that can withdraw the SVS to the sellar cavity. Radiotherapy, surgery, medication therapy, infections, post-partum pituitary necrosis, trauma and spontaneous resolution may induce a reduction in the sellar mass and stimulate the emergence of secondary empty sella syndrome associated with the development of scar tissue tissues, which after a few months of retraction can pull the supraselar structures causing visual deficits. The disease is treated appropriately to the disorder-medical therapy of endocrine disorders, surgical excision of intrasellar masses and adhesions and reduction of intracranial pressure.",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente.

Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc.

En el caso de la depresión, la última clasificación de la Asociación Americana de Psiquiatría (DSM-5) (2013) sustituyó el especificador “de comienzo en el posparto” por “con inicio en el periparto” porque muchas depresiones posparto comienzan en el embarazo. Empero, la denominación posparto sigue siendo válida, y debe conservarse con independencia de si su inicio fue en el posparto (hasta seis meses después del parto) o en el embarazo. Los síntomas depresivos puerperales pueden encontrarse en la disforia, la DPP (monopolar o bipolar) o la psicosis afectiva puerperal. La DPP y la psicosis comprometen el funcionamiento materno y se asocian a alteraciones del vínculo madre/hijo(a). El tratamiento oportuno y la prevención de estos trastornos minimizan los riesgos y favorecen la salud de la madre y su descendencia. The puerperium is a period of increased psychic vulnerability and postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common obstetric complication. In the last classification of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5) (2013), the specifier “with postpartum onset” was replaced by the specificer “with peripartum onset” to acknowledge the fact that many PPDs start during pregnancy. However, the postpartum denomination remains a valid one and should be kept regardless the depression started in pregnancy or up to six months postpartum. Puerperal depressive symptoms may be found in the postpartum blues, unipolar or bipolar PPD or puerperal affective psychosis. PPD and psychosis cause impairment of maternal functioning and affect the mother-infant relationship. Timely treatment and prevention of these disorders minimize risks and favour the health of the mother and that of the offspring.",

      "title": "RECURRENT CONVULSIVE SEIZURES IN ANIMALS PRODUCED IMMUNOLOGIC AND CHEMICAL MEANS",
      "abstract": "Acute, intermittent and recurrent convulsive seizures have been induced in monkeys by the application of discs containing various immunologically and chemically active substances to the cerebral cortex overlying the motor area. Acute seizures were either single attacks, or a series which usually terminated within one week of onset. Intermittent seizures occurred at widely-spaced intervals over a period of weeks or months. Recurrent seizures were frequent in occurrence (often daily) and persisted for many months. The seizures induced were either typically Jacksonian in nature, or generalized, and usually lasted one-half to two minutes. During unilateral seizures the attack was confined to the muscle groups on the side of the body contralateral to the treated cerebral hemisphere. Seizures occurred either spontaneously, or were induced by external stimuli. Egg-white placed on the brain of monkeys generally sensitized to egg-white, or egg-white injected intravenously into animals in which egg-white had previously been applied to the cortex, yielded acute seizures. Egg-white, egg-white followed by anti-egg-white rabbit serum, specific antigen-antibody precipitates, and typhoid vaccine proved to be effective agents in the production of intermittent seizures. Hydrous oxides of aluminum, alone or in combination with various proteins, invariably produced convulsive seizures, often recurring for many months (in one instance for more than one year to date). These recurrent seizures were of special interest since they represented a state of chronic convulsive reactivity. Control preparations of aquaphor, alone or in combination with rabbit serum, monkey serum or gelatin, or empty discs failed to induce seizures. Electric shock revealed a lowered threshold of convulsive reactivity of one motor area as compared with the other in monkeys exhibiting either unilateral or predominantly unilateral seizures. Electroencephalography indicated that the greatest degree of abnormality in monkeys with convulsive seizures was observed in the precentral cortex and the immediately surrounding area. The recordings also established differences between the two motor areas which were correlated with differences in the clinical manifestations observed on the opposite sides of the body. Luminal and dilantin were found to reduce the incidence of the recurrent seizures produced. Serologic studies revealed no correlation between the concentration of serum precipitins or agglutinins and the occurrence of seizures. Brain antibodies were not demonstrable. The histopathologic findings were of two main types: (1) an acute, destructive process; (2) a chronic, proliferative type of response. The acute lesion was usually associated with the acute or intermittent convulsive seizures produced by immunologic agents. The chronic pathologic response was found in monkeys treated with alumina, aquaphor preparations or empty discs, and was not pathognomonic of the convulsive state. Repeated convulsive seizures have been produced by a single application of various types of substances to the cerebral cortex. Although the mechanism remains obscure, the methods employed may prove useful in further studies of the nature of the convulsive state.",

The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "title": "Geriatric Seizures",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Seizures have been defined as an intermittent derangement of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. The discharge results in an almost instantaneous disturbance of sensation, convulsive movements, altered or impaired cognition, or some combination thereof.1 Although seizures originating in patients aged 65 and older were once considered to be rare, they are remarkably frequent, with an incidence rate higher than 100 in 100,000. On an age-specific basis, other than the neonatal period, the highest incidence of new onset seizures occurs in the population aged 65 and older.2 Clinically, geriatric seizures are not different from those of children, adolescents, and younger adults, except for petit mal siezures, which almost never originate in older persons.3 Moreover, onset of seizures after aged 65 years and older is more often symptomatic and associated with injury than in younger individuals.4 The incidence of late-onset seizure progressively increases with each decade beyond age 60 (see Table 1).5 The etiology of this occurrence depends to a large extent on age and “cognitive integrity.”6 The most common etiologies of geriatric seizures include, with ranges of frequency, cerebrovascular disease (11%–54%), undetermined, (13%–43.5%), brain neoplasm (2.1%–33%), multifactorial etiology (6%–20%), head trauma (4.3%–21%), Alzheimers disease (9.1%–17%), metabolic disorders (6.5%–10%), and central nervous system infection (2%–4%).7-9 Seizures are the third-most-common neurological disorder in older persons, with cerebrovascular accidents being the most-common precipitant for a seizure after the age of 60. Neurodegenerative diseases are now accepted as a not-infrequent cause of seizures in older people,3 and advanced Alzheimer's disease is associated with a sixfold increased risk of unprovoked seizure, after controlling for age and gender.10 Older persons and dementia populations differ as to proportion and type of neurotransmitter declines but both are overrepresented in epilepsy epidemiology. Neuronal conduction abnormalities in the aging brain, whether associated with changes in the amount or activity of specific neurotransmitters or with reduced sensitivity to them, is thought to be associated with some of the more-prevalent emotional, behavioral, and neurological disorders of older persons. The relationship between central nervous system function and individual neurotransmitters remains only partially recognized. Less well appreciated is the interdependency of major neurotransmitter systems. Understanding of the intra- and interdependent roles within the central neurointegrative network may provide new insights into disorders of cognition in older people. As researchers gain more appreciation of the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation, we may be able to develop therapeutic agents designed to suppress seizure-provoking mechanisms and to enhance the brain's natural protective mechanisms.11",

The muscle jerks are not associated with arousals or awakenings. Prevalence is unknown but is believed to be rare. There is no difference between genders. It has a self-limited course, with resolution by 6 months of age in most infants. No specific therapy is necessary. Pathogenesis has been postulated to involve a possible developmental abnormality of the reticular activating system. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring during polysomnography demonstrate muscle activity with a frequency of four to five jerks per second, occurring in clusters lasting 3 to 15 minutes. It is generally observed during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but can sometimes occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No seizure activity is present on EEG tracings.",

      "title": "SGCE Myoclonus-Dystonia",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SGCE myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE-M-D) is a movement disorder characterized by a combination of rapid, brief muscle contractions (myoclonus) and/or sustained twisting and repetitive movements that result in abnormal postures (dystonia). The myoclonic jerks typical of SGCE-M-D most often affect the neck, trunk, and upper limbs with less common involvement of the legs. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have additional focal or segmental dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp. Non-motor features may include alcohol abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Symptom onset is usually in the first decade of life and almost always by age 20 years, but ranges from age six months to 80 years. Most affected adults report a dramatic reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. SGCE-M-D is compatible with an active life of normal span. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SGCE-M-D is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SGCE. Management Treatment of manifestations: Class 1 evidence supports the improvement of myoclonus and dystonia with zonisamide. Benzodiazepines (particularly clonazepam) and anti-seizure drugs used to treat myoclonus (especially valproate and levitiracetam) also improve myoclonus in individuals with myoclonus-dystonia. The response to other anti-seizure drugs (e.g., topiramate) is more variable. Anticholinergic medication may improve dystonia. Botulinum toxin injection may be especially helpful for cervical dystonia. Improvement with L-5-hydroxytryptophan, L-dopa, and the salt of sodium oxybate has been reported. Deep brain stimulation has improved both myoclonus and dystonia, with most targeting the globus pallidus interna (GPi); however, success with ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) target has also been reported. Other: Symptoms of SGCE-M-D often improve short term with ingestion of alcohol, but the risk of addiction recommends against its long-term use. Genetic counseling SGCE-M-D is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with penetrance determined by the parental origin of the altered SGCE allele: an SGCE pathogenic variant on the paternally derived (expressed) SGCE allele generally results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived (silenced) SGCE allele typically does not result in disease. Most individuals with SGCE-M-D inherited the disorder from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have clinical signs of M-D (as phenotypic expression in the parent would depend on the sex of the transmitting grandparent). Each child of an individual with SGCE-M-D has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Almost all children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their father develop symptoms, whereas only ~5% of children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their mother develop symptoms. Once the SGCE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "title": "Pharmacological treatment of poststroke pathological laughing and crying",
      "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with left-sided limb weakness after a stroke was referred for assessment and treatment of depression. The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication.\r\n\r\nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke.\r\n\r\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs.\r\n\r\nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.",

      "abstract": "BREATH-HOLDING spells are defined as a temporary interruption of respiration at the end of the expiratory phase, leading to mild cyanosis, unconsciousness, or convulsive seizures of either a tonic or clonic nature. In their developmental sequence there is at first crying, then a long, sustained expiratory cry without a succeeding inspiration; cyanosis replaces the previous flushing of the face (although sometimes pallor is more marked than cyanosis); then there is a stiffening of the limbs, usually in extension, followed by loss of consciousness, relaxation, inspiration, and, in a short time, recovery. In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both. The spells are said to be an early infantile form of temper tantrum—a primitive expression of anger or frustration. Such being the case,",

      "title": "Premenstruális szindróma és premenstruális dysphoriás zavar.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak a mindennapi életben, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS és a premenstruációs dysphoriás zavar (PMDD) diagnózisa a következő kritériumok alapján állítható fel a Premenstruális Rendellenességek Nemzetközi Társaságának (International Society for Premenstrual Disorders – ISPMD) ajánlása szerint: a PMS esetében a nőnek 1–4 tünete van, amelyek lehetnek fizikai, viselkedési vagy affektív/pszichológiai jellegűek, vagy minimum 5 tünettel rendelkezik, melyek fizikai vagy viselkedési jellegűek. Ha viszont egy nőnek 5 vagy több tünete van, és ezek közül az egyik affektív tünet (például ingerlékenység, hangulatingadozás, düh) a fizikai vagy viselkedési tünetek mellett, akkor a pontosabb PMDD diagnózisa állítható fel. A diagnózisok megerősítéséhez az általános és a nőgyógyászati anamnézis mellett a páciens által naponta kitöltött prospektív skálák, például a menstruációs tünetek hatásának és súlyosságának prospektív nyilvántartása, továbbá a problémák súlyosságának napi nyilvántartási skálája jelent segítséget. A terápiás terv kialakításakor fontos figyelembe venni a tünetek súlyosságát, a nő fogamzási terveit vagy fogamzásgátlási igényeit, a társuló egyéb betegségeit és a korábbi kezelési módszerekre adott válaszát. A terápiás lehetőségek közé tartozik – a PMS és a PMDD súlyosságától függően – a rendszeres aerob testmozgás, a stresszoldás, a kognitív viselkedésterápia, a gyógyszeres kezelések (szelektív szerotoninvisszavétel-gátlók, kombinált oralis ösztrogén-progesztin fogamzásgátlók, GnRH-agonisták).

      "abstract": "El delirio de relacion sensitivo representa un tipo determinado de enferme­ dad o un tipo reactivo paranoico bien caracterizado por su etiologia, sus sintomas y la forma de su evolucion. Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad. Los representantes mas perfilados de este grupo caracterial son individuos complicados, de elevada inteligencia y de gran valor; poseen una sen­ sibilidad fina y profunda, y poseen una etica escrupulosa.

      "title": "Drug-Associated Spontaneous Orgasm: A Case Report and Systematic Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Spontaneous orgasm is characterized by a spontaneous onset of orgasm without any preceding sexual or nonsexual trigger. It sheds insight on the mechanisms underlying orgasms and the sexual response cycle in humans.We report a male patient of repetitive spontaneous orgasm under trazodone treatment and systematically review the literature on drug-associated spontaneous orgasm (DASO).A total of 25 patients (18 women and 7 men), including our reported case, experienced 27 DASO events. Over half of them were under 50 years of age during the DASO event. Depression was the leading morbidity for these patients, and a limited list of antidepressants and antipsychotics were involved in 92.5% of all DASO events. Although offending drugs possess variable pharmacological properties, their common effect is an augmentation of serotonin-1A (5HT1A) neurotransmission. Offending drugs seemingly increase personal susceptibility to DASO. Over half of the patients, especially men, did not concurrently experience sexual arousal or desire during the DASO event. In the remaining patients, the orgasm was accompanied by or ensued with arousal or desire. A reduction of dose or discontinuation of the offending drug usually abolished DASO.It appears that 5HT1A has a key role in generating orgasm. Orgasms may be activated through arousal-independent or arousal-dependent pathways, and both orgasms and sexual arousal are bidirectionally activated. This double-bidirectional model of sexual response cycle may promote the success of sexual procreation and recreation, and further research on this pathway could offer an innovative method to manage anorgasmia in the future.",

      "abstract": "Patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) usually develop significant behavioral disturbances with progression of the disease. We tested our clinical observation that development of disruptive agitation is more likely in semantic than in nonfluent PPA and examined which clinical variables could be associated with this behavior.We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychiatric scores and the need for behavioral treatments in semantic PPA (n = 41) and nonfluent PPA (n = 39) cases and compared first (1-3 years since the onset of symptoms) and last (5-13 years since the onset) evaluations. Clinical variables and laterality of temporal atrophy were associated with symptoms in semantic PPA cases.The semantic PPA group developed more frequent (p = 0.03) and intense agitation (p = 0.0008) and had a greater need for antipsychotic drugs (p = 0.001) than the nonfluent PPA group. Presence of agitation was clearly associated with psychotic symptoms (delusions/hallucinations) but was not associated with gender, age at onset, duration of the disease, or laterality of temporal atrophy. In contrast, nonfluent PPA cases were more frequently depressed and treated with antidepressants (p = 0.0007). There were no differences in anxiety, irritability, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, or abnormal motor behavior.Semantic PPA in advanced disease is frequently associated with agitation and psychotic symptoms with fewer mood symptoms, while nonfluent PPA maintains a high prevalence of depression. This implies different treatment and care and support needs for each group.",

This case expands upon the existing literature on EOAD through the timeline of a complex psychosis presentation accompanied by rapid cognitive decline.63-year-old, Hispanic, woman with progressive cognitive changes (e.g., confusion, forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, disorganization) that emerged 5 years prior to seeking neurological consultation. Psychosis symptoms (i.e., auditory/visual hallucinations, delusions), in the context of real events (i.e., husband's previous infidelity), developed simultaneously. These pervasive symptoms have contributed to social withdrawal, persistent suicidal tendencies, and impaired IADLs. Neuroimaging suggested hypometabolism in the parietotemporal regions with precuneus and posterior cingulate gyri involvement.The evaluation revealed fairly generalized cognitive decline. Basic attention, working memory, visual abstract reasoning, and phonemic fluency were intact. Visual integration/visuoconstruction were reduced.

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

Menstrual psychotic disorder (MPD) is an uncommon condition, not universally accepted within the classifications of functional psychosis; its symptoms are not included under actual definitions of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The MPD diagnosis requires specific features and excludes acute menstrual-related exacerbations of chronic mental conditions and menstrual mood-disorders. Case description We present the prospective case study of a 24-year-old Chinese woman recently arrived in France following marriage, who was admitted on three occasions to an inpatient psychiatric service for symptoms of acute recurrent psychosis developed with the onset of menstrual flow. Each episode was characterized by acute onset with the menstrual bleeding, short duration with full recovery few days after. Pharmacotherapy was instaurated from the first episode (risperidone and other coadjuvant drugs). Discussions This case illustrates the complexity of diagnosis in a person with recurrent presentation of psychotic symptoms associated with menses. In most of the MPD case-reports in literature, no serious psychosocial stress factor was mentioned; the use of psychotropic drugs was also considered inconclusive, successful treatment with hormone therapy being reported in several situations. Although pre-existing psychiatric conditions may exacerbate in the perimenstrual period, the relationship between typical functional psychoses and MPD, and the phenomenology of this disorder needs to be clarified; case-studies may contribute to the recognition of MPD as a specific disease entity.",

Only the early recognition of CSE allows an urgent treatment, the reason why it should be adopted the following practical definition: 5 min or more of continuous seizures or two or more seizures without regain of consciousness between them. The treatment should be immediately initiated whenever a patient has a convulsion that persists more than 5 min, has a second seizure in the posictal period, or experience a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion at the time of arrival in the emergency department. The typical temporal evolution of CSE affects its prognosis since subtil SE is more refractory to treatment than evident SE.

Both acute (duration <3 months) and chronic (duration> 3 months) conditions are investigated through a diagnostic triage: • First, it is clarified whether red flags are present that require prompt action. • Thereafter, we assess whether the pain is due to possible specific diagnoses. • If the patient is in the residual group, a broader assessment is made to identify any treatment options and prognosis. Essential clinical characteristics RED FLAGS Any initial assessment of the patient with back pain is initiated by clinically identifying the few serious diagnoses that require urgent or urgent action: Sphincter symptoms or abnormal sensitivity / reflex conditions of the perineum cause cauda equina syndrome.

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "The Expression of Intimacy and Sexuality in Persons With Dementia",
      "abstract": "Sexuality in dementia is infrequently addressed. Dementia is characterized by a progressive deterioration in all domains of functioning, including loss of sexual function. However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

Teenagers often present with moderate to severe symptoms, while women in the fourth decade of life appear to have worse symptoms with the severity of the disease worsening with increasing age up until menopause. Obesity and smoking have also been identified as risk factors. Symptoms could be physical, psychological, emotional, environmental and/or behavioral and affect the ability to perform normal daily activities as well as adversely affect interpersonal relationships. Though several theories have been propounded, the exact cause of premenstrual syndrome is unknown. Management of this disorder requires a multi-disciplinary approach involving the general practitioner, the general gynecologist or a gynecologist with a special interest in PMS, a mental health professional (psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or counselor), physiotherapist and dietician.",

      "abstract": "Peyronie's disease (PD) is characterized by the formation of palpable fibrotic tissue in the tunica albuginea of the penis. It is thought to manifest in response to recurrent microtrauma during erection in those with risk factors that may include wound-healing disorders. The initial stage of PD is thought to last from 6 to 18 months, and it is characterized by an inflammatory period with pain in approximately one-third of men. This initial phase is followed by a chronic phase when pain typically resolves and the deformity stabilizes with no additional plaque development. PD has been reported to develop in up to 9% of adult males according to published literature, but the incidence may be even higher. The most frequently affected age group is men between 50 and 59 years. Because of the associated penile deformity and effect on sexual relations, psychosocial distress is very common in those with PD. It has been reported to negatively affect self-image, sexual activity, intimacy, and mood, and it is often associated with depression and erectile dysfunction (ED). At this time, nonsurgical treatments are unreliable and have variable efficacy, and surgical treatments are reserved for those with disabling disfigurement. Moreover, surgery may result in loss of penile length and ED, and there are only a few physicians in the United States that perform such surgeries. There is a great need to increase awareness of PD in patients and general practitioners, to elucidate the pathogenesis of PD, and for the development of novel treatments for this disfiguring disease.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

El cuadro clínico de los ataques de cefalea incluye los datos siguientes: son por lo general difusas o bifrontales; empiezan abruptamente en cualquier momento y duran desde minutos a varias horas; en la mayoría de los casos se acompañan de nauseas y vómitos y se siguen de letargia postictal y sueño; no existen factores desencadenantes y responde a los anticonvulsilantes. Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex. Algunos de estos pacientes pueden tener otros fenómenos vegetativos tales como palidez y dolor abdominal; casi todos tíenen nauseas y vómitos.",

      "abstract": "Menopause is the time in a woman's life when she stops menstruating for good.In clinical terms, this reproductive life stage happens 12 months after the date of her last period, so it actually lasts just 24 hours.In everyday conversation, however, we use menopause to refer to perimenopause (the stage when menopausal symptoms begin, which can be several years before menopause), menopause itself, and post-menopause (when symptoms often continue).There are 34 commonly identified symptoms of menopause, some of which are physical (e.g., heavy and/ or erratic periods, hot flushes and night sweats, fatigue, insomnia, and vaginal dryness), and some psychological (e.g., anxiety and depression, memory problems, loss of confidence and difficulties with concentration and focus).Menopause is also unique to the woman who experiences it, although estimates suggest that 75% will have some combination of symptoms, and 25% will find these symptoms debilitating.This is the case in both Latin America and the Global North.Indeed, Blümel et al. (2012) found that nearly 13% of their younger respondents (under 45) had perimenopausal symptoms which 'severely compromised quality of life', peaking amongst those who were four years post-menopause, with 31.6% reporting the same problem (p.549).Although the gradual decline with aging of hormones, like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, is the basis of natural menopause, some women have sudden onset menopause due to surgery, such as a full hysterectomy, which also removes the ovaries, or medication such as Tamoxifen for breast cancer.Equally -at least if we consult data from the Global Northsymptoms usually start to occur in a woman's mid-to-late 40s, and menopause is reached at 51.Even so, about 1% of women go through early menopause (before the age of 45), or premature menopause (before the age of 40).English language research into menopause in the Brazilian and wider Latin American context, however, suggests some compelling differences as well as some similarities between",

      "abstract": "Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is characterized by sensations of physiological genital arousal that occur in the absence of psychological sexual desire. The primary symptom characteristic of PGAD is the presence of persistent, intrusive, and unwanted sensations of genital arousal. The genital arousal is typically localized to the labia minora and/or majora, the clitoris, and the region above the pubic bone. The presence of distress is a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of PGAD, and it is often what leads individuals to seek treatment. Individuals with PGAD often experience a high degree of associated psychosocial impairment. The healthcare experiences of individuals with PGAD appear to share many similarities with what has been reported for other forms of genital discomfort (such as vulvodynia). The etiology of the condition remains unknown. In terms of biological factors, both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system factors have been cited as potential contributors to PGAD.",

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

In most reported cases, men are identified as perpetrators regardless of the sex of the individual assaulted. There typically is some form of relationship between the survivor and the perpetrator-whether it be an acquaintance, friend, family member, or authority figure. As such, female patients should be asked routinely about a history of sexual assault, particularly if the patient reports relevant physical symptoms and/or substance abuse. Factors that could lead to children experiencing sexual assault (particularly via domestic minor sex trafficking) include a history of abuse, substance use, mental health issues, family dysfunction, and the involvement of Child Protective Services. Short-term goals of primary care include management of physical injuries and psychological needs, evaluation for pregnancy, and prevention of sexually transmitted infections. Long-term effects may include sexual dysfunction, mental disorders (eg, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder), and medical symptoms (eg, chronic headache, infections).",

These psychoses do not appear to be of fixed constancy in relation to the total number of births in the community or to the biogenic psychoses in the population. 2. The only consistent or characteristic element in true postpartum psychoses is delirium, which appears in varying intensity. No specific endogenous or exogenous factor is revealed, although complex endocrine imbalance cannot be definitely eliminated at this time. 3. In women of cyclothymic disposition a delirious mania following childbirth may lead to an increased frequency and an easier tendency to manic-depressive cycling, even though subsequent pregnancies do not occur. 4. The purely delirious types which recover rapidly are individuals who are generally of stable pre-psychotic matrix. However, subsequent attacks of delirium occur in some, which indicate a low threshold to this type of psychosis and to no other. 5. The most persistent and tragic residues are found in those women whose personality structure is in the schizothymic direction and whose inheritance is tainted. Here the outstanding trend is to hebephrenic regression.",

      "title": "Menstrual Psychosis with Premenstrual Onset: A case presentation",
      "abstract": "Introduction Menstrual psychosis has an acute onset and is characterised by confusion, stupor and mutism, delusions, hallucinations, or a manic syndrome lasting for a brief duration, with full recovery. These symptoms maintain periodicity in rhythm with the menstrual cycle. The symptoms may appear in the premenstrual phase or may begin with the onset of menstrual flow (catamenial psychoses). Usually, menstrual psychosis has a polymorphism of both psychotic and affective symptoms (Brockington I. Menstrual psychosis. World Psychiatry. 2005;4(1):9-17.). In this article we present a case of menstrual psychosis with premenstrual onset. Objectives A 26 years old, nulliparous single female with one mentally ill relative on her mother’s side (her grandmother) presented with an episodic illness characterized by mood swings, irrelevant speech, irritability, suspiciousness and thought disorder related to her menstrual cycles. She had earlier suffered prolonged attacks of mania, developed a recurrent episodic illness which returned every month for five years. Her menses began at 15. She presented with the history of a few episodes of manic illness starting five days before and ending suddenly with the onset of the menses. Methods On mental status evaluation during the index episode, the patient was agitated, had labile affect, grandiose and referential delusions and erotomania. A detailed physical examination, routine biochemistry, and gonadal hormonal assay were unremarkable. Results She was started on olanzapine 10 mg/day, lithium 1200 mg/day and low-dose clonazepam. Although the severity of the psychotic and affective symptoms gradually reduced during the future menstrual cycles, they did not completely resolve. Conclusions The pathophysiology of menstrual psychosis is not exactly understood, but it has been postulated that fluctuation of the sex hormones occurring during the menstrual cycle is responsible. Previous studies have reported the association of psychosis with estrogen withdrawal (Mahé V, Dumaine A. Oestrogen withdrawal associated psychoses. Acta Psychiatr Scand. 2001;104(5):323-331.). Treatment strategies for menstrual psychosis include the use of oral contraceptive pills for the regulation of hormones during the menstrual cycle, in our case patient did not want to use oral contraceptive pills.

CSB is reported to affect 3% to 6% of the general population in the United States, occurring more frequently in men. It typically begins in the late teens or early twenties and is chronic or intermittent. The disorder has been described as a progression through four stages: preoccupation, ritualization, gratification, and despair. Men with CSB typically focus on physical sexual gratification; women focus on romantic or emotional aspects of sexuality. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, particularly substance use, mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. CSB can lead to medical complications.

      "title": "Voyeurism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Long before voyeurism became a diagnosis, people peeped. An unanticipated opportunity for King David to peep at Bathsheba led him to a train of Biblical woes and Nathan's rebuke. According to old lore, Tom's peeping at Lady Godiva led God to blind him. The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a collection of physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms causing clinically significant distress or interference that occur in the 7 days prior to the onset of menses, after which they become minimal or absent. The diagnosis is established by symptom documentation using a validated, reliable tool such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for at least 2 menstrual cycles to confirm the timing of relevant symptoms. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there is a 1.8%-5.8% 12-month prevalence of PMDD among menstruating women1; however, the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms causing clinically significant interference or distress but not meeting full criteria for a diagnosis of PMDD may be as high as 13%-18%.",

      "title": "Compulsive Masturbation Treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",
      "abstract": "Masturbation can be defined as a person's achieving sexual pleasure which usually results in orgasm by himself or herself (autoeroticism). Masturbation is a normal activity that is common in all stages of life from infancy to old age, but this viewpoint was not always accepted. Freud believed that neurasthenia was caused by excessive masturbation. In the early 1900s, masturbatory insanity was a common diagnosis in hospitals for the criminally insane in the United States. Masturbation is abnormal when it is the only type of sexual activity performed in adulthood, when its frequency indicates a compulsion or sexual dysfunction, or when it is consistently preferred to sex with a partner [1]. Compulsive masturbation does not have a distinct code in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition D.S.M.-V (2013) but can be classified as other specified sexual dysfunction [2]. The I.C.D.–10 classifications (W.H.O., 1992) ha ve a diagnostic category termed “excessive sexual desire” and compulsive masturbation may fall into this category [3]. Compulsive sexual behavior has been characterized as a behavioral addiction and an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder. It has been quantified using the statistic of total sexual outlet (number of orgasms/week). People with compulsive sexual behavior referred for treatment generally show a total sexual outlet of >7 [4]. Early psychological injury, from sexual abuse, physical abuse, exposure to violence, attachment trauma, or early sexualization, is at the root of sexually compulsive behavior [4,5]. Compulsive sexual behavior frequently has associated comorbidities of current mood disorders 33%, anxiety disorders 42% , substance disorders 29% and Personality disorders 46% [6,7]. Physical injury in compulsive masturbation is common. Patients with this disorder may masturbate 5-15 times a day and loneliness is felt keenly after an orgasm. This disorder can interfere in occupational, social, interpersonal, and intimacy functioning. Many different agents have been cited in case reports as helpful in treating compulsive sexual behavior: lithium, buspirone, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics, naltrexone, and topiramate have all been reported to be helpful in treatment of sexual compulsivity [4].",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "The majority of first-episode psychoses are preceded by a prodromal phase that is several years on average, frequently leads to some decline in psychosocial functioning and offers the opportunity for early detection within the framework of an indicated prevention. To this, two approaches are currently mainly followed. The ultra-high-risk (UHR) criteria were explicitly developed to predict first-episode psychosis within 12 months, and indeed the majority of conversions in clinical UHR samples seem to occur within the first 12 months of initial assessment. Their main criterion, the attenuated psychotic symptoms criterion, captures symptoms that resemble positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) with the exception that some level of insight is still maintained, and these frequently compromise functioning already. In contrast, the basic symptom criteria try to catch patients at increased risk of psychoses at the earliest possible time, i.e. ideally when only the first subtle disturbances in information processing have developed that are experienced with full insight and do not yet overload the person's coping abilities, and thus have not yet resulted in any functional decline. First results from prospective studies not only support this view, but indicate that the combination of both approaches might be a more favorable way to increase sensitivity and detect risk earlier, as well as to establish a change-sensitive risk stratification approach.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome—Psychiatric or Gynaecological Disorder?",
      "abstract": "The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of mental and physical symptoms arising in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms disappear after the onset of menstruation. During the rest of the follicular phase the patient is free from symptoms. The cyclical nature of the symptom variations is characteristic of the syndrome. The lack of a commonly accepted definition and a way to diagnose PMS has led to contradictory results in the search for its aetiology and treatment. The diagnosis of PMS should be based on prospective daily ratings of symptoms and defined criteria of subgroups. In our studies three subgroups can be identified. The \"Pure PMS\" group with significant cyclical symptoms being worse during the luteal phase and no symptoms during the follicular phase. A \"Premenstrual aggravation\" group with symptoms always present but with an aggravation premenstrually. A \"Non-PMS\" group of women who do not suffer from menstrual cycle related symptoms. These three groups show significant differences in the number of patients with an earlier psychiatric history and are different in the extent of neurosis on a personality test. The Pure PMS group had less neurosis and a lower frequency of patients with an earlier psychiatric history. In anovulatory cycles, whether induced or spontaneous, the cyclical nature of symptoms disappeared. This shows the important role that the corpus luteum has in precipitating symptoms in PMS. GnRH-agonists can be used to induce anovulation and this will stop the cyclical changes. Postmenopausal women receiving oestradiol/progestagen sequential treatment develop PMS-like symptoms when progestagen is added to the treatment. Symptoms seem to be dose dependent related to the oestradiol during the luteal but not the folicular phase. The intracerebral effects that cause the symptoms are still unknown. Progesterone metabolites have, however, been shown to interact with the GABA-A receptor in a similar manner to benzodiazepins and barbiturates, and they also have anxiolytic effects. Progesterone metabolites may occur which have the opposite effect on the GABA-A receptor, producing anxiogenic effects.",

Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them.

Menos frecuentemente el motivo de consulta es una cojera o impotencia funcional de aparicion brusca sin un antecedente traumatico previo.

      "title": "Early Detection of Seizure episode in a known case of seizure disorder using WSN",
      "abstract": "A seizure (from the Latin sacire, \"to take possession of\") is a transient occurrence of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal brain activity can have various manifestations, ranging from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena not readily discernible by an observer. Although a variety of factors influence the incidence and prevalence of seizures, ~5-10% of the population will have at least one seizure, with the highest incidence occurring in early childhood and late adulthood. The meaning of the term seizure needs to be carefully distinguished from that of epilepsy. Epilepsy describes a condition in which a person has a risk of recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizure, or recurrent seizures due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have epilepsy (although a single seizure associated with particular clinical or electroencephalographic features may establish the diagnosis of epilepsy). Epilepsy refers to a clinical phenomenon rather than a single disease entity, because there are many forms and causes of epilepsy. However, among the many causes of epilepsy there are various epilepsy syndromes in which the clinical and pathologic characteristics are distinctive and suggest a specific underlying etiology. Using the definition of epilepsy as two or more unprovoked seizures, the incidence of epilepsy is ~0.3-0.5% in different populations throughout the world, and the prevalence of epilepsy has been estimated at 5-30 persons per 1000. A standout amongst the most intriguing uses of WSN is wellbeing observing. In this paper we presented a checking framework dependent on WSN for discovery of epilepsy seizures. This framework can be utilized for patients living in a clinical situation or at their home,where they do just their every day schedule. I.",

      "title": "Resolution of stuttering during ketamine treatment: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stuttering may include repetition of words in whole or part, difficulty saying words, and elongated pauses in speech. Approximately 5% of children stutter for a period lasting 6 months or more. Most of those children stop stuttering as they approach adulthood, but the condition persists in approximately 1% of adults. The cause of stuttering is unknown. Adults who stutter face substantial burdens in many aspects of their lives. Stutterers may choose not to pursue meaningful employment opportunities, may not be hired for positions they seek, or may be denied promotions or positive performance evaluations. Stuttering can cause physical tension from fear of speaking. Social challenges arise when a person who stutters is seen as less capable or of lower intelligence than fluent speakers. Stuttering causes emotional difficulties through the frustration and embarrassment that disfluent speakers feel. Stutterers may experience a general loss of self-esteem and personal satisfaction in life. Speech therapy is the primary intervention for stuttering. Medications have been investigated as treatments for stuttering, but no medication has been identified that has widespread effectiveness. Case presentation A 60-year-old white non-Hispanic woman who had been a near lifelong stutterer was prescribed ketamine for an unrelated condition and experienced an almost immediate resolution of her stuttering. Conclusions Many possible pharmacological treatments for stuttering have been studied. Some medications appear to be effective in some patients; some appear to be more generally effective but have negative side effects. No reporting in relevant literature has addressed a possible role for ketamine in stuttering treatment. On the basis of this case report, research on the effect of ketamine on stuttering would be useful. Any effective treatment for stuttering would have a significant positive effect on quality of life for persons who stutter.",

      "title": "Perioperative Hearing Impairment",
      "abstract": "PERIOPERATIVE hearing loss is a rarely reported phenomenon. However, it occurs more frequently than most anesthesiologists suspect. Perioperative hearing impairment is often subclinical and may go unnoticed unless audiometry is performed. 1–3It can be conductive or sensorineural, unilateral or bilateral, and transient or permanent. 4–8Hearing loss has been reported following virtually every type of anesthetic technique. The hearing mechanism may be less susceptible to acoustic trauma during general anesthesia, 9but other mechanisms are capable of causing both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses (SNHL) in the perioperative period. The etiologies include mechanical, traumatic, noise-induced, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, nitrous oxide, embolism, pharmacologic, and other miscellaneous causes.The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a snail-shaped structure of 2.75 turns with an uncoiled length of approximately 3 cm (fig. 1). The cochlea is divided into three channels. The two outer channels, the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, contain perilymphatic fluid and communicate at the apex through the helicotrema. The middle channel, the scala media (cochlear duct), contains endolymphatic fluid. In the conventional cross-sectional view of the cochlea (fig. 2), the scala media is triangular in shape. Its upper boundary, the vestibular or Reissner's membrane, attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and to the outer wall of the cochlea, separating it from the scala vestibuli. The lower boundary, the basilar membrane, also attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and the outer wall of the cochlea. The basilar membrane supports the hearing organ, the organ of Corti, and separates the scala media from the scala tympani. The lateral wall of the scala media is the highly vascular stria vascularis. At the base of the cochlea, the perilymph of the scala vestibuli contacts the oval window and the perilymph of the scala tympani contacts the round window (figs. 1 and 3).Arterial blood is supplied to the inner ear by the internal auditory artery, which arises from either the basilar or the inferior anterior cerebellar artery and passes through the internal auditory meatus with cranial nerve VIII. The arterial supply to the cochlea is via end vessels, with no collateral circulation. The afferent special somatic exteroceptive cochlear nerve provides innervation. The peripheral processes arise in the organ of Corti, their cell bodies forming the spiral ganglion of the cochlea in the osseous spiral lamina. The processes converge, traversing the modiolus to form the cochlear nerve, which passes through the internal acoustic meatus with the vestibular nerve. A smaller number of efferent nerve fibers arise from the olivary complexes and terminate axodendritically on the afferent dendrites that innervate the inner hair cells.The cochlear fluid system is made up of two fluids, perilymph and endolymph (fig. 2). Perilymph fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani and has an ionic composition, low in potassium and high in sodium, similar to interstitial fluid and nearly identical to CSF. 10There are two theories regarding its origin: (1) it is filtrate produced by capillaries in the spiral ligament; and (2) it is CSF communicated to cochlea through the cochlear aqueduct, a small channel in the temporal bone near the round window, which connects the scala tympani directly to the subarachnoid space. The endolymphatic fluid is unique to the inner ear. It has a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, similar to intracellular fluid. The stria vascularis is believed to be the source of the unique endolymph ionic composition. Although there is slow longitudinal flow of endolymph, maintenance of the critical ionic environment for the organ of Corti is due to local radial flow between the stria vascularis and nearby cells. Endolymphatic absorption takes place in the endolymphatic sac, a specialized structure of the membranous labyrinth. The endolymphatic sac is located in the subdural space and communicates with the membranous labyrinth via the endolymphatic duct (fig. 1). It is thought to participate in balancing endolymphatic pressures with changes in CSF pressure. Two-way flow through a patent cochlear aqueduct provides relatively rapid perilymphatic pressure equilibration with the CSF. Endolymphatic pressure regulation is considerably slower, being primarily a function of production and absorption. Only minor and temporary pressure adjustments are made by the endolymphatic sac.The organ of Corti, the hearing transduction mechanism, is located in the cochlear duct (scala media). The sensory cells of the organ of Corti are mechanoreceptors with stereocilia projecting from the top of the cells into the endolymph. 11There are two types of hair cells, outer (OHC) and inner (IHC) hair cells (fig. 2). They differ in morphology, microanatomical location, and function. The IHCs and OHCs initiate the transduction process by transforming the acoustic signal into neural activity. Activation of the hair cells causes neurotransmitter release that depolarizes afferent dendrites causing an all-or-none spike discharge in individual auditory nerve fibers. Overlying the organ of Corti is a gelatinous flap, the tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is attached on its medial edge to the spiral limbus and laterally is in contact with the stereocilia of the OHCs. Since the tectorial membrane and basilar membrane have different medial attachment locations, upward or downward displacement of basilar membrane induces shearing displacements of the hairs in contact with the tectorial membrane. These various bending movements of the OHC stereocilia can cause excitation or inhibition. Excitation initiates the transduction of acoustic energy into neural signals. In contrast to OHCs, the stereocilia of the IHC are not embedded in the tectorial membrane but rest in a groove near the undersurface of the tectorial membrane. The IHC do not respond to displacement of the basilar membrane, but they do respond to the velocity of displacement of the basilar membrane. The neural signals initiated by the IHCs and OHCs are transmitted through the acoustic division of cranial nerve VIII ultimately to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.A simplified diagram of the cochlea uncoiled is usually used to describe cochlear mechanics (fig. 3). On the left is the base of the cochlea with the stapes and oval window. Below these structures and adjoining the scala vestibuli is the round window of the scala tympani. In the diagram, the uncoiled cochlea is divided horizontally by a line representing the scala media, Reissner's membrane, the organ of Corti, and the basilar membrane. However, this line, for purposes of understanding cochlear mechanics, can be thought of as simply the basilar membrane. Above the dividing line is the scala vestibuli, and below is the scala tympani. Because of the inertia of the fluid mass and frictional resistance to fluid flow in the narrow channels of the scala, inward or outward motion of the stapes against the oval window causes a pressure wave to travel down the scala; there is no fluid flow. Since the fluids are incompressible within the bony cochlea, the pressure wave traveling down the scala vestibuli causes the basilar membrane to deflect downward toward the scala tympani for positive pressures and upward for negative pressures. The flexible round window compensates for pressure changes transmitted to the scala tympani. For the acute changes caused by pressure waves in the audible frequencies, the connection between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, the helicotrema, functions as though it were closed. The helicotrema is only involved in very slow equalization of pressures between the two scalae.The most important property of the basilar membrane is its ability to separate various frequencies. The compliance of the basilar membrane changes by a factor of greater than 100 from base to apex. At the base, near the oval window, the basilar membrane is narrower and thicker, making it less compliant (fig. 3). It is wider and thinner at the apex, resulting in greater compliance. Since a system's resonant frequency is directly proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to mass, the stiff base responds maximally to high frequencies (> 4,000 Hz), and the compliant apex responds maximally to low frequencies (< 1,000 Hz). In short, the basilar membrane functions as a sharply tuned bandpass filter, performing a spectral analysis on the incoming sound (pressure) waves. The effect is to translate the frequency of incoming sound into distance along the basilar membrane, a frequency-to-place or tonotopical transformation. Therefore, both IHCs and OHCs at a specific point along the basilar membrane respond to a very specific, narrow frequency range. Excited hair cells depolarize specific acoustic neurons, and the information is finally interpreted in the auditory centers.Clinical or subclinical hearing loss following spinal anesthesia or lumbar puncture has been reported frequently(table 1). 4,6–8,12–24Despite many reports, few anesthesiologists appear to be aware of the possibility of this complication. Since there has been no large-scale audiometric study of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia, the precise incidence of clinical or subclinical hearing loss is unknown but may occur more frequently than appreciated. Further, the specific presentation and onset of the hearing deficit after spinal anesthesia can vary widely.The first case of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia 25was reported in 1914. In 1956, Vandam and Dripps 26reported that of 9,277 patients who had spinal anesthesia, 0.4% experienced auditory difficulties, such as impaired hearing, tinnitus, buzzing, or roaring. Few specific data were gathered, and no audiometry of these patients was performed. Michel et al. 27described nine cases of hearing loss following myelography, diagnostic lumbar puncture, and spinal anesthesia. The hearing deficits were almost uniformly in the lower frequencies (125–1,000 Hz). The deficits were bilateral in six of the nine patients. Six of the nine patients had full recoveries in less than 1 month without treatment.In addition to these case reports, there have been several studies of hearing loss related to spinal anesthesia. In one study, 6 of 14 patients had audiometrically detectable mild hearing deficits in the low-frequency range that resolved spontaneously in 1–7 months. 28Walsted et al. 29tested 34 patients with audiometry before and after spinal anesthesia. Most of the patients had a small but significant threshold shift at 500 Hz. However, one patient developed a considerable unilateral hearing loss in the low-frequency range, which persisted until an epidural blood patch was performed. Gultekin et al. 30used pure tone audiometry to test hearing before and after spinal anesthesia for hernia repair. Fourteen patients (32%), despite being unaware of it, had audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing losses. All spinal anesthetics were performed with 22-gauge Quincke needles (needle gauge and design are discussed in the next section), and the authors suggested that hearing loss was less frequent when the anesthetic agent was bupivacaine rather than prilocaine. In 35 patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia (24-gauge Sprotte needle), pure tone audiometry revealed that five patients had developed low-frequency hearing loss on the first postoperative day. 31The deficits were unilateral in three patients and bilateral in the other two. All patients had full recovery without treatment by the fifth postoperative day. In contrast, Finegold et al. 32found no audiometric hearing decrement postoperatively in 44 patients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Half of the patients' spinals were performed with 25-gauge Quincke needles; 24-gauge Sprotte needles were used for the other half. This is the only study of 13 found that failed to show a relationship between spinal anesthesia and hearing loss. Hearing acuity is affected by hormonal changes, 33,34but peripartum changes have not been documented. The explanation for this singular result may be in the study's methodology.In a study of 100 patients undergoing elective urologic procedures under spinal anesthesia, eight patients experienced noticeable hearing impairment. 18Audiometry was performed on three of the patients and revealed a 30-dB loss in the low-frequency range. Hearing deficits resolved within a short time without treatment. In another study of 100 patients undergoing elective general or urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia, 16 had audiometrically documented hearing losses. 3The hearing loss typically affected only the frequencies between 125 and 2,000 Hz. The deficits were usually detected on the second day after the spinal anesthetic and in all cases resolved within 3 days without treatment. The incidence of hearing loss after spinal anesthesia for men under 30 yr of age was compared to that in men over the age of 60. 35Fifty-two percent (13 of 25) of the younger and 16% of the older patients had significant hearing losses (≤ 10 dB) confined to the low-frequency range (125–500 Hz). There was no hearing impairment in the speech frequencies (500–2,000 Hz) and higher frequencies for either group. No patient was aware of a hearing deficit, and no patient developed a post–dural puncture headache (PDPH). In a recent study of hearing loss following spinal versus general anesthesia, there were audiometric losses in both groups, although the spinal group had significantly greater hearing losses, particularly in the low-frequency range. 36Interestingly, in the spinal group, increases in the low-frequency audible threshold were inversely related to the preoperative low-frequency audible threshold.Overall, it appears that 10–50% of patients receiving spinal anesthesia experience an audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing deficit. Less than one fourth of these patients have a clinical, or noticeable, hearing loss.The size of the needle used for dural puncture appears to play a role in postspinal anesthetic hearing impairment. The hearing loss may be a result of CSF leakage even when the CSF loss is insufficient to cause a PDPH. Fog et al. 2found that 13 of 14 patients whose spinal anesthetics were performed with a 22-gauge needle had a 10-dB or greater hearing loss across the audible frequency range with significantly greater losses in the low-frequency range. Only 4 of the 14 patients in whom a 26-gauge needle was used had similar hearing impairment, and none had significant (> 10 dB) losses. When spinal anesthesia was performed with a 26-gauge needle, 37only one of nine patients was found to have a low-frequency hearing loss, which was severe but transient. Interestingly, this patient also experienced a PDPH. In another study of 100 patients, 50 had spinal anesthesia using either a 20- or a 22-gauge needle. Of these, 10% had significant decreases in audiometric values in the 250- to 500-Hz frequency range on the first postoperative day that resolved spontaneously within 5 days. 38In the 50 patients in whom 24- and 25-gauge needles were used, no decrement in audiometric values occurred. Oncel et al. 1used pure tone audiometry at 125 Hz preoperatively and postoperatively to assess hearing loss. Three groups of 15 patients were studied. One group received epidural anesthesia. In the other two groups, spinal anesthesia was performed with either a 22- or 25-gauge needle. No hearing impairments were detected in the epidural group. There was significantly greater hearing loss in the 22-gauge group versus the 25-gauge spinal group. None of the study patients developed a PDPH. The authors suggested that pure tone audiometry may be a more sensitive indicator of CSF leakage than the presence of PDPH.Needle design may also play a role in hearing impairment following lumbar puncture. Using audiometry, Sundberg et al. 39compared the effect of 22-gauge cutting-tip (Quincke) to 22-gauge pencil-point (Whitacre) needles on postspinal hearing loss. A hearing loss of at least 10 dB at two or more frequencies below 1,000 Hz was observed in 6 of 25 (24%) patients in the Quincke group as compared to only 2 of 23 (9%) in the Whitacre group. In addition, of those patients with hearing deficits, the mean hearing level was significantly worse in the Quincke group. This study suggests an association between the design of the spinal needle tip and postoperative hearing dysfunction that is similar to the relationship between the needle types and the incidence of PDPH, implying a similar pathogenesis. Lamberg et al. , 40using audiometric testing, compared hearing losses after a single-shot spinal with a 25-gauge Quincke needle with those following a continuous spinal anesthetic (19-gauge Touhy-type needle and 22-gauge catheter). None of the patients developed a PDPH or were aware of a hearing loss. However, nine (43%) of the single-shot patients and seven (37%) of continuous spinal patients had hearing deficits in excess of 10 dB when tested postoperatively. This result also seems to parallel experience with the cause and incidence of PDPH.In summary, hearing impairment following neuraxial anesthesia seems to be related to the same factors (age, needle gauge, and needle type) that are implicated in CSF leakage and PDPH. 41Two of the studies cited above included a total of 27 patients who received epidural anesthesia. Audiometric testing did not reveal measurable postoperative auditory impairment in any of these patients. On the other hand, the consensus of the studies indicates a consistent rate (10–50%) of SNHL in the low frequencies after lumbar puncture. Also, postspinal hearing impairment resolved without treatment, usually within several days, again suggesting an etiology common with that of PDPH. Interestingly, in two reports, patients who received epidural blood patches for PDPH had simultaneous reversal of their postspinal, low-frequency hearing loss. 4,29Cerebrospinal fluid leakage can cause a decrease in the CSF pressure that may be transmitted to the inner ear. A relative balance in the endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures maintains the normal structural conformation in the inner ear. Disruption of this pressure balance can cause hearing impairment as well as impairment of semicircular canal function. A change in CSF pressure is promptly transmitted through a patent cochlear aqueduct to the inner ear perilymph (fig. 2). 6,42–45A decrease in CSF pressure following a dural puncture and CSF leak would cause a rapid and similar decrease in perilymph pressure. The endolymphatic system, however, responds much more slowly. Endolymphatic pressure–volume adjustments are primarily the result of altered endolymph production at the stria vascularis or altered absorption at the endolymphatic sac. Therefore, an acute drop in CSF pressure could result in endolymphatic pressure sufficiently exceeding that of the perilymph to cause distortions of both Reissner's membrane and the basilar membrane. The consequent disruption in the position of the hair cells results in hearing impairment. 10This mechanism has been postulated in several reports. 3,6,8,46Walsted et al. 47proposed such a mechanism in 1991. Later, in controlled prospective studies of neurosurgical patients and in animal studies, she showed the relationship between CSF loss and low-frequency hearing impairment. 48–52The finding that the degree of hearing impairment is correlated with the size of the spinal needle further supports the theory that postspinal hearing loss and PDPH share a common etiology: leakage of CSF from the subarachnoid space. 1,2Distortion of the basilar membrane and hearing loss could also be caused by acute increases in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph. In a case report, Hardy 53postulated that injection into the epidural space caused an acute increase in CSF pressure that was immediately transmitted through the cochlear aqueduct to the perilymph, thus distorting the basilar membrane and causing an acute low-frequency hypoacusis.Finally, if the mechanism of postspinal hearing loss is the same as for PDPH, several questions arise: why do we not see as many patients with vestibular symptoms; why does not every patient with a severe PDPH experience hearing impairment; and why are some hearing losses unilateral? In response to the first question, not only are the changes in CSF pressure transmitted less rapidly to the vestibular apparatus, but the vestibular apparatus is somewhat less sensitive than the cochlea to perilymph–endolymph pressure imbalances. Further, the hearing deficit may be subclinical, not obvious without audiometric testing. In answer to the second question, as many as 7% of adults have an anatomically obstructed cochlear aqueduct, and as many as 30% have a functionally obstructed aqueduct. 44,45,54For these patients, CSF pressure changes are not transmitted to the perilymph, and, therefore, a severe PDPH could exist without a hearing deficit. This mechanism may also explain the cases of unilateral hearing deficit. In addition, restricted cochlear aqueduct flow and the mechanical compliance of the cochlear windows can limit the stress of CSF pressure changes.The reports cited above indicate that the great majority of hearing deficits that result from lumbar puncture or CSF loss occur in the low frequencies and, in most cases, bilaterally. We propose that this is the result of the physical characteristics of the basilar membrane. At the cochlear base, where higher frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is narrow, thick, and stiff, and therefore resistant to pressure changes that are not in its resonant frequency range (fig. 3). At the cochlear apex, where low frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is much more compliant. Changes in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph can cause significant static displacement of the basilar membrane, disrupting the normal OHC relationship to the tectorial membrane and resulting in low-frequency hearing loss. Hearing loss confined to the low frequencies is unlikely due to CSF pressure–mediated stretch or pressure injury to cranial nerve VIII.It is interesting to note that the low-frequency hearing loss observed in Ménière's syndrome involves a similar mechanism. In Ménière's syndrome, instead of a decrease in perilymphatic pressure relative to endolymphatic pressure, there is an increase in endolymphatic pressure (endolymphatic hydrops). This imbalance in pressures would cause a similar distortion of the basilar membrane with the greatest effect at the cochlear apex and resulting, at least in the early stages, in a hearing loss (low frequency) similar to that which can occur after spinal anesthesia.Presuming that hearing impairment following spinal anesthesia or dural puncture has the same etiology as PDPH, i.e. , loss of CSF or decreased CSF pressure, then the treatment and prognosis should be similar. Figure 4indicates that untreated hearing impairments following dural puncture recover fully greater than 95% of the time. Several authors have noted improvement in auditory symptoms after an epidural blood patch. 4,29,55Lybecker et al. 46prospectively studied the effects of an epidural blood patch on hearing in patients with severe PDPH caused by dural puncture. They performed audiometry at several frequencies 1 h before and 1 h after an epidural blood patch. Twelve of the 16 patients had significant audiometric improvement in hearing. Simply changing position from sitting to supine improved hearing in half of the patients in the absence of the blood patch. This study offers clear evidence of the potential efficacy of epidural blood patch for post–dural puncture hearing loss. In another case report in which conservative measures followed by two epidural blood patches failed to relieve a severe PDPH and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss, an epidural dextran 40 infusion relieved the headache and reversed the hearing loss. 56Rosenberg et al. 57performed an audiometric study of 20 patients undergoing surgery with interscalene brachial plexus block anesthesia. Four of the patients (20%) experienced hearing impairment at various frequencies on the side of the block. The low frequencies (250–500 Hz) were affected in only one patient who also had hearing threshold decrements on the opposite side of 15–20 dB measured in the 6,000- to 10,000-Hz range (table 2). Farrell et al. 58described four patients with sudden permanent deafness following anesthesia for dental surgery. Anesthesia for three of the patients was local infiltration or nerve block, and the fourth had general anesthesia. The patient who had general anesthesia had bilateral SNHL, while the three other patients had ipsilateral SNHL. Similarly, Shenkman et al. 59reported a case in which permanent neurologic symptoms, ipsilateral hearing impairment, a facial nerve palsy, and ataxia occurred following an inferior alveolar nerve block. These findings are summarized in table 2.Within 24 h after the interscalene blocks, all four of the patients had spontaneous resolution of their hearing deficits. 57The authors postulated that the mechanism of hearing loss involved an effect due to sympathetic blockade. Vasodilation caused by the sympathetic block may have developed, resulting in edema of the mucosal membranes of both the Eustachian tube and the middle ear and producing a hearing decrement on that side. The hearing loss resolved within 24 h without treatment in all four patients.With regard to the hearing deficits following dental procedures, the authors 58,59could not identify a specific etiology for any of the cases. Several possibilities were considered. Noise-induced hearing loss from dental drills is known to result in temporary, noise-induced, bilateral hearing deficits. 60Dental extractions are known to cause microemboli that could reach the cochlear vasculature and cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment. 58Vasoconstrictors are usually used with local anesthesia for dental procedures. Intravascular injection could cause vasospasm of the cochlear division of the internal auditory artery. 58Finally, nociceptive afferents or autonomic nerve fibers could initiate a reflex vasoconstriction of critical vessels to the hearing structures. Hearing loss during dental procedures appears to be quite rare and usually temporary.Hearing impairment after general anesthesia for non–cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is rare. Our review of the English language literature through 2001 revealed only 35 reported (29 documented audiometrically) cases of hearing loss after general anesthesia (table 3).Evan et al. 61reported three cases of SNHL following general anesthesia; one patient recovered, and the other two sustained permanent hearing loss. The authors were unable to elucidate the etiology in any of the patients. Cox and Sargent 62reported three cases of hearing loss following nonotologic surgery. Two patients had permanent, profound unilateral hearing loss, and one patient had moderate bilateral hearing loss. Velazquez 63described a case of acute unilateral hearing deficit following abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Other authors have described bilateral hearing impairment immediately following minor abdominal surgeries. 64,65It should also be noted that some patients who receive general anesthesia come to the operating room from an intensive care unit having already sustained an unrecognized hearing loss. Halpern et al. 66have discussed the myriad causes of hearing loss in the critical care setting.Although the etiology of hearing loss associated with general anesthesia often cannot be ascertained, there are a number of potential etiologies: changes in middle ear pressure, vascular pathology, CSF pressure changes, embolism, ototoxic drugs, and other miscellaneous causes.Excessive or sudden changes in middle ear pressure can disrupt the tympanic membrane, the round window, and the conducting structures. Excessive middle ear pressure can cause the round window to rupture, resulting in significant hearing loss. 67,68This type of injury has been described as occurring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 69Two patients who were successfully resuscitated developed partial deafness, one from disarticulation of the incomalleal joint and the other from an oval window perilymph fistula. It was postulated that during vigorous mask ventilation, excessive pressure was suddenly transmitted through the Eustachian tube causing the middle ear injuries.Nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthesia was shown in the late 1960s to be capable of causing oscillations of middle ear pressures that could result in tympanic perforation and cause hearing loss. 70,71Depending on the uptake or elimination phase, N2O can displace tympanic membrane grafts outward or inward and disrupt reconstructed middle ear conducting structures. Segal et al. 72described a case of labyrinthine membrane rupture and sustained SNHL due to elevated intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. The degree of intratympanic pressure fluctuation is a function of N2O concentration and its rate of change. Several cases of middle ear injury have been described as resulting from sudden changes in intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. 73–77Further, the patency of the Eustachian tube may play a role in potential injury during N2O anesthesia. During N2O elimination, Eustachian tube obstruction can result in significant negative middle ear pressure and tympanic perforation. 78A vascular pathogenesis is another possible mechanism for hearing impairment after general anesthesia.

      "title": "Treatment of premature ejaculation",
      "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual disorder, and it may have a profound negative impact on a man and his partner's lives. Different organizations and societies have no consensus on the definition and classifications of PE. However, most organizations and societies include in their definitions the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), the control of ejaculation, and the distress or impact of interpersonal difficulties. Evaluation procedures have been standardized in clinical studies by the development of an objective measurement of IELT (using a stopwatch) and by the introduction of patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires on ejaculation control and sexual satisfaction. The identification of four different patterns of PE—lifelong, acquired, normal variant, and premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction—is critical because of different underlying pathogeneses and consequently different management approaches. The optimal treatment for PE should be individualized, based on a patient's symptoms, expectations, and underlying variant causes. Most lifelong PE patients need pharmacotherapy (possibly in combination with psychosexual counseling) as a first-line treatment because of the underlying neurobiological etiology and the impact of PE on the couple's relationship. The management of acquired PE is etiologically specific and may include pharmacotherapy for erectile function management in men with comorbid erectile dysfunction (ED). Men with natural variable PE complain of early ejaculation in situational or coincidental conditions; the ejaculation is inconsistent and occurs irregularly. Psychoeducation and reassurance are indicated for men with this type of PE. Psychotherapy or sex counseling is the first choice of treatment for men with premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction. All pharmacotherapies such as long-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or on-demand topical anesthetics are off-label indications, The benefits of pharmacotherapy toward improving ejaculation times should be weighed against their safety profiles. The development of the short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dapoxetine hydrochloride (30 mg and 60 mg) for oral on-demand use opened a new era of PE treatment. Other potential pharmacotherapies such as tramadol, lidocaine/prilocaine spray, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are still under development. Their safety and efficacy profiles should be further evaluated and supported by additional clinical studies.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

Psychoanalytic observation of psychosomatic patients (and others as well) reveals that the inability to name, recognize, contain or work through one's affective states is frequently one manifestation of defensive structures of a psychotic kind (more radical than denial which deals with certain neurotic anxieties). Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

      "abstract": "Abstract Numerous psychopathological syndromes have been attributed to posttraumatic stress, both at the time of the trauma and many years later. To date, however, there is little literature on pseudodementia as a delayed traumatic stress response. The authors present a case history of a 50‐year‐old woman who developed severe cognitive impairment following retrieval of previously forgotten memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her cognitive condition deteriorated rapidly and dramatically. Neuropsychological assessment and clinical presentation led to a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (vs. corticobasal degeneration). Detailed neurologic and medical evaluations could not identify any underlying physical cause. Her condition progressively worsened over 9 months, at which point memantine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist, was begun. The patient regained full functioning over the next year. Although an organic cause could not be ruled out, it was likely that recovery of traumatic memories was contributory to the patient's condition, as ongoing psychotherapy had begun 1 year into the course. If additional cases with similar presentations are reported, such cases would corroborate the notion that persistent, severe, and reversible cognitive impairment constitutes a previously unrecognized and atypical posttraumatic response.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "title": "First oral treatment zuranolone’s FDA approval and its impact on postpartum depression: a new hope – a correspondence",
      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of mood disorder that affects some individuals after they give birth. It is characterized by a range of emotional and physical symptoms that can significantly impact a new parent's well-being, their ability to care for their baby, and their overall quality of life. PPD typically occurs within the first few weeks or months after childbirth, but it can develop anytime during the first year. New parents with PPD often experience intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness. Irritability, mood swings, and excessive crying are also common. PPD can manifest with physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite (either overeating or loss of appetite), and disruptions in sleep patterns (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much). Individuals with PPD might have trouble concentrating, making decisions, or focusing on tasks1. PPD affects a significant number of new parents in the United States. It is estimated that around one in seven women (or about 14–20%) experience PPD after giving birth. Women who have previously experienced PPD are at a higher risk of experiencing it again with subsequent pregnancies. The recurrence rate for PPD is estimated to be around 30–50%. Many cases of PPD go undiagnosed and untreated. Only about 15% of individuals with PPD receive professional help2. In 2017, a research study revealed that suicide constituted ~5% of perinatal fatalities among Canadian women, predominantly happening within the initial 3 months following childbirth due to PPD3. Current treatment of PPD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline and fluoxetine are commonly prescribed for PPD (Table 1). Table 1 - Pharmacological treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often considered first-line treatments for postpartum depression (PPD). They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) SNRIs like venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) also affect serotonin levels, but they additionally impact norepinephrine. These medications can be effective for PPD in some cases. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) While less commonly prescribed due to potential side effects, TCAs like amitriptyline and nortriptyline may be considered when other options are not effective or well-tolerated. Atypical antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an example of an atypical antidepressant that affects both dopamine and norepinephrine. It can be used as an alternative for individuals who have not responded to SSRIs or SNRIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs like phenelzine (Nardil) are usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed due to their potential interactions with certain foods and medications. Yet, these medications can take weeks to work and may lead to side effects. Concerns about breastfeeding can also impact treatment decisions. Estrogen therapy stabilizes hormone levels linked to PPD, but it is still being studied, and its risks and side effects need more investigation. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps manage PPD symptoms by changing negative thought patterns. However, access to qualified therapists can be limited, and attending regular sessions might be challenging for new mothers. Recently FDA approved first oral treatment of zuranolone to treat PPD4. Zuranolone belongs to a class of drugs known as positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. GABA-A receptors are critical components of the central nervous system that play a crucial role in regulating mood, anxiety, and other emotional states. Zuranolone's mechanism of action involves enhancing the activity of GABA-A receptors. GABA-A receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, and their activation leads to a reduction in neuronal excitability, thereby promoting relaxation and calming effects. By acting as a positive allosteric modulator, zuranolone amplifies the response of GABA-A receptors to the neurotransmitter GABA, resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant effects4. For treating PPD, the efficacy of Zurzuvae in adults was assessed by conducting two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and multicenter studies5. During this phase 3 trial with a double-blind design, women experiencing severe PPD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a daily dosage of 50 mg zuranolone or a placebo for a period of 14 days. The primary focus of the study was to assess the change in the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from their initial state on day 15. Noteworthy secondary objectives included measuring changes in HAM-D scores on days 3, 28, and 45, as well as evaluating the alteration in severity based on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-S) on day 15. Throughout the trial, adverse events were closely monitored and recorded. Among the 196 patients who were randomly assigned (zuranolone, N=98; placebo, N=98), a total of 170 participants (86.7%) successfully completed the 45-day study period. The utilization of zuranolone in comparison to the placebo yielded statistically notable enhancements in depressive symptoms by day 15. Moreover, significant amelioration in depressive symptoms was also noted5. Zuranolone can be more discreet and less stigmatizing compared to other forms of treatment, such as injections or hospital visits. This may encourage more individuals to seek help for their PPD symptoms. It will have higher rates of patient compliance since they are simple to take and integrate into daily routines. It can be distributed through a wider range of healthcare settings, potentially increasing accessibility to PPD treatment in both urban and rural areas. It can provide flexibility in dosing, allowing healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans to the individual needs of each patient. It can facilitate early intervention for PPD and has the potential to reduce hospitalization. Although zuranolone's FDA approval for PPD is promising, there are still some challenges to consider for its use. Not all individuals may respond equally to zuranolone, leading to variations in its effectiveness. Some women might experience significant improvements, while others might not see the same results. Like any medication, zuranolone could potentially have side effects ranging from mild to severe. Balancing the benefits with the potential risks is essential. The long-term effects of using zuranolone, especially during the postpartum period, need further exploration. Monitoring its impact on both maternal health and infant development is crucial. The accessibility of zuranolone could be a concern, as new medications might initially have a higher cost and limited availability, potentially limiting access for some individuals. Zuranolone's interactions with other medications or treatments that postpartum women might be taking should be thoroughly studied to avoid any adverse effects. PPD is a complex condition that can vary greatly between individuals. Finding the right dosage and treatment plan tailored to each woman's needs might require careful consideration. While zuranolone offers a pharmacological approach, it is important not to overlook the benefits of psychosocial interventions, such as therapy and support groups, in the overall treatment plan. Overcoming the stigma associated with PPD and seeking help is a challenge. Some women might be hesitant to use medication due to concerns about judgment or societal perceptions. Healthcare providers need to be adequately educated about zuranolone and its potential benefits and limitations to make informed decisions and provide comprehensive care. Determining the appropriate duration of zuranolone treatment and ensuring a smooth transition to other forms of support after discontinuation are important aspects to address. There remains a need for comprehensive studies that delve deeper into its long-term effects, interactions with other medications, and its impact on diverse populations. Rigorous clinical trials and longitudinal studies can provide invaluable insights into the treatment's efficacy, safety, and potential limitations. The approval of zuranolone could potentially have a broader impact beyond its application in PPD. As researchers and clinicians gain a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, there is a possibility that zuranolone's insights may extend to other mental health conditions.

      "title": "Evaluación del estado de conciencia con la prueba de Folstein, en pacientes bajo anestesia general, sometidos a cirugía de columna",
      "abstract": "Las estructuras responsables de la conciencia son el sistema reticular ascendente y la corteza cerebral, las cuales deben tener un funcionamiento normal para el despertar del paciente; de igual forma, cualquier alteracion estructural o funcional en el transcurso de la anestesia se pondra de manifiesto con una recuperacion lenta de la conciencia o en un estado de inconsciencia mantenido(1). Numerosas alteraciones metabolicas pueden ser responsables de los trastornos de la conciencia en el postoperatorio, aunque la mayoria no surgen de forma espontanea en el intraoperatorio(2,3). Por ello, una exploracion neurologica superficial es obligada en todo paciente que ingresa y egresa de sala de quirofano, y una determinacion de parametros bioquimicos puede ser necesaria (examenes de laboratorio), asi como la revision detallada de los antecedentes personales y de los acontecimientos intraoperatorios, siempre que no exista un suceso que justifique el problema. La disfuncion cognitiva postoperatoria es un sindrome especifico conocido, con una incidencia que oscila en forma muy variada; segun las diferentes estadisticas, se encuentra entre 0% hasta 79% dependiendo de multiples variables como son el tipo de cirugia, periodo estudiado, poblacion y tipo de test psicologico que se haya implementado. Dado que el deficit cognitivo puede acompanarse de aumento de la morbilidad, sus repercusiones sobre la estadia en el hospital y el costo por paciente pueden ser importantes(4-6). El MMS fue desarrollado por Folstein, et al. (1975) como un metodo practico para facilitar al clinico el graduar el estado cognoscitivo del paciente y poder detectar demencia o delirium. El MMS evalua la orientacion espacial y temporal, el recuerdo inmediato (fijacion), la memoria a medio termino y habilidades de sustraccion serial o el deletreo hacia atras.

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

The PTSD (prevalence 1%) occurs from 24 to 48 hours after a difficult childbirth. Anxiety predominates in association with nightmares and recurrent images of the experience. Baby-blues (prevalence 80%) is a feeling of sadness that doesn't need to be treated. It occurs around the third day of post-partum. Its intensity is a predictive factor of postnatal depression. Puerperal psychosis (prevalence 0.2%) is a disturbance of psychotic or manic proportion, mainly in women with a psychiatric previous history. It occurs between the first and the third week of the post-partum period. Postnatal depression (prevalence 20%) is a major depressive state commencing four to six weeks after delivery. It is rarely diagnosed early and child abuse is one of its consequences. Prevention--the important point of the treatment--is most of the time neglected.",

These situations are associatively connected to the past but the patient is unaware of the connection. Acting out has to be differentiated from other neurotic actions which occur during analysis. In particular it has to be differentiated from symptomatic actions and abreaction experiences. Acting out differs from symptomatic actions in that the symptomatic act is ego alien and usually refers to part of a past situation. Acting out occurs very frequently during analysis. It should be remembered, however, that it also occurs outside the realm of psychoanalysis, but then it is not available for investigation and interpretation. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of acting out during the course of analysis is bound up with the transference.",

      "title": "Case report: Depression in an older patient with dysgeusia as the initial symptom",
      "abstract": "Introduction Depression is the most common mental illness among older adults, with substantial and persistent mood depression as the main clinical feature, which is unfavorable for improvement. The clinical manifestations can range from melancholy to grief or even numbness. Approximately one-third of older adult patients exhibit physical discomfort as the first symptom; dysgeusia as the first symptom, is very rare in clinical practice. Dysgeusia is a clinical symptom with no specific objective indicator; thus, the likelihood of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis is high. Case presentation In this study, a 60-year-old female housewife with elementary school as her highest level of education, presented to the outpatient department with dysgeusia, poor sleep, and poor mood persisting for &amp;gt;1 year, which aggravated 2 weeks before hospital visit. Psychiatric examination showed clear consciousness; the patient was cleanly and timely dressed and demonstrated self-care but had a worrisome expression. Using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition), a diagnosis of a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Following pharmacological and psychological treatment, the patient’s condition improved. The patient was compliant to treatment (10 mg/day of escitalopram), had a stable mood, good sleep, and no dysgeusia at &amp;gt;2 years of follow-up as an outpatient. She was able to do housework and take care of her children normally and did not complain about any other issues. Conclusion Physical discomfort is a very common complaint in older patients with depression. If persistent physical symptoms do not improve after repeated medical treatment, timely assessment of the patient’s mental state or psychiatric referral should be considered to diagnose geriatric depression. Timely pharmacological and psychological therapy are the preferred treatment for older adults.",

      "title": "Pruritus Ani",
      "abstract": "Summary Pruritus ani, although it presents as the only symptom, never occurs alone, but is associated with bizarre gastrointestinal symptoms and sexual disorders. Depressive and paranoid trends are common. It is the leading symptom in a syndrome. This syndrome exists in its own right. No distinct personality type could be established; it was found to occur without personality disorder, in psychoneurotic and prepsychotic personalities, and in frank psychoses. Its origin can be traced to a reactivation in adult life of infantile (unconscious) fantasies about procreation centering round the anal function, which precede genital interest and knowledge of sex. These \"cloacal\" fantasies are revived in their original primitive mode, as bodily sensations rather than ideas; the symptoms thus represent the fantasy. They appear as distressing somatic symptoms because such archaic fantasies are incompatible with reality. A breakthrough into consciousness is thus prevented and psychotic delusions avoided. Revival of procreation fantasies must be more deeply disturbing in the man than in the woman; this is borne-out by the greater severity, longer duration, and preponderance of male cases. The syndrome is capable of reduction by psychotherapy. The structure of this syndrome is simpler than that of the psychoneuroses. By the absence of overt anxiety it can be separated from anxiety hysteria, and by the absence of true obsessions, with their tendency to displacement and spread, from obsessive-compulsive neurosis. Secondary gain is absent. Its psychopathology suggests a hypochondriacal syndrome with specific content. Freud classed hypochondria among the \"actualneuroses\" to which psychoanalysis had little to contribute. In psychiatry proper hypochondria is also a stepchild. Brachet speaks of it as a \"disorder of the imagination.\" Gillespie8 defines \"the syndrome of hypochondria\" as, \"A mental preoccupation with a real or supposititious physical or mental disorder, a discrepancy between the degree of preoccupation and the grounds for it, so that the former is far in excess of what is justified, and an affective condition best described as interest with conviction and consequent concern, and with an indifference to the opinion of the environment, including irresponsiveness to persuasion… usually inaccessible to psychotherapy… it affects men predominantly… it can shade into schizophrenia… in its mild form it is often erroneously diagnosed as anxiety neurosis or hysteria.\" This description neatly condenses our findings on patients with pruritus ani. It should perhaps be added that in the clinical example given by Gillespie of hypochondria there was, besides intestinal symptoms of \"a bizarre nature\" and \"persecutory ideas of a peculiar kind referring to his gullet and genital organs, \" also \"a tearing away at the anus.\"",

The hallmark of this clinically diagnosed condition is the presence of a rapidly progressive, often fluctuating, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) over a period of weeks to months. The progression of hearing loss is too rapid to be diagnostic for presbycusis and too slow to conclude a diagnosis of sudden SNHL. Vestibular symptoms, such as generalized imbalance, ataxia, positional vertigo and episodic vertigo may be present in almost 50% of patients. Occasionally only one ear is affected initially, but bilateral hearing loss occurs in most patients, with symmetric or asymmetric audiometric thresholds. Almost 25–50% of patients also have tinnitus and aural fullness, which can fluctuate. Systemic autoimmune diseases coexist in 15–30% of patients.",

      "title": "La Locura Maniaco-Depresiva",
      "abstract": "Estados fundamentales. La locura ma­ niaco-depresiva evoluciona por accesos que sobrevienen, generalmente, al margen de influencias externas. Ello nos conduce a buscar la causa verdadera y profunda de es­ te mal (Leiden) en un estado cronico que persiste incluso fuera de los accesos. Eso resulta sumamente evidente cuando se repi­ ten episodios patologicos frecuentes tras periodos intermedios mas o menos regu­ lares. Pero incluso en aquellos casos que la enfermedad no se manifiesta mas que en al­ gunas ocasiones o una sola vez en la vida, es necesario buscar su raiz en una altera­ cion de la vida animica (Seelenleben) que se ha constituido a lo largo de mucho tiem­ po, o que incluso existe desde la juventud. A primera vista, unicamente parecen cons­ tituir una excepcion los casos en los que el acceso se ha desencadenado por una causa exterior; mas adelante trataremos de mos­ trar por que y en que medida esto solo es una excepcion aparente. Tanto la variabilidad de la frecuencia co­ mo la de los accesos sugieren que la severi­ dad de la alteracion (Veranderung), a la que nosotros consideramos la base de todo el cuadro patologico, oscila entre unos marge­ nes muy amplios. Esto mismo nos ensena el estudio clinico. A lo largo de los tiempos intermedios, la gran mayoria de los enfer­ mos maniaco-depresivos, en especial aque­ llos en los que los accesos son muy raros, no presentan en absoluto ninguna anomalia en relacion al estado de salud, su entorno no se percata casi nunca de algunas particu­ laridades pequenas que, sin llegar a consti­ tuir algo patologico, podrian tener para el experto una cierta relacion con su mal. No obstante, en un gran numero de casos, tanto el profano como el propio enfermo apre­ cian que algunos trastornos muy sutiles del estado general persisten, y que correspon­ den, en la forma de pequenos indices, a las manifestaciones patologicas de la locura maniaco-depresiva (manisch-depressives lrresein). Entre los casi 1.000 casos obser­ vados en Munich, aproximadamente el 37% muestran particularidad cronicas de este genero. A veces, los accesos patologi­ cos claramente individualizados no repre­ sentan otra cosa que la amplificacion de trastornos que han estado presentes a lo lar­ go de toda la vida anterior; por el contrario, ellos muestran lo opuesto solo en contadas ocasiones. Ahora bien, las alteraciones cronicas que hemos mostrado anteriormente, relati­ vas basicamente a singularidades de la vida afectiva, no afectan unicamente a las perso­ nas que sufren accesos maniaco-depresi­ vos. Tal constatacion podria conmover se­ riamente la significacion clinica de dichas alteraciones, de no ser porque la experien­ cia ensena que se las observa de manera particularmente frecuente, bajo la forma de simples particularidades personales, en las familias de enfermos maniaco-depresivos. Incluso aunque no sea siempre asi, dichas relaciones son tan frecuentes que no es po­ sible dudar de su significacion profunda. Todo ello nos conduce a concluir que exis­ ten ciertas constituciones (Veranlagungen) que deben ser consideradas como los pri-",

There is that state during the first year of the child's life in which an object removed from direct perception ceases to exist for the child.<sup>1,2</sup>It is suggested that in the act of denying, the perception of a disagreeable object is actively rejected in the hope that the ancient sequence will be repeated and the object will cease to exist. The ostrich with its head in the sand is the proverbial symbol of denial. Since the denial mechanism stems from a very early developmental stage, it is perhaps not surprising that when frank denial is seen to any appreciable degree in adults, it is in association with serious mental illness.

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of psychotropic medication (see Appendix). In spite of a high prevalence of sexual disorders secondary to psychopharmacological agents, there is a paucity of studies in the medical literature that clearly document the magnitude of the problem. Most reported instances of sexual disorders etiologically related to psychotropic medication are found in case reports and case series. The differential diagnosis of sexual dysfunction includes the sexual disorders associated with mental illness. In order to identify the etiology of sexual dysfunction in a patient with a mental disorder, the clinician must take a careful sexual history during the initial phase of treatment. Most patients do not spontaneously report sexual dysfunction to their therapists during the first session [1]. Decisions about prescribing psychotropic agents without establishing the baseline sexual functioning of a patient may obfuscate the process of differentiating between a sexual dysfunction caused by medication and one preexisting secondary to a mental disorder. Underreporting by patients during the initial interview does not preclude clinicians' exploring data",

The attacks developed before 2 years of age and were as frequent as 50 or more each day. Electroencephalographic recording during seizures revealed a similar pattern in all patients. Tactile stimulation evoked long-latency (60 to 125 msec), brief bursts of widespread, bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical EEG discharges. They occurred before, synchronous with, or after the myoclonus.

      "abstract": "Epileptic seizure is symptom of acute diseases (provoked seizure with known cause) or epilepsy (unprovoked epileptic seizure with no irritated factor). For establishment of seizure type a precise anamnesis is necessary and an EEG (video-polygraphy when awake, during sleep, after deprivation, with photostimulation, hyperventilation). Normal EEG, as well as an abnormal EEG with a positive family history of epilepsy does not confirm epileptic seizure. With clinical evaluation of the first unprovoked or repeated epileptic seizure, the exact classification of seizure, epilepsy or syndrome will be established. A non-provoked epileptic seizure will be repeated in 14-65% children in one year. In children with idiopathic/cryptogenic seizures the risk for repetition is 30-50% and in children with symptomatic cause the risk is higher than 50% in a 2 year period from the unprovoked seizure. About 46% of children followed-up over 10yrs had one or more epileptic seizures after the first unprovoked seizure. According to the literature data, even prolonged seizures rarely cause brain damage in children, except in connection with acute neurological disturbances. One of the reasons for starting antiepileptic therapy (AET) is the fear of injury or death during the next seizure. To lessen the cause of injury, it is necessary to reduce all possible risks during the daytime. Sudden death in children with epilepsy is a rarity and is connected to some kind of neurological damage. There is no study with a description of a lesser risk of injury or sudden death in children with AET introduced after the first unprovoked seizure. According to two studies of class II and four studies of class III according to EB criteria, there is no difference in terms of the chance of repeated seizure in children with AET and those without AET. The decision about introducing AET or not, in children or adolescents after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure should be based on the possibility of repeated epileptic seizures and the danger of permanent AET that can influence the child’s cognitive development, behaviour, physical and psychosocial development. The decision should be evaluated individually for each child taking into account the medical reasons together with the decisions of the patients and family. Recommendations after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure: AET is not indicated for prevention of development of epilepsy (level B); 2. Treatment with AET should be considered as a possibility of preventing the next seizure and the risk of pharmacological and psychosocial side-effects (level B). At first, in a child with the first epileptic seizure, all gathered data, clinical features and findings should be considered together with a detailed clinical evaluation, instead of immediate initiation of AET treatment.",

They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

      "title": "The Male Sexual Pain: Issues and Treatments",
      "abstract": "Objective: There are several kinds of male genital pain which can cause mental suffering. Usually, they emerge during ordinary urological or andrological examinations. These distresses, sine materia, can be divided into different groups. Design and Method: The first group, which is the most frequent one, mainly affects the testicles; usually, this kind of distress last all life and it is often associated with surgery and/or frequent examinations to the genitals during childhood. The second group encompasses cases of real penodinia: the patients express their discomfort especially uncovering the glan and, for this reason, this action is never done. This distress is not always referred to as pain, but more often as bothersome. Sexual intercourses are permitted. Often the patients undergo a circumcision that usually has a complicated postoperative course. The males of the third group correspond to the women suffering from vaginismus. The patients do not even tolerate the approach of the hand to the penis and they make the same actions and the same movements as the vaginismic women. The patients are unable to have sex. This phenomenon is rare. In a perspective of multi-disciplinary and integrated methodology, the patients were treated with traditional surgery and/or with administration of drugs and/or with sexual therapy according with the integrated Kaplan method and/or with techniques for the rehabilitation of the pelvic floor. Results: Some clinical cases will be presented and discussed. Conclusions: The Authors describe new categories of male genital pain, never defined before, similar to Vulvodynia or Vaginism in women.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive synchronous neuronal activity of the brain.” The word seizure is of Greek origin, the root word being “seiein” which means “to shake”. “Epilepsy is a disease of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures.” It is also characterized by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the\r\ncondition. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the three:\r\n1. Two or more unprovoked seizures which occurs >24 h apart.\r\n2. One unprovoked seizure and a chance of occurrence of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years.\r\n3. Diagnosis of an electro clinical syndrome.\r\nEpilepsy is said to be resolved in those children who had an age specific epilepsy syndrome but now have crossed that age group or children who have been seizure-free for the past ten years, with no antiepileptics for the past five years.\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\nThe aim of the study was to identify the pattern of abnormalities in MRI and EEG in developmentally normal children presenting with new onset seizures.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe study was a prospective observational study conducted in our hospital, Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children for a period of six months. The study included children who presented with new onset seizures in the age group 2 months to 12 years. Children with simple febrile seizures, acute CNS infection, trauma, toxin, metabolic seizures, chronic neurological illness were excluded. All the children underwent complete neurological examination, MRI brain and EEG.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe study included 100 children from 2months to 12 years. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common age group of children presenting new onset seizures was 6 to 12 years, mean age being 5.4 years. The commonest seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Eleven percent of the children presented with status epilepticus as the first episode of new onset seizures. MRI abnormalities were seen in 29% of the children most common finding being Ring enhancing lesion(65.5%). EEG abnormalities were seen in 38% of the children, commonest abnormality being generalized spikes(63.2%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nRing enhancing lesion is the most common abnormality in neuroimaging detected in children presenting with new onset seizures. Generalized epileptiform activity is the commonest EEG abnormality noted in children with new onset seizures.",

Psychiatric examination concluded that the individual was feigning amnesia. Claimed amnesia of a criminal offense is one of the most commonly feigned symptoms in the forensic medical setting. It is thus necessary to rule out organic or psychogenic causes of amnesia and always consider feigned amnesia in the presence of psychopathological alterations that do not reflect classically known syndromes.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Anticipation of these situations is also experienced with uneasiness, distress or fear. The course of SP is that of a chronic, unremitting lifelong disease and secondary complications such as depression, substance abuse (alcohol or tranquillisers) and suicide attempts may be associated with it, thus making the disorder severely disabling.

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive. Specify if: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.",

      "title": "Conversion and Somatization in Pediatrics",
      "abstract": "Although conversion disorder rarely is diagnosed formally in ordinary pediatric practice, busy pediatricians often do encounter the phenomenon of conversion. Conversion is the experiencing of unacceptable emotional conflicts as symptoms, usually but not always physical, rather than as mental events. Conversion is commonplace, affecting almost all body systems. It must be recognized and managed appropriately early in its course, lest inappropriate evaluations and treatments occur; in addition to their other costs, such unnecessary procedures may introduce the child inadvertently to such symptomatization as a life-long pattern of behavior. More than a century ago, Briquet recognized that at least 50% of adult \"professional patients\" begin their symptomatic careers before puberty; thus, inappropriate care of the young patient who has conversion symptoms may have serious, long-lasting consequences. Problems in Diagnosing Conversion The traditional diagnostic elements of conversion often are difficult to demonstrate in pediatric practice. Almost all are either not specific to conversion or hard to confirm in young patients for reasons of developmental immaturity. These \"standard\" elements include the following: • Stress or conflict preceding symptoms (true of many illnesses) • Unconscious symptom production outside the patient's awareness (thus often inaccessible to the pediatrician) • A model for the symptom (either unverifiable or prone to observer bias) • Primary gain or relief of underlying conflict (again, difficult to confirm)",

      "title": "The 'Pre-Prodromal' or ‘Pre-Premonitory’ Phase Holds the key to the Cause-Effect Basis of Migraine Buried over 25 Centuries: Continuum of the Confusion surrounding Allodynia-Randomized Controlled Trials-Stress-Intraocular Pressure-Migraine Nexus",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a protean recurrent cephalalgogenic neuro-ophthalmologic disorder caused by an ‘autonomic storm’ (AS) associated external-carotid arterial system linked selective / exclusive aberration of the peripheral division of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) with lateralizing headache, non-homonymous visual field defects including scintillating scotoma (SS) and other forms of visual / non-visual hallucinations, and unpleasant autonomic nervous system (ANS) symptoms such as nausea / vomiting well-known over 25 centuries, since the intuitive observation of Hippocrates (c. 460-c.370 B.C.). The functional connectome of migraine that affects almost one-fifth of humankind has become an increasingly complex neuro-ophthalmological-endocrinological mystery, constituting a social stigma with exponential increase in statistical but not biologically significant data that form a series of Gordian knots of worsening proportions, both in series and in parallel. Scientific literature of migraine is frustratingly vast, increasingly diverse, and pathophysiologically and clinically disheartening. Recently, pathological (morphological and functional) principles that govern migraine and other primary headaches have been clearly evolved. Migraine is not a pan- or holo-trigeminal disorder, but selectively or exclusively involves aberration of the oculo-peripheral components of the first division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). “Trigeminovascular system” is a misleading term that obscures the overriding clinic-pathological importance of peripheral computations of the oculo-trigeminal system, including V1, oculo-sympathetico-intraocular pressure and sclero-corneal systems. Overemphasis on different symptomatic phases of migraine, absolutely without any neurophysiologic scientific basis or a pivotal systematic structuring of the scattered diversely expanding evidences into a robust, generalizable, predictable, logical, defensible, and constantly enlarging overview has worsened the cause-effect conundrum. Division of a common entity such as migraine into pathophysiologically-incomprehensible apparently distinct phases such as the prodrome / premonitory, aura, headache, and postdrome intervals does not allow for a seamless, comprehensive and gestaltic synthesis. ‘Ictal’ (attack) and ‘interictal’ (between attack) phases complete the presumed circle of migraine, with an erroneous or pseudo-link with epilepsy that extends to both theory and therapy. Lateralizing V1 headache (unilateral, bilateral, side-shifting, or side-fixed) is the most consistent phase of migraine while aura (SS / other hallucinations) is the most varied and inconsistent phenomenon, creating and sustaining the debatable entities, migraine with aura (MwA) and migraine without aura (MwoA). Non-homonymous nasal-visual field sparing digitally-displaceable and ocular movement-synchronous SS is the pathognomonic visual feature of MwA, the typical expression of which requires a normally-functional eye. The origin of migraine lies in the pathophysiologic aberrations of the asymptomatic or subclinical currently unlabeled ‘pre-prodromal’ or ‘pre-premonitory’ phase. Onset of spontaneous / experimental migraine attacks is generally insidious and linked to a threshold that may be primed by a single or multiple triggers. Psychosocial stress is the commonest precipitant of migraine, the pathophysiological mechanism(s) of which remains completely unknown. The psychosocial stress / stressor (overt or subliminal) and other trigger-linked AS that operates in the ‘pre-prodromal / pre-premonitory’ phase covertly generates migraine, with the clinical consequences of the primary ANS aberration, i.e. AS flowing variably into the so-called phases. A conceptual divide between homeostatic / adaptive and pathogenetic physiologic aberrations clarifies both the cause-effect spectrum as well as the typical and hitherto unexplained but characteristically delayed onset of the migraine attack. With increasing understanding of the vasopressin-noradrenaline-serotonin nexus, the vast phenomenology of migraine (central and / or peripheral, episodic or chronic, clinical or pathological) has begun to be clearly categorized either as adaptive or pathogenetic. A hyperfocus on the ‘pre-prodromal’ / ‘pre-premonitory’ phase critically shifts the pathogenesis of spontaneous / experimental, self-limited headache (4-72 hours), and other protean manifestations of migraine attacks (aura-headache) from a pan-trigeminal disorder to V1 as well as to the eye rather than the brain. In 100 years of dedicated research including technological explosion, exponential data expansion, and foundational statistical significances, the prelude of the subliminal AS phase of migraine has not been integrated into any extant brain theory or any generally accepted other phase(s) of migraine. The ‘pre-prodromal’ / ‘pre-premonitory’ phase of AS of migraine is discussed towards a complete evolution of the disorder, including integration of episodic and chronic forms of migraine. A bluish-discoloration of the supero-lateral corneo-scleral envelope is presented as a particularly weakened or susceptible pathophysiologic and functional region of the eye that can generate spontaneous or experimental nociceptive neurologic deformation or activation of V1 to develop sui generis or idiosyncratic but ocular-tamponade self-limited migraine headache attacks (4-72 hours). The higher incidence of migraine in females and decline with age / menopause is also rationalized. The ‘pre-prodromal / pre-premonitory’ phase of migraine is the largest, most unpredictable, attack-initiating patho-functional AS component of migraine. The pathology of migraine and its functional components are thus brought together. A full discussion of the blue-discolouration of the corneo-scleral envelope and its mural components as related to migraine is beyond the scope of this article.",

These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.",

      "abstract": "Out of the two functions constituting male sexual functions, the reproductive and the coital one, the author has made a clinical study on the latter, that is, insufficiency and impotence in the narrow sense, which has hitherto been paid little scientific attention to. The sutudy has been on psychic impotence which accounts for the most part of clinical cases and on endocrine (androgen deficient) impotence which were found conciderable in frequency.(1) The author has defined impotence as the deficiency of one or two factors of sexual pattern, that is, sexual desire, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.(2) The author's causal classification of 130 cases he treated is as follows: -a) organic cause: -penile (malformation or disease) 1.5%: endocrine (pituitary, testicular, or adrenal deficiency) 21.5%: nervous (central or distal motility, or sensory nerve damage) 4.6%. b) functional cause: -psychic (psychological 8 cases, psychic 81 cases which is 62.3%) 68.5%. c) other causes (urological cause by the disease in the urethra, in the accessory sexual glands, or by operation or external injury, diabetes mellitus, chronic consumption, physiological defect) 3. 8%. It is notworthy that out of the urological out-patient the psychic cause accounts for more than 50%.(3) Various psychic causes inhibiting the male sexual pattern were the basic factors, as the authors calls, of psychic impotence and the classification of 89 cases he treated is as follows: -sexual organ inferiority 6 cases, new marital condition 23 cases, abnormal sexual behavior 16 cases, disease anxiety or fear of disease 24 cases, suppression from the wife 3 cases, fear of conception 1 case, subconscious homosexuality 1 case, neurosis sign 8 cases, and unknown 5 cases.(4) The classification by age groups of psychic impotence is as follows: -the young group below 30 years old 45 cases, the prime-of-life group between 30 to 40 years old 18 cases, the more elderly and old age group 26 cases.(5) The author found that there was a characteristic difference between the basic factor of the young-group psychic impotence and that of the elderly-and-old-age-groups psychic impotence. The formation process of psychic impotence was that it originated from the individual's unconscious fear, doubt, anxiety, inhibitory idea about his own sexual function.(6) The treatment of psychic impotence was conducted primarily by psychotherapy through the interview at a regular interval and secondarily by medical therapy as a kind of trigger to cure. This method was sufficient and the most suitable even for a urologist.(7) The author's therapeutic result was that, out of 19 cases of new-marital impotence which is typical of young-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 2 cases unsuccessful, and uncertain of result 7 cases: and that, out of 22 cases of elderly-and-old-age-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 5 cases improved, 7 cases uncertain.(8) Endocrine impotence he treated was 28 cases and the classification of factors were that 17 cases were counted for the upper-central-nervous disorder, out of which 13 cases eunuchoidism: testicular disorders were 11 cases, out of which 8 cases post-pubertal castration, and 3 cases testicular atrophy.(9) The characteristic features of sexual pattern in endocrine impotence were that sexual desire generally declined, erotic erection and reflexible erection were damaged to various degrees, ejaculation decreasing and orgasm weakened.(10) Sexual function of castrate could be maintened and kept under control by supplying him with androgen. The author made investigation on the most efficacious method for it.",

Durante la fase prodromica muchos \npacientes tambien pueden padecer uno o varios de los siguientes sintomas no motores: disfuncion olfatoria, trastorno \nconductual del sueno MOR, depresion, estrenimiento, hipotension ortostatica, somnolencia diurna y disfuncion urinaria \no erectil, entre los cuales los cuatro primeros se han asociado con un mayor riesgo de desarrollar la EP, especialmente si \nse padece mas de uno. Sin embargo, no todos los pacientes con EP reportan haber experimentado alguno de los \nsintomas no motores antes del diagnostico. Estudios futuros permitiran determinar si los sintomas no motores podrian \nusarse para acortar la latencia diagnostica de la EP",

Whereas drug use starts out as controlled, casual use, during the development of the addiction syndrome, drug seeking and taking escalates into a compulsive mode of behavior. This is reflected by the criteria in DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in which five out of seven symptoms signify that control over drug intake has been lost: [Substance dependence is .. . ] a maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three (or more) of the following, occurring at any time in the same 12-month period.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT– Thirty‐seven, out of a sample of 100 elderly subjects, all suffering from dementia, were found to have delusions. The delusions were more common in women, in patients with a history of psychiatric illness, and amongst those with higher information subscores (Blessed Scale); and were less common in patients suffering from apraxia or severe psychosocial incompetence. Amongst the deluded patients the simultaneous presence of disorientation, hallucinations and hyperactivity often signified the diagnosis of delirium, but on follow up it was not correlated with death within 18 months. The same symptoms in the non‐deluded patients were correlated with severe social incompetence and death within 18 months. It is concluded that the presence of delusions in subjects over 75 years old suffering from dementia is related, to certain extent, to previous or concomitant psychiatric illness, and that it reflects a relative preservation of mental function amongst those without such history.",

Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated.

      "abstract": "Introduction We present the first mnemonic method in Portuguese, “RISADA PEGA”, for alarm criteria in emergency headaches in order to facilitate their identification and diagnosis. A search was made through different databases for a mnemonic method regarding alarm criteria in emergency headaches, and methods in English and Spanish were found, but there was no mention of one written in Portuguese. Result With that in mind, the method “RISADA PEGA” (“laughter spreads”, in English) was created: Repentina / (Sudden) I - Início depois dos 50 anos / (onset in a patient older than 50) S - Sinais e/ou sintomas de doenças sistêmicas ou neurológicas / (Signs and/or symptoms of systemic or neurologic diseases) A - Anormalidades no exame neurológico/(abnormalities upon neurologic examination) D - Depressão da imunidade(AIDS, Câncer)/Depressed immunity (HIV or cancer) A - Antecedentes: doenças que podem acometer o SNC; número de vindas ao PShistória familiar de cefaleia)/(Prior conditions: diseases affecting the central nervous system; number of visits to the health center, history of headache in the family) P - Padrão alterado (mudança no padrão anterior da cefaleia)/(change in headache pattern) E - Esforço/exertion) G - Gravidez/(pregnancy) A - Autonomia (sinais autonômicos)/(autonomic signs) Conclusion In the emergency department, an acute headache is a symptom presented by 2%-4% of admitted patients. Secondary headaches are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A need exists for the quick identification of the alarm criteria and a correct stratification of the patient's risk, proper diagnosis and treatment. There are also time constraints in the emergency department. This shows the usefulness of a method for quick identification of the alarm criteria. We believe this is a useful tool for medical education and a clinical aid for clinical practitioners, it may also be a way to educate patients regarding the alarm criteria for emergency headaches.",

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

      "title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder",
      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "title": "Cyclical Premenstrual Psychosis - Sometimes It Is Your Hormones",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Menstrual psychosis is a broad term used to describe a number of disorders characterized by the acute onset of psychotic symptoms with brief duration, complete resolution of symptoms between episodes, with timing related to menses. This entity was first described in the 18th century, with only 27 confirmed cases using strict diagnostic criteria. While research into causation is limited, estrogen withdrawal is thought to precipitate psychotic symptoms. We describe a case of premenstrual psychosis successfully treated with use of transdermal hormonal contraception and extended menstrual cycling. Clinical Case: A 25-year-old non-binary biologic female (they/them/theirs) with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and psychogenic non-epileptiform seizures was referred to endocrinology for evaluation of recurrent psychotic symptoms associated with menses. They endorsed stable mental health symptoms on aripiprazole except during the seven days prior to their menstrual cycle. During this time they reported persistent auditory hallucinations along with dysmenorrhea, with symptoms resolving at the onset of menses. Timing of menarche was uncertain, however they reported oligomenorrhea until beginning oral contraceptives at age nineteen, after which they developed regular monthly cycles accompanied by psychotic symptoms. Pituitary and ovarian hormone levels were unable to be assessed due to hormonal contraception. Prolactin was 8.3 ng/mL (3-30 ng/mL). In order to limit hormonal fluctuations from daily oral contraceptive pills and monthly withdrawal, the decision was made to transition to transdermal norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol patches changed weekly, with extended cycling to allow one menstrual cycle every three months. At follow-up visit nine months later they reported resolution of auditory hallucinations on this regimen, with symptoms recurring only during extreme stress. Conclusions: While the etiology of menstrual psychosis is unclear, described treatments include a combination of neuroleptics and hormonal therapy, including estrogen, progesterone, and GnRH agonists. As symptoms did not resolve until suppression of monthly menstrual cycles, this case supports the estrogen withdrawal hypothesis. Our case adds to the literature both in that transdermal, rather than oral or injectable therapy was used, and treatment was successful in alleviating the patient’s psychotic symptoms, improving their mental health and quality of life.

      "title": "Managing antiepileptic drug, Starting, Changing and Stopping AED’s",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 hours apart, one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years, diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

Chronic pelvic pain can be visceral, somatic, neuropathic, or a combination. Patients with CPP often suffer from concurrent bowel or bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, depression, and anxiety. The complexity of chronic pelvic pain can be challenging to treat, which can lead to frustration for both patients and their physicians.

      "title": "Vulnerability to addictive behaviors: the Associational Memory‐Appetitive Systems Relations Model",
      "abstract": "The concept of behavioral addictions invites controversy, but is slowly penetrating psychiatric consensus. Any addiction involves five components1: a) existence of appetitive needs and b) repeated attempts at satiation of these needs through ingestion of a substance or engagement in a behavior (appetitive effects), followed at some point by c) preoccupation with obtaining appetitive effects (e.g., craving, tolerance), d) loss of control over time spent engaged in appetitive effect-related behavior (e.g., duration, relapse), and e) undesired or negative consequences (such as failure to meet work, familial and social obligations; suffering physical injury; emotional turmoil) resulting from continued engagement in the behavior2. The fundamental underlying perspective is that addiction involves disruption of appetitive functioning; that is, of behavior directed towards fulfilling specific human psycho-socio-biological needs3. It has been theorized that addictive phenomena operate through appetitive mechanisms involving, in part, a misleading, temporary subjective sense of neurobiological fitness4, 5. This experience may be identified through subjective changes in a) affect (e.g., feelings of joy, or merely improvement of affect), b) level of arousal (e.g., alertness or sedation/calm), or c) cognition (e.g., clarity, enlightenment, or decrease in tempo of stream of thought). One may learn to associate in memory the appetitive need (internal cue) with the contexts (location, time of day, situation) and behavior (e.g., sex, work) that led to its temporary subjective satiation, even though the result may not actually be biologically adaptive. The Associational Memory-Appetitive Systems Relations Model of addiction describes how appetitive motives may become excessive, atypically elicited, or misdirected5. There are four main components of this model. First, it is acknowledged that addictions (e.g., alcohol use) have a substantial genetic component (e.g., between 10 and 50% is accounted for by genetics). The model theorizes that one's appetitive needs are impacted by one's genetics. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to substance or behavioral addictions may have a different physiological reaction when engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., involving valence of subjective reward, dissociation of wanting and liking, or involvement of counteradaptation processes). The neurochemistry of an individual can potentially create an inclination toward maladaptive appetitive functioning. DNA epigenetic processes such as cytosine methylation may impact gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (part of an appetitive motivation pathway) subsequent to initial recreational drug intake and possibly involvement in other addictive behaviors. Prolonged periods of stress, particularly at a young age (adverse childhood experiences), may lead to disruption in brain reward cascade functioning. Such disruption, in turn, may increase one's vulnerability to addictive behavioral rewards. Second, the social and physical environmental settings that one traverses will impact what information one learns and how one thinks, and may facilitate which behaviors one may select to perform. Daily life social \"pushes\" (stresses, social influence) and \"pulls\" (seductions) provide possible avenues of addiction. For example, encouragement by peers to engage in drug use or marketing the \"excitement\" of local casinos may push or pull one to explore an addictive substance or behavior. Production and distribution routes of various addictive behaviors will impact what is available to the potential \"consumer\". Accessibility and awareness of nearby addictive behavior will impact which behaviors one will initiate. Third, one's lifestyle inputs also impact what behaviors may \"pop\" to mind in daily life. A child who grows up with parents who were engaged in addictive behaviors may be relatively likely to tie appetitive needs fulfillment to an addiction-related lifestyle through vicarious learning3, or else be quite wary to fall victim to such a behavior pattern. In addition, through vicarious experiences, one may learn the vocabulary associated with an addictive behavior (e.g., cannabis \"head high\" versus a \"body high\"). That is, one may be socialized and prepared at a young age for entrée into involvement with an addictive behavior later on. When one contemplates trial of an addictive behavior, it should be mentioned that acquisition skills are needed to be able to engage in the behavior with minimal conflict. This includes behavior-specific conversation initiation skills (i.e., knowing how to meet a \"supplier\" and acquire the addictive behavior; for example, arranging a purchase of cocaine, or time with a sex worker) and a means of exchange (e.g., money or favors for drugs). Involvement in different addictions may vary over the course of human development. For example, persons as young as three years of age may suffer from television addiction. Persons as young as eight years of age may become addicted to caffeine. There are many behaviors that could be experienced as appetitive and become addictive (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and other drug misuse; binge overeating/food addiction; shopping; electronic media-related; love and sex; workaholism; exercise; and gambling)3. A large minority or a majority of people have tried at least once engaging in various addictive behaviors (e.g., overeating, alcohol use, overspending). More-than-initial trial of an addictive behavior is partly a function of attraction to that behavior. Attraction-related variables include the social image associated with the behavior (e.g., mentioned in the recovery movement, of being \"hip, slick and cool\"), what one's peers are engaged in (peer social influence), as well neurobiological effects of engaging in the behavior. Fourth, it is through the process of associative learning that appetitive needs come to be subjectively satiated through adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Associative learning and memory have been considered in several recent models of addictive behaviors. Cues in an environment that otherwise would be considered innocuous can stand out to be emotionally salient when influenced by motivational states6. These cues can range from eating behavior being triggered when seeing fast food sign cues or eating locations, or a drug user becoming excited or agitated when in sight of his/her drug of choice. Some individuals may not, through deliberate cognition, recognize that their decisional processes are being influenced by maladaptive or extreme reward cues. It has been proposed7 that appetitive motivation is controlled through a dual process of deliberate, conscious, executive, regulatory cognition interacting with relatively automatic, implicit processes, in response to addiction-related cues. Over time, in part due to relatively automatic prompting by multiple cues, one may experience excessive thoughts about and desire to perform a behavior. In turn, excessive time may be spent to plan and engage in the behavior, and possibly recover from its effects (e.g., from \"hangovers\"), and less time may be spent on other activities, despite diminishing appetitive effects1, 8. One is most vulnerable to initial and continued trial of an addictive behavior if the initial consequences are experienced as \"filling the gap\" in one's sense of well-being (i.e., of being satiated, fulfilled). A widely used saying within the recovery movement is that at first the addiction \"does something for the person\" and then it \"does something to the person\". In conclusion, appetitive needs are instinctually embodied in every human being from birth. For at least the past one hundred years, researchers have been exploring the parameters of appetitive needs in human beings9. The interface between one's genetics, social and physical environmental cues, lifestyle situations, development and adaptation (epigenetics and associative learning), and associative memory, may underlie addictive behavior. There is a lot to be learned from an appetitive needs perspective on what is at the root of an addictive process. Appetitive needs which might be explored include those of dominance/leadership, respect, being part of a herd, providing nurturance or being nurtured, and obtaining pleasure3, 5. More research is needed to explore a taxonomy of appetitive needs, and how different appetitive needs act as sources of vulnerability factors and may transform into specific addictive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infertility is a reproductive system condition defined by the failure to carry a clinical pregnancy following a period of 12 months or more of unprotected regular intercourse. Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

Surgical intervention to decompress affected organs or area of the body is often the only effective treatment, although evidences to assess the best timing of intervention are lacking. Present paper systematically reviewed the literature stratifying timings according to the compartmental syndromes which may beneficiate from immediate, early, delayed, or prophylactic surgical decompression. Timing of decompression have been stratified into four categories: (1) immediate decompression for those compartmental syndromes whose missed therapy would rapidly lead to patient death or extreme disability, (2) early decompression with the time burden of 3–12 h and in any case before clinical signs of irreversible deterioration, (3) delayed decompression identified with decompression performed after 12 h or after signs of clinical deterioration has occurred, and (4) prophylactic decompression in those situations where high incidence of compartment syndrome is expected after a specific causative event.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

In this study, 50 violent offenders were interviewed with neuropsychological and psychometric measures, to determine the factors that underlie amnesia and the recovery of memory in these cases. The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

At 3 months of age, the normal infant holds the head steady when held upright by the physician. Failure to hold the head up usually indicates poor motor development. Head nodding may be normal, but it is usually seen in children who have emotional issues or are mentally retarded or who have spasmusnutans. Note the amount, color, and texture of the hair. The newborn infant usually has hair that is fully replaced beginning at about 3 months of age, though substantial new hair growth may not be observed until 9 – 24 months. Lack of hair (alopecia) may be a familial characteristic or a manifestation of ectodermal dysplasia, hyperthyroidism, or progeria. Localized alopecia (alopecia areata) is seen in ringworm or other infections of the scalp and in acrodynia, but in infants it is most commonly caused by rubbing of localized areas when the infant lies in one position for a long time. Rarely, alopecia areata is seen in children with syphilis or hypervitaminosis A or in children who pull out the hair or occurs after severe systemic disease (e.g., typhoid fever).",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Abuso sexual infantil: desafío multidisciplinar. Un abordaje integral del problema para mejorar su detección y la atención a la víctima",
      "abstract": "espanolEl abuso sexual infantil (ASI) es el delito de malos tratos a menores que mas sumergida y silenciosamente ocurre ante la sociedad, por lo que en un alto porcentaje queda impune. Las secuelas que origina en la psicologia de la victima son profundas y prolongadas, y a menudo resultan devastadoras para su biografia posterior, hecho que solo puede ser evitado si el abuso es detectado y se brinda al menor una adecuada rehabilitacion psicoemocional. La mejora en su deteccion y abordaje profesional es una responsabilidad que recae, entre otros servidores publicos, sobre el pediatra. Pero el analisis objetivo de este problema pone de manifiesto que las formas mas comunes de presentacion clinica del ASI ante el pediatra son las cripticas, sobre todo en forma de trastornos comportamentales o de somatizaciones neuroticas de la victima, a priori inespecificas, por efecto del desbordamiento emocional debido al padecimiento silencioso y a la vivencia solitaria de desamparo, en la mayoria de los casos, sin mediar revelacion alguna por parte de aquella ni hallar pruebas fisicas en su exploracion. Ante este hecho, y partiendo solo de una mera sospecha o posibilidad intuida, el pediatra se enfrenta a un autentico desafio en su deber de deteccion, asistencia, notificacion y custodia a la victima. El presente trabajo tiene por objetivo ayudar al pediatra a orientar correctamente su actuacion al afrontar este desafio. Se expone para ello el resultado de un analisis integral del problema, en el que han sido abordados no solo aspectos de la presentacion clinica y la actuacion medica a recomendar, sino tambien de la fenomenologia social y familiar del ASI y del devenir judicial y biografico de los casos, con el fin de orientar mejor la actuacion pediatrica. Esta, que debe tener como objetivo prioritario la proteccion y rehabilitacion emocional del menor, pero intentando minimizar al maximo las posibles repercusiones psicosociales en la victima y su familia, no halla su unica solucion en el aumento de formacion y concienciacion pediatricas, sino que exige la habilitacion de recursos especializados y multidisciplinares, agiles, discretos y capaces de asumir un seguimiento coordinado a largo plazo, lamentablemente aun no disponibles en muchas comunidades de nuestro pais. Este tipo de seguimiento multidisciplinar y coordinado, necesario tambien para otras formas de sospecha de maltrato y patologias de indole psicosocial, es justificacion suficiente para reivindicar la creacion de Unidades de Pediatria Psicosocial. EnglishChild Sexual Abuse (CSA) is the crime of child abuse that occurs so stealthily and is so submerged in society that it often goes unpunished. The psychological sequels for the victim are both deep and prolonged and can lead to devastating effects on the child's future which can only be prevented if the abuse is detected and appropriate psychoemotional rehabilitation rovided. The improvement of its detection and victim treatment is a professional sponsibility that lies on the pediatrician, along with other public servants. However, an objective analysis of this issue makes it evident that most common forms of clinical presentation of CSA to the paediatrician are cryptic and usually present themselves as behavioral disorders or neurotic somatization of the victim, a priori unspecified, as consequence of the emotional overflow caused by suffering in silence and solitary experience of helplessness, in the majority of cases, without any disclosure on the victim's part or the finding of any physical evidence after our exploration. Given this fact, the pediatrician is faced with the challenging task of detecting, assisting, reporting and taking care of the victim on the basis of mere suspicion or intuition. The present work aims to help the pediatrician to correctly guide their actions to meet this challenge. A comprehensive analysis of the problem is carried out, addressing not only aspects of the clinical and medical action to recommend, but also the social and family phenomenology of CSA and the legal and biographical becoming of cases, in order to target the pediatric performance. This, it must have as a priority the child's emotional protection and rehabilitation, but trying to minimize the maximum the possible sychosocial impact on the victim and his family. To achieve this it's not the only solution in increasing pediatric training and awareness, but requires the empowerment of specialized resources for a multidisciplinary assessment which has to be prompt, discreet and capable of providing long-term follow up, not yet available in many communities in our country. The need for this multidisciplinary and coordinated monitoring, which is also required in other types of abuse and psycho-social pathologies, is reason enough to vindicate the creation of Pediatric Psycho-Social Units.",

One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

Examples of such events include military combat, violent personal attack, natural or humanmade disasters, and torture. For children, sexually traumatic events may include ageinappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury (American Psychiatric Association. and American Psychiatric Association.

      "title": "Invited Review: Developmental plasticity in respiratory control",
      "abstract": "Development of the mammalian respiratory control system begins early in gestation and does not achieve mature form until weeks or months after birth. A relatively long gestation and period of postnatal maturation allows for prolonged pre- and postnatal interactions with the environment, including experiences such as episodic or chronic hypoxia, hyperoxia, and drug or toxin exposures. Developmental plasticity occurs when such experiences, during critical periods of maturation, result in long-term alterations in the structure or function of the respiratory control neural network. A critical period is a time window during development devoted to structural and/or functional shaping of the neural systems subserving respiratory control. Experience during the critical period can disrupt and alter developmental trajectory, whereas the same experience before or after has little or no effect. One of the clearest examples to date is blunting of the adult ventilatory response to acute hypoxia challenge by early postnatal hyperoxia exposure in the newborn. Developmental plasticity in neural respiratory control development can occur at multiple sites during formation of brain stem neuronal networks and chemoafferent pathways, at multiple times during development, by multiple mechanisms. Past concepts of respiratory control system maturation as rigidly predetermined by a genetic blueprint have now yielded to a different view in which extremely complex interactions between genes, transcriptional factors, growth factors, and other gene products shape the respiratory control system, and experience plays a key role in guiding normal respiratory control development. Early-life experiences may also lead to maladaptive changes in respiratory control. Pathological conditions as well as normal phenotypic diversity in mature respiratory control may have their roots, at least in part, in developmental plasticity.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

Closely related derivatives of asphyxiophilic sex are anesthesiophilia (inhalation of variable volatile substances) and electrophilia (use of electric current during sexual activity)--both also intended to enhance the sexual stimulation.

Primary NE (PNE) is diagnosed in an individual who has never achieved nighttime dryness; in secondary NE (SNE), incontinence follows a dry period of at least 6 months. In either, the enuresis must not be due exclusively to a medical condition or diuretic therapy. Prevalence is estimated at 5% to 10% among 5-year-olds, 3% to 5% among 10-year-olds, and 1% among those 15 years of age and older. Between 5% and 10% of cases resolve annually without treatment.

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

      "title": "SP31 Persistent headache in the parturient: PDPH or something more sinister?",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Unintentional dural puncture followed by postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is a well-known complication of neuraxial labor analgesia/anesthesia. The resulting headache is a dull throbbing pain which occurs within five days of a lumbar puncture and is usually orthostatic in nature, since it tends to worsen when the patient assumes the standing or sitting position and improves when the patient lies down. Associated signs and symptoms such as neck pain or stiffness, photophobia, tinnitus, hypoacusis and nausea are present in more than 50% of cases. The headache is usually self-limiting within two weeks of onset, while resolution can occur sooner if autologous epidural blood patch is performed. PDPH is very unpleasant to new mothers since it severely limits the interaction between the mother and the newborn, while it can lead to prolonged hospitalization and emergency department visits or rarely result in significant morbidity. The pathophysiology behind the development of PDPH is firstly cerebrospinal fluid leakage through the dural puncture, which can lead to stimulation and stretching of sensory cranial nerve fibers caused by downward shift of the brain and secondly intracranial hypotension which leads to cerebral vasodilation and a vascular-type headache, as a compensatory mechanism to maintain the intracranial volume according to the Monro-Kellie doctrine. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation (orthostatic headache after a neuraxial procedure) and can be significantly aided by MRI, which reveals signs consistent with intracranial hypotension, such as compression of the ventricles, reduction of the basal cisterns, caudal displacement of the brain, brainstem and optic chiasm, occasional subdural effusions and cerebellar ectopia. The characteristic MRI sign is the diffuse meningeal thickening and enhancement. The differential diagnosis of PDPH ranges from benign conditions, such as tension-type headache and migraine to serious disorders such as preeclampsia, subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Serious complications of untreated PDPH can occasionally occur. Subdural hematoma is due to traction and compensatory vasodilation of bridging veins due to loss of cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is caused by cerebral venous dilation and blood stasis due to the leak and damage to the cerebral venous en­dothelium caused by the negative spinal-cranial pressure gra­dient in combination with the puerperium hypercoagulability. Both complications can have a deleterious outcome if unsuspected and untreated and difficulties in differential diagnosis arise from the fact that both subdural hematoma and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis present with headache as the commonest symptom, which can lead to considerable delays in diagnosis if accidental dural puncture has simultaneously occurred or is suspected. Therefore, there is a need for urgent neurological consultation as well as urgent neuroimaging in the puerperium in case of new or recurrent neurological symptoms. Both disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in case of atypical clinical presentation or in case of loss of the postural component of the headache during follow-up. Furthermore, it is crucial to investigate persistent or recurrent headaches in the puerperium even after the performance of an epidural blood patch in case of focal neurological signs or in case of severe non-positional headache. <h3>References</h3> Bleeker CP, et al.

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

      "abstract": "Acute telogen effluvium refers to sudden onset of scalp hair loss occurring 2 to 3 months after a triggering event such as a high fever, surgical trauma, sudden starvation, or hemorrhage. While emotional stress is often linked to this condition, evidence supporting this connection is weak, and there is no indication that the stress of daily life alone can cause widespread hair loss. The primary mechanism behind hair loss is the immediate release of anagen hairs. Patients may notice increased hair loss during brushing, combing, or shampooing, with daily losses ranging from under 100 to over 1,000 strands. If shedding occurs at lower rates and for a short duration, baldness may not be apparent, but higher rates can lead to a diffuse reduction in hair density. Spontaneous and complete regrowth typically occurs within 3 to 6 months unless the triggering event is repeated. Abrupt-onset telogen effluvium is often linked to a specific event or trigger 6 to 16 weeks earlier. In acute telogen effluvium, the hair pull test is positive, with normal club hairs, and there is usually a strong positive presence of telogen hairs at the vertex and the scalp margins.[1]",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "title": "Tremor‐Predominant Fragile X‐Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome in a Female",
      "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects fragile X (FMR1) gene premutation carriers in late life (an abnormally large allele that is not associated with clinical symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, but can expand into full mutation when transmitted to offspring). The prevalence in male carriers over 50 years is approximately 40%.1 In female carriers (approximately 1 in 260), the prevalence has not been as extensively studied, but may be as low as 8% over age 40.2 We present the case of a 65-year-old female with a 6-year history of bilateral hand tremor. The symptoms slowly progressed. Currently, she has tremor when holding a cup and has mild tremor when writing. She has no other issues with activities of daily living. She has no cognitive complaints, loss of dexterity or coordination, or other tremor localizations. In addition, she describes long-standing unsteadiness when walking. On physical examination, she has bilateral mild postural and moderate intention tremor of both arms. Mild tremor at rest in her left hand is also observed. Tone, power, and reflexes are normal. She has no limb ataxia, rigidity, or bradykinesia. During walking, she has mild reduced arm swing and her tandem gait is slightly unsteady. Her brain MRI shows mild atrophy, predominantly in the cerebellum, with no evidence of middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) sign or corpus callosum splenium hyperintensity. Her father had arm tremor for many years. Her son has Fragile X syndrome. The patient has an FMR1 premutation (97 repeats), and her symptoms are compatible with FXTAS. Since the original description of FXTAS, there have been many reports and series describing phenotypic differences between males and females. In males, FXTAS is usually characterized by progressive tremor and gait ataxia. Other common features are parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, and depression. Cognitive decline is a highly prevalent and disabling symptom. Brain MRI usually shows atrophy of the cerebrum, cerebellar cortex, corpus callosum and pons, and white matter increased T2 signal intensity. The MCP sign (middle cerebellar peduncles hyperintense signal in T2) is observed in approximately 60% of the cases.1, 2, 4 In contrast, in females with FXTAS, tremor is rarely the initial presentation and is usually a later feature (prevalence of tremor range: 12%–75%) and ataxia is typically milder than in males. As in males, the neurophysiological characteristics of tremor in women with FXTAS have not been well studied. In addition, there are few detailed descriptions of the clinical features of tremor in FXTAS. Parkinsonism can be prominent as the disease progresses. Cognitive impairment is less commonly reported and leads to minor disability. Depression is a common feature (approximately 40%), and, interestingly, it was suggested that women with FXTAS show predisposition to psychogenic disorders. In female premutation carriers, primary ovarian dysfunction (20%), sensory loss (45%), chronic pain (26%), thyroid disorders (50%), and fibromyalgia are also common features. MRI studies showed MCP in only 13% of females.1-5 In our patient, the clinical presentation with a slowly progressive intention tremor and mild gait disturbance could potentially lead to the misdiagnosis of essential tremor. The early development of mild ataxia (rather than later onset that may be more common in essential tremor) was a clue to the diagnosis. In her case, the family history of Fragile X syndrome also clearly oriented the diagnosis; however, FXTAS should also be considered in the absence of a family history of mental retardation, autism, or learning disorders.

Se trata de supuestos en los que el sujeto exterioriza una conducta agitada y confusa, soliendo protagonizar alteraciones del orden publico o de la seguridad ciudadana en los que han de intervenir las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad, que concluyen con la necesidad de reduccion e inmovilizacion del sujeto, debiendo de recurrir para ello al uso de la fuerza. La mayor parte de los casos concluyen de manera satisfactoria, es decir, se logra el fin perseguido y su traslado al centro sanitario, donde recibe la adecuada asistencia. Sin embargo, en un porcentaje no determinado de ellos, culmina con la muerte del sujeto sin que existan hallazgos objetivos postmortem que determinen una etiologia definida, por lo que se inscriben como muertes sujetas a autopsia judicial. En estos casos, puesto que ha existido una accion directa de uso de la fuerza o la detencion por parte de los agentes policiales, la dinamica de su actuacion se convierte en verdadero elemento decisorio de cara a su responsabilidad en un ulterior proceso judicial. EnglishThere is a phenomenon, not well known, with the coexistence of circumstances likely to end in deaths that appear to be “inexplicable”, from a forensic perspective. These are cases where the subject externalizes an agitated and confused behavior, starring in events must intervene and the police must be subjected to physical reduc- tion by the latter. Most of the cases concluded successfully, that is, the purpose intended and moving to the clinic, where she receives appropriate care is achieved. However, in an undetermined percentage of them, culminating in the death of the subject without any objective findings postmortem to determine a definite etiology, so register as deaths subject to judicial autopsy. In these cases, since there has been direct action of use of force by police officers, the dynamics of their performance becomes real decisive element face their responsibility in a subsequent trial.",

En la epilepsia catamenial, su patron de ocurrencia de CE es predecible y ciclico (75%); probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales del periodo menstrual, observandose acentuacion de las CE en los 2 a 3 dias previos a la misma, y con el primer y segundo dias de sangrado menstrual. Metodologia: realizamos una investigacion tipo clinico experimental prospectivo con grupo control, sobre la evolucion clinica de 11 pacientes que presentaban EA con patron ciclico de los cuales 6 recibieron terapia intermitente profilactica con midazolam y 5 pacientes intermitente de ataque con midazolam durante 8 meses. Resultados: Disminucion en la frecuencia de CE en acumulos, mayor al 50% en quienes recibieron tratamiento profilactico con MDZ; contrario a las pacientes con tratamiento de ataque con MDZ, quienes no modificaron la frecuencia de su EA. Conclusiones: El MDZ surge como terapia profilactica eficaz en el control de la epilepsia catamenial en acumulos. El midazolam se plantea como alternativa eficaz para el manejo de EA; planteandose que su utilizacion por V.O, ofrece facil administracion y seguridad.",

The onset is insidious and gradual, although the patient, usually a woman, may associate its beginning with some unusual dietary event, as a party, or indulgence above the ordinary in unusual foods. This event, however, should it occur, usually marks a culmination rather than a commencement. The several typical symptoms, which, let it be emphasized again, are quantitative rather than qualitative, are: (1) constipation; (2) fatigue, which is manifested by a marked disproportion between the mental desire for accomplishment and the physical inability of realization; (3) meteorism; (4) precordial or",

      "abstract": "Muscle cramp is characterized by involuntary, painful, visible contraction of a muscle (or a part of muscle) and is always associated with irregular repetitive firing of motor unit action potentials (200 à 300 Hz) which is caused by hyperexcitability of intramuscular terminal motor axons. It's a common condition in normal people, but most commonly in young people (pregnancy, exercise) and more in the elderly (50% after 65 years-old). A careful history and examination should allow the physician to determine the significance of cramp. ENMG and biological tests are needed in cases of severe symptoms (severity and frequency of cramps) and/or abnormal examination. Idiopathic and secondary (drug or metabolic disorders) cramps are the most common groups, but it's very important to search the motor unit diseases (neuropathy, radiculopathy, plexopathy, neuromyotonia, and a cramp fasciculation syndrome which can preceded ALS). The first goal in management of cramp is to determine if there is an underlying cause and the second to use physical measures (stretching), because, pharmacologic treatments have a moderate interest because of the potential of toxicity (quinine sulfate) or a little effectiveness (vitamin B complex, naftidrofuryl, and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem, gabapentin). Isolated cramp doesn't need treatment.",

Gejala non motorik PP diantaranya adalah gangguan neuropsikiatri seperti depresi, psikosis, ansietas. Kami melaporkan sebuah kasus PP dengan gejala psikotik berupa halusinasi yang jarang dijumpai. Laporan Kasus: Pasien perempuan berusia 74 tahun terdiagnosis Parkinson sejak lebih dari 20 tahun, dibawa ke rumah sakit dengan bicara tidak nyambung, adanya halusinasi visual, dan emosi yang tidak stabil sejak 1 bulan. Keluarga pasien juga merasa sejak 6 bulan terakhir pasien menjadi sering lupa. Pasien dengan riwayat PP tidak rutin mengkonsumsi obat parkinson di bawah supervisi dokter. Keluhan halusinasi pernah dirasakan 2 tahun lalu namun membaik setelah perawatan. Diskusi: Gejala non motorik dapat dijumpai seiring perkembangan penyakit Parkinson dandapat diidentifikasi sebelum sindrom motor muncul. Adanya gejala psikosis berupa halusinasi dalam kasus yang dipaparkan terhadi setelah 18 tahun sejak pasien terdiagnosis, dimana berdasarkan hasil studi terdahulu dilaporkan 60% penderita PP berkembang adanya halusinasi atau delusi setelah 12 tahun perawatan dan pada usia lebih tua saat onset PP. Gangguan kognitif pada PP juga dicurigai dalam kasus walau belum sepenuhnya dapat ditegakan serta adanya gangguan tidur pada PP dengan prevalensi 40-90% dijumpai pada kasus yang kami laporkan. Kesimpulan: Manifestasi non motorik PP yang mencakup gejala neuropsikiatri sangat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup pasien maupun keluarga dan perawat pasien. Klinisi harus meningkatkan kewaspadaan terhadap gejala non motorik PP dan pemberian tatalaksana farmakologi dan non farmakologi harus dilakukan secara terintegratif bersama dengan bidang-bidang terkait sesuai dengan kondisi pasien.

The process of learning about pain starts at birth. The newborn child reacts to painful stimuli, as shown by the response to injections of drugs given under the skin shortly after birth. Newborn babies may, in fact, experience pain during birth when forceps are used, or a bone is damaged. The reaction to pain usually takes place after an interval of about half a second, and the appreciation of pain is slightly longer delayed. Pains caused by stressful situations in children are nearly always located in the abdomen, whereas pains in the joints, or the head, usually have a physical basis. The response to painful stimuli is greatly influenced by upbringing, and the environment, and in some societies the fortitude with which pain is borne is a measure of manhood.",

Increased susceptibility to abnormal psychic reactions and developments after sterilization is to be contemplated with certain personalities with overconscientious, asthenic or depressive traits. It is usually a matter of internal conflict situations at the level of self-esteem which, however, depend not only on the initial personality, but to a large extent are repeatedly reactualized through the behavior and reaction of the persons in the environment, so that finally mental developments arise which reach into the abnormal. This risk must be included in the calculation when making the indication and requires particular attention, because the legal effectiveness of the consent to sterilization is also dependent on the completeness of the advice on the consequences of this surgical operation.",

The attacks are characterized by motor and/or psychic activity which is purposeful but irrelevant for the time and place, and the patient is amnesic afterward for the events that transpired during the seizure. There are no convulsive movements of either tonic or clonic nature during psychomotor seizures. Synonyms for the term psychomotor seizures are epileptic equivalents and epileptic fugue states. Psychomotor seizures occur in late childhood or adult life; they have a frequency approximating that of major convulsions, and the individual attack lasts from one to five or more minutes. On the basis of these clinical facts the differentiation from petit mal epilepsy is not difficult. The activity of the patient during psychomotor seizures is quite distinct. The following examples drawn from the clinical material in this report illustrate the types of activity. A",

      "abstract": "Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare perceptual disorder associated with sensation of one or several visual and/or auditory perceptual distortions including size of body parts, size of external objects, or passage of time (either speeding up or slowing down). Cause for AIWS is yet to be widely agreed, and the implications are widely varied. One of the research difficulties is the brevity of each episode, typically not exceeding few tens of minutes. This article presents a male adult in late 20s who has apparently experienced AIWS episodes since childhood, and infection has been ruled out. Reaction speed tests were conducted during and after AIWS episodes, across a span of 13 months. Statistically significant evidence is present for delayed response time during AIWS episodes when the patient claims to experience a sensation of time distortion: where events seem to move faster and people appear to speak quicker.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli.

      "abstract": "Abstract Women suffering from severe primary dysmenorrhea (PD) show a typical behaviour pattern characterized by flight, avoidance, inactivity and helplessness. The question is if there is a common mechanism of origin in all those individual women who display such PD behaviour. A learning-theoretical model is presented concerning the origin of the connection between the stimulus of menstruation and the response of PD behaviour in women with severe PD: — Women have an increased physiological arousal premenstrually and during menstruation. — Women have a tendency to label the increased arousal negatively for two reasons: (1) Because of negative attitudes towards menstruation acquired from the social environment. (2) Because women have a lack of knowledge about their genitals and their functions, there is a lack of correct labelling of menstruation. Inexplicable arousal is mostly labelled as something “wrong”. — The negatively labelled increased arousal pre- and intermenstrually leads to an increased receptivity for conditioning. — The increased receptivity for conditioning means an increased proneness to react with a specific response to a certain stimulus, i. e. with PD behaviour as a response to the stimulus of menstruation. — Premenstrually highly anxious women are more receptive to conditioning than women who are not anxious premenstrually. The experience of PD makes the woman anticipate menstruation with anxiety, which thus forms the basis of a vicious circle. The validity of this theoretical model needs to be tested in experimental research.",

      "title": "Hallucinations and Delusions",
      "abstract": "Defining terms is an appropriate introduction to this chapter. Hallucinations imply seeing things that are not truly present, or hearing illusory voices or music. In DLB and PDD, hallucinations are nearly always visual and manifest as seeing nonexistent people or objects, such as strangers in the house or yard. The affected individual may realize that he or she is experiencing a hallucination, but some people may not recognize that these are not real. In other disorders auditory hallucinations may be present, such as hearing voices. However, such auditory hallucinations are rare in Lewy disorders. Delusions are defined as false, often irrational beliefs. Frequently, these will have a theme, such as the conviction that someone is spying, or paranoia about friends or neighbors. A common theme is spousal infidelity, sometimes nonsensical, such as an older adult’s accusations of their mate starting an extramarital affair after 50 years of marriage. Capgras syndrome is an uncommon but striking example of delusional thinking in which the spouse or other immediate family member is accused of being an impostor. Hallucinations or delusions may occur in Parkinson’s disease in the absence of frank dementia. However, dementia is the usual setting for these problems. Hallucinations are much more common than delusions. Sometimes they are very limited, perhaps only present at night. Hallucinations are a contraindication to driving a motor vehicle, for obvious reasons. The fundamental cause of hallucinations and delusions in DLB and PDD is the Lewy neurodegenerative process. The precise region of the brain that is responsible is not known, however. These often occur in the absence of any external provocative factors. However, medications are notorious for inciting such problems in susceptible people. Chapter 7 focused on simplifying medications especially for this reason. Drugs for parkinsonism are well-known culprits, in particular two classes: (1) the dopamine agonists: pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and rotigotine (Neupro patch); and (2) anticholinergic drugs: trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin). Carbidopa/levodopa by itself may provoke hallucinations, but that is not very common unless combined with other drugs for parkinsonism.",

      "title": "Aspectos psicológicos y neuropsicológicos de la esclerosis múltiple",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

They are mainly nocturnal and often progress to convulsions. Consciousness is usually impaired from onset or during the ictus. By definition, seizures lasting for more than half an hour are status epilepticus. In one third of these children, the phase of deviation of the eyes with vomiting and impairment of consciousness is prolonged for more than 30 minutes (partial status epilepticus) and usually ends with generalised convulsions. A typical case is of a child who wakes up from sleep agitated, vomiting, eyes deviated to one side, and who may or may not be able to communicate for minutes to hours before hemiconvulsions or generalised convulsions begin. Onset is between 1–12 years, peak is at 5 years, and remission occurs within 1–2 years from onset.

Un examen rapide de la mémoire met en évidence un trouble du rappel qui n’est pas amélioré par les procédures de facilitation (indiçage).

La gêne est essentiellement subjective et le sujet vient seul consulter. L’examen montre une disparition des difficultés de rappel par l’indiçage. Cette plainte, essentiellement corrélée à des phénomènes psychoaffectifs dominés par l’anxiété, une baisse de l’estime de soi et un trouble de l’identité ne constitue pas un risque particulier d’évolution vers la démence.",

      "title": "Late recovery from permanent traumatic vegetative state heralded by event-related potentials",
      "abstract": "A post-traumatic vegetative state that holds for more than 12 months is defined as “permanent”, implying a very low probability of regaining consciousness. Here we report on a patient who emerged from a traumatic vegetative state after 20 months. Beginning from the 6th month, we observed an improvement in the event-related potentials (ERPs) of his brain to complex sensory and verbal stimulation, although the clinical examinations remained unchanged. The possible role of ERPs as predictors of regaining consciousness after a vegetative state is discussed.\n\nThe vegetative state is a most severe neurological syndrome and includes the loss of all kinds of conscious behaviour despite preserved wakefulness.1 In patients with traumatic head injury, a vegetative state that holds for more than 1 year is considered to be “permanent”, which implies irreversibility. In fact, even minimal improvement after this period is extremely improbable. From time to time, however, cases of late emergence are reported,2,3 sometimes even 5 years after the incident.4 The statement “The available data are insufficient to provide a trustworthy estimate of the incidence of late improvement” (Childs and Merger,3 p 24) is still valid; figures varying as broadly as from 1.6% to 14% have been reported.1,3\n\nGiven the rarity of such cases, the slightest hint that such an unexpected improvement may occur would be useful. Here we describe a patient in whom cognitive components of cortical ERPs were consistently obtained for more than 1 year before clinical recovery.\n\nA 28-year-old man was admitted to an intensive care unit with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 after a severe car accident. After 5 days, he regained vigilance but had diminished gaze fixation and could not follow even the simplest commands. Intensive stimulation resulted in generalised flexor responses. Three months …",

      "abstract": "Hospitalizing an adolescent after an acting out is frequent. The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Delusional infestation (DI), also known as delusional parasitosis or Ekbom syndrome, is a rare disorder, characterised by fixed belief that the skin, body or immediate environment is infested by small pathogens, despite the lack of any medical evidence for it. Objectives To describe and discuss two clinical cases of DI, in order to show two different ways of presenting in this entity. Methods Two case report and non-systematic review. Results We present the case of a 76-year-old woman, without psychiatric history, with an DI with 5 years of evolution, referred to a psychiatric consultation by a dermatologist. The second case, is a 41-year-old woman with a history of multiple substance use disorder, with an DI with a month of evolution, who resorted to the emergency department. DI is not a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, as represented in the first case,is a primary form, which develops without any known cause or underlying disease, corresponding to a persistent delusional disorder. However, about 60% of patients have secondary forms of DI, in the context of substance misuse, some medications or in the course of physical or psychiatric diseases (e.g. stroke, delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia). Conclusions DI can occur as a primary delusional disorder or secondary to several other medical conditions. An in-depth clinical history is essential in order to make the correct diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach is also important, to exclude any possible organic etiology, not forgetting that many patients may turn to other medical specialities first.

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

      "title": "Vomiting",
      "abstract": "Vomiting is a generally unpleasant activity that results in the expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth. It is a physical act that has clearly associated gastrointestinal motor activity. Nausea, on the other hand, although frequently accompanying vomiting, is not universally associated with it and does not have an obvious physical mechanism. It is an uncomfortable feeling known to be relieved by vomiting.The ability to vomit presumably conveys a survival advantage by enabling the expulsion of toxins from the stomach. Vomiting occurs after stimulation of either the vomiting center (VC), a central “control center” in the medulla near the respiratory center, or the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema on the floor of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 1). These coordination centers can be stimulated through multiple pathways. Vomiting resulting from psychological stress occurs via pathways traveling through the cerebral cortex and limbic system to the VC. Anticipatory vomiting may be mediated through this mechanism. Vomiting related to motion occurs when the VC is stimulated through the vestibular or vestibulocerebellar system from the labyrinth of the inner ear. Chemical signals from the bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid are detected by the CTZ. This mechanism has been the target of many antiemetic medications. The vagal and visceral nerves are the fourth pathway for stimulation of vomiting via gastrointestinal irritation, distention, and delayed gastric emptying.Once the vomiting centers are stimulated, the cascade of motor events leading to the act of vomiting is the same. Nonperistaltic contractions in the small intestine increase,the gallbladder contracts, and some of the duodenal contents regurgitate into the stomach. This is followed by a large retrograde peristaltic wave that pushes small bowel contents and pancreatobiliary secretions into the stomach and suppresses gastric activity. Meanwhile,the inspiratory muscles contract against a closed glottis, resulting in esophageal dilatation. As the abdominal muscles contract,the stomach contents are forced into the distal esophagus. Relaxation of the abdominal muscles allows the esophageal contents to re-enter the stomach. The cycles of retching quicken until the esophagus no longer empties between cycles, and the contents finally are extruded. The gastrointestinal motor events of vomiting are mediated through vagal and sympathetic efferents from the VC, as are the autonomic events associated with the act of vomiting, namely, increased salivation, increased respiratory and heart rates, and pupillary dilatation.True vomiting can be divided into two broad categories:nonbilious and bilious. Bilious vomiting occurs when bile is purged along with the gastric contents. Although some small intestinal reflux into the stomach is common with all vomiting, in nonbilious vomiting, antegrade intestinal flow is preserved, and the majority of the bile drains into the more distal portions of the intestine. If an obstruction is present,nonbilious vomiting implies that the obstruction is proximal to the ampulla of Vater. Conditions leading to bilious vomiting involve either a disorder of motility or physical blockage to this antegrade flow of proximal intestinal contents distal to the ligament of Treitz.Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), although not true vomiting, frequently is included in discussions of vomiting. In contrast to the mechanism of true vomiting discussed previously, GER occurs as a result of failed normal esophageal function. Normally, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxes with swallowing and propagation of esophageal peristalsis, allowing a food bolus to enter the stomach. Its basal contraction prevents food from re-entering the esophagus from the stomach. Transient relaxation of the LES predisposes to GER and is the major mechanism in infants who have GER. The LES is aided by surrounding structures, especially the crural diaphragm, and disruption of these structures, as with a hiatal hernia, contributes to the GER in some patients. Nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, and some medications can increase relaxation of the LES, contributing to GER in some individuals. GER also is distinguished from true vomiting by its symptoms; the emesis of GER is effortless and generally not associated with retching or autonomic symptoms.Although the causes of vomiting in children are many, a thorough history of the nature of the vomiting and any associated signs or symptoms as well as a complete physical examination generally helps narrow the differential diagnosis (Table 1). Targeted studies help identify the cause of the illness.Acute gastroenteritis is the most common cause of vomiting in children. It is usually associated with diarrhea and abdominal pain, and viruses are common etiologic agents, although bacterial pathogens also must be considered. The most common viral agent in infants is rotavirus. Bacterial pathogens include Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli. Bacterial infections are associated more commonly with bloody diarrhea and high fevers than are viral infections. Enterohemorrhagic E coli 0157:H7 can cause hemorrhagic colitis and may be complicated by the development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Clostridium difficile is a bacterial pathogen that frequently is associated with the recent use of antibiotics. It causes a pseudo-membranous colitis, often with bloody diarrhea and associated with abdominal pain and vomiting. Giardia lamblia is a protozoan commonly associated with contaminated water and attendance at child care centers. It may cause watery diarrhea and vomiting.Diagnosis is made with stool bacterial cultures, rotazyme analysis for rotavirus, detection of C difficile toxin, and detection of ova and parasites for G lamblia. Sepsis,central nervous system infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia all can present with or involve vomiting, usually in addition to other symptoms.Labyrinthitis and pancreatitis both cause vomiting. Dizziness usually is associated with labyrinthitis and abdominal pain with pancreatitis.Inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease, also tend to involve vomiting. In these conditions, the vomiting frequently is related to altered motility with abnormal or dysfunctional swallowing, gastric emptying, or peristalsis.Both inborn errors of metabolism and endocrinologic disorders can cause vomiting (Table 2). The inborn errors of metabolism generally present in early infancy, and the vomiting is associated with symptoms of lethargy, hypo- or hypertonia, seizures, or coma. The constellation of symptoms is similar to that seen in sepsis, necessitating a high index of suspicion in the evaluation of these patients. The presence or absence of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, or ketosis and a family history that includes possible consanguinity can help to determine the diagnosis.One endocrinologic condition associated with vomiting is diabetes mellitus. Vomiting can complicate acute ketoacidosis or occur in patients who have had long-standing diabetes and consequent gastroparesis. Slowed gastric motility usually presents after diabetes mellitus has been present for approximately 10 years. Early satiety and a sense of fullness frequently precede the onset of vomiting in diabetic gastroparesis.Vomiting as a consequence of food-related sensitivity always should be considered. The variants encountered most commonly in pediatric patients are cow milk and soy protein intolerance,type I (IgE-mediated) food allergy, and celiac disease. Cow milk protein intolerance affects 2% to 7% of infants, with approximately 20% of these also sensitive to soy protein. In addition to vomiting, the patients usually have diarrhea that frequently is guaiac-positive. Celiac disease occurs only in children who eat gluten-containing foods. Patients typically suffer from wasting, irritability, and diarrhea, but vomiting also can occur.Vomiting occurs in any neurologic condition that involves increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (Table 3). Additionally, patients who have seizures, autonomic disorders (Riley-Day syndrome), and conditions affecting the floor of the fourth ventricle without increased ICP frequently have their condition worsened with vomiting.Cyclic vomiting is a unique entity that must be considered separately. Onset occurs typically at early school age, and it is characterized by acute-onset periodic episodes of nausea and vomiting interspersed with conspicuous periods of wellness.Approximately 77% of patients can identify precipitating events,usually intense emotional states. These patients have an increased incidence of migraine headaches and prevalence of epilepsy and irritable bowel syndrome. Because no diagnostic test or specific clinical identifying feature distinguishes cyclic vomiting syndrome from other potentially life-threatening conditions, the diagnosis can be made only after time has elapsed and upon exclusion of other diagnoses.Behavioral or psychological causes of vomiting can be problematic in the pediatric age group. Some children induce vomiting to seek attention in environments in which personal attention is lacking. The extreme of this behavior is rumination. Rumination is a serious condition that occurs in infants when there is a failure in reciprocal interaction between the infant and caregiver. The purposes of rumination are self-stimulation and satisfaction of needs. Rumination also is seen in older children, especially those who are severely mentally retarded.Classically, the infant (older than 3 months) learns to bring up gastric contents into the mouth, frequently by inserting a hand into the back of the throat or simply through rhythmic contractions of the pharynx, tongue, and abdominal muscles. The oral contents then are reswallowed, although spillage does occur. Not only do these patients suffer social deprivation, but the chronic emesis can lead to inanition and growth failure. The failure to thrive does not improve with traditional medical intervention, but rather requires sensitive and interactive nurturing. A mother-substitute who is empathic with and observant of both the parent’s and infant’s needs is required to help the parent establish more nurturing skills. More formal psychotherapeutic help frequently is needed for the parents.Bulimia, characterized by secretive binge-eating episodes followed by self-induced vomiting, is a cause of vomiting especially among teenagers.The anatomic and, thus, the generally surgical causes of nonbilious vomiting are those that affect the intestinal tract proximal to the point of bilious drainage (ampulla of Vater), which is proximal to the ligament of Treitz (Table 4). Whereas congenital anomalies usually present in the newborn period, acquired lesions can present at any age. Any infant who exhibits persistent nonbilious vomiting, with or without feeding, in the immediate newborn period must be suspected of having an intestinal atresia or a luminally obstructing lesion(pyloric stenosis, luminal band, web) proximal to the point of bile drainage(ampulla of Vater).An easy and rapid test to evaluate possible esophageal atresia is the ability to pass a nasogastric tube easily into the stomach. After the tube has been passed, it is important to obtain a radiograph to assure that the tube is in the stomach and not coiled in an atretic esophagus. Any resistance to passage of the tube is an indication for evaluation by contrast radiograph for an obstruction. If an obstruction is present, nasoesophageal tube drainage is important to prevent aspiration of pooled esophageal secretions. Contrast studies are the standard for the diagnosis of these conditions (Figs 2–4Figure 2Figure 3– Figure 4AFigure 4B). Although not absolute, anatomic conditions causing luminal obstruction distal to the ligament of Treitz usually cause bilious vomiting. Bilious vomiting is an ominous sign that mandates immediate evaluation(Table 5). In the newborn period, intestinal atresias and stenosis and malrotation with or without volvulus need to be ruled out immediately. In the older child, malrotation with volvulus also is a surgical emergency that is diagnosed relatively easily by gastrointestinal contrast study. After the diagnosis has been established radiographically, the gastrointestinal tract should be decompressed with a nasogastric tube, food and drink withheld,and the patient supported with intravenous fluids until definitive surgical intervention can be undertaken.Bright red blood in emesis implies active bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or proximal duodenum. Coffee-ground color (darker oxidized blood), on the other hand, implies a recent history of bleeding. Fortunately, gastrointestinal bleeding is relatively rare in children. Children who experience massive gastrointestinal bleeding frequently have predisposing conditions, such as esophageal varices from chronic liver disease (Table 6). When such bleeding is encountered, initial therapy always is stabilization and resuscitation of the patient. Minimal bleeding that does not result in any change in hemodynamics or hematocrit frequently can be treated with histamine-2 blockers or antacids. Larger hemorrhages, however, require further intervention. The rate and volume of bleeding should be measured early, and if significant, a nasogastric tube left in place for continuous monitoring and removal of the gastric blood. After stabilization, the patient should be transported to a facility where there are endoscopists and surgeons skilled in pediatric care and management of gastrointestinal bleeding.",

GER also is distinguished from true vomiting by its symptoms; the emesis of GER is effortless and generally not associated with retching or autonomic symptoms.Although the causes of vomiting in children are many, a thorough history of the nature of the vomiting and any associated signs or symptoms as well as a complete physical examination generally helps narrow the differential diagnosis (Table 1). Targeted studies help identify the cause of the illness.Acute gastroenteritis is the most common cause of vomiting in children. It is usually associated with diarrhea and abdominal pain, and viruses are common etiologic agents, although bacterial pathogens also must be considered. The most common viral agent in infants is rotavirus. Bacterial pathogens include Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli. Bacterial infections are associated more commonly with bloody diarrhea and high fevers than are viral infections. Enterohemorrhagic E coli 0157:H7 can cause hemorrhagic colitis and may be complicated by the development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Clostridium difficile is a bacterial pathogen that frequently is associated with the recent use of antibiotics. It causes a pseudo-membranous colitis, often with bloody diarrhea and associated with abdominal pain and vomiting. Giardia lamblia is a protozoan commonly associated with contaminated water and attendance at child care centers. It may cause watery diarrhea and vomiting.Diagnosis is made with stool bacterial cultures, rotazyme analysis for rotavirus, detection of C difficile toxin, and detection of ova and parasites for G lamblia. Sepsis,central nervous system infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia all can present with or involve vomiting, usually in addition to other symptoms.Labyrinthitis and pancreatitis both cause vomiting. Dizziness usually is associated with labyrinthitis and abdominal pain with pancreatitis.Inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease, also tend to involve vomiting. In these conditions, the vomiting frequently is related to altered motility with abnormal or dysfunctional swallowing, gastric emptying, or peristalsis.Both inborn errors of metabolism and endocrinologic disorders can cause vomiting (Table 2). The inborn errors of metabolism generally present in early infancy, and the vomiting is associated with symptoms of lethargy, hypo- or hypertonia, seizures, or coma. The constellation of symptoms is similar to that seen in sepsis, necessitating a high index of suspicion in the evaluation of these patients. The presence or absence of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, or ketosis and a family history that includes possible consanguinity can help to determine the diagnosis.One endocrinologic condition associated with vomiting is diabetes mellitus. Vomiting can complicate acute ketoacidosis or occur in patients who have had long-standing diabetes and consequent gastroparesis. Slowed gastric motility usually presents after diabetes mellitus has been present for approximately 10 years. Early satiety and a sense of fullness frequently precede the onset of vomiting in diabetic gastroparesis.Vomiting as a consequence of food-related sensitivity always should be considered. The variants encountered most commonly in pediatric patients are cow milk and soy protein intolerance,type I (IgE-mediated) food allergy, and celiac disease. Cow milk protein intolerance affects 2% to 7% of infants, with approximately 20% of these also sensitive to soy protein. In addition to vomiting, the patients usually have diarrhea that frequently is guaiac-positive. Celiac disease occurs only in children who eat gluten-containing foods. Patients typically suffer from wasting, irritability, and diarrhea, but vomiting also can occur.Vomiting occurs in any neurologic condition that involves increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (Table 3). Additionally, patients who have seizures, autonomic disorders (Riley-Day syndrome), and conditions affecting the floor of the fourth ventricle without increased ICP frequently have their condition worsened with vomiting.Cyclic vomiting is a unique entity that must be considered separately. Onset occurs typically at early school age, and it is characterized by acute-onset periodic episodes of nausea and vomiting interspersed with conspicuous periods of wellness.Approximately 77% of patients can identify precipitating events,usually intense emotional states. These patients have an increased incidence of migraine headaches and prevalence of epilepsy and irritable bowel syndrome. Because no diagnostic test or specific clinical identifying feature distinguishes cyclic vomiting syndrome from other potentially life-threatening conditions, the diagnosis can be made only after time has elapsed and upon exclusion of other diagnoses.Behavioral or psychological causes of vomiting can be problematic in the pediatric age group. Some children induce vomiting to seek attention in environments in which personal attention is lacking. The extreme of this behavior is rumination. Rumination is a serious condition that occurs in infants when there is a failure in reciprocal interaction between the infant and caregiver. The purposes of rumination are self-stimulation and satisfaction of needs. Rumination also is seen in older children, especially those who are severely mentally retarded.Classically, the infant (older than 3 months) learns to bring up gastric contents into the mouth, frequently by inserting a hand into the back of the throat or simply through rhythmic contractions of the pharynx, tongue, and abdominal muscles. The oral contents then are reswallowed, although spillage does occur. Not only do these patients suffer social deprivation, but the chronic emesis can lead to inanition and growth failure. The failure to thrive does not improve with traditional medical intervention, but rather requires sensitive and interactive nurturing. A mother-substitute who is empathic with and observant of both the parent’s and infant’s needs is required to help the parent establish more nurturing skills. More formal psychotherapeutic help frequently is needed for the parents.Bulimia, characterized by secretive binge-eating episodes followed by self-induced vomiting, is a cause of vomiting especially among teenagers.The anatomic and, thus, the generally surgical causes of nonbilious vomiting are those that affect the intestinal tract proximal to the point of bilious drainage (ampulla of Vater), which is proximal to the ligament of Treitz (Table 4). Whereas congenital anomalies usually present in the newborn period, acquired lesions can present at any age. Any infant who exhibits persistent nonbilious vomiting, with or without feeding, in the immediate newborn period must be suspected of having an intestinal atresia or a luminally obstructing lesion(pyloric stenosis, luminal band, web) proximal to the point of bile drainage(ampulla of Vater).An easy and rapid test to evaluate possible esophageal atresia is the ability to pass a nasogastric tube easily into the stomach. After the tube has been passed, it is important to obtain a radiograph to assure that the tube is in the stomach and not coiled in an atretic esophagus. Any resistance to passage of the tube is an indication for evaluation by contrast radiograph for an obstruction. If an obstruction is present, nasoesophageal tube drainage is important to prevent aspiration of pooled esophageal secretions. Contrast studies are the standard for the diagnosis of these conditions (Figs 2–4Figure 2Figure 3– Figure 4AFigure 4B). Although not absolute, anatomic conditions causing luminal obstruction distal to the ligament of Treitz usually cause bilious vomiting. Bilious vomiting is an ominous sign that mandates immediate evaluation(Table 5). In the newborn period, intestinal atresias and stenosis and malrotation with or without volvulus need to be ruled out immediately. In the older child, malrotation with volvulus also is a surgical emergency that is diagnosed relatively easily by gastrointestinal contrast study. After the diagnosis has been established radiographically, the gastrointestinal tract should be decompressed with a nasogastric tube, food and drink withheld,and the patient supported with intravenous fluids until definitive surgical intervention can be undertaken.Bright red blood in emesis implies active bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or proximal duodenum. Coffee-ground color (darker oxidized blood), on the other hand, implies a recent history of bleeding. Fortunately, gastrointestinal bleeding is relatively rare in children. Children who experience massive gastrointestinal bleeding frequently have predisposing conditions, such as esophageal varices from chronic liver disease (Table 6). When such bleeding is encountered, initial therapy always is stabilization and resuscitation of the patient. Minimal bleeding that does not result in any change in hemodynamics or hematocrit frequently can be treated with histamine-2 blockers or antacids. Larger hemorrhages, however, require further intervention. The rate and volume of bleeding should be measured early, and if significant, a nasogastric tube left in place for continuous monitoring and removal of the gastric blood. After stabilization, the patient should be transported to a facility where there are endoscopists and surgeons skilled in pediatric care and management of gastrointestinal bleeding.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "Rapid hormonal changes during pregnancy as well as psycho-social stressors accompanying parenthood have often been associated with peripartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder or with not yet clinically expressed bipolar diathesis. Yet, little is known about the correlation of peripartum onset of bipolar disorder in men. We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder with peripartum onset and subsequent episodes following the peripartum initiation of the disease, as well as the association of the couvade syndrome, as a pathological response to a man due to hormonal shifts observed in males cohabiting with a pregnant female. The patient had his first depressive episode during the peripartum period of his spouse, followed by two mixed episodes with psychotic features that leaded to his compulsory psychiatric evaluation and subsequent hospitalization and the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder I. There is a well-known correlation between the peripartum period and mood disturbances to the point of inducing full blown episodes, suggesting of a bipolar disorder initiation or mood episodes relapsing in female patients already diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Due to the patient's psychological disturbances and the phenomenology of his symptoms, mainly concerning the psychotic features accompanying his episodes, we discuss the possible underlying biological correlates as a triggering mechanism, that might overlap the manifestation of the Couvade Syndrome as well as the initiation or relapse of Bipolar Disorder in males. It seems that males are not less influenced by hormonal and psycho-social factors posed upon them during the peripartum period of their cohabiting female spouse.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a “young” disorder formally recognized in the early 1980s, although the symptoms have been noted for centuries particularly in relation to military conflicts. PTSD may develop after a serious traumatic experience that induces feelings of intense fear, helplessness or horror. It is currently characterized by three key classes of symptoms which must cause clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning: (1) persistent and distressing re-experiencing of the trauma; (2) persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness; and (3) persistent symptoms of hyper-arousal. One of the possible symptoms within the second class is difficulty in remembering an important aspect of the traumatic event. PTSD is not an uncommon condition, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of about 7-9% based on studies conducted in the United States and Canada, with women at higher risk than men. While not everyone who experiences a significant trauma will go on to develop PTSD, about a third will do so. Sexual assault, along with other forms of assaultive violence, pose a comparatively high risk of PTSD.",

In general, there is no documentation of specific injury to the brain or spinal cord from a simple whiplash (WAD 1-3). Whiplash-related neck pain is caused by a distortion of the cervical spine, and, as such, should be interpreted as a benign condition with a good prognosis. Whiplash should be considered a risk factor rather than a medical diagnosis. The association between cause (whiplash mechanism) and effect (symptoms) is poor.

It is unlikely, however, that these features are attributable solely to the psychological impact of the seizure condition or the use of antiseizure medications, as they are not common in persons with other types of seizure disorders treated with the same medications.<sup>1,2</sup>Their occurrence appears to be related rather to the existence of seizure discharges in limbic structures of the temporal lobe.<sup>2,3</sup>They may be improved by temporal lobectomy or antiseizure medications or during the immediate postictal state, presumably because of the control of these seizure discharges.<sup>2</sup>The mechanism by which the discharges contribute to sexual and reproductive dysfunction, however, has not been established. The demonstration of neuroendocrine dysfunction in temporal lobe epilepsy is consistent with a hormonal pathophysiologic mechanism (Archives1982;39:133-135).

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS in which psychoneurological symptoms prevail. For the diagnosis of PMDD, the specific DSM-5 criteria were developed by the American Psychiatric Association according to which the the diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of five or more symptoms in women during the week prior to menstruation and their disappearance a few days after the onset of menstruation. These symptoms are observed for at least two cycles. Treatment of women with PMS/PMDD, first of all, should start with the lifestyle adjustment, inclusion of regular mode rate physical activity into daily activities.

Patients do not always present with obsessions or compulsions and this may complicate the process of diagnosing and starting adequate treatment. In this article three patients suffering from OCD but not presenting with obsessions or compulsions are discussed. In the first case, in a 42-year-old woman, the presenting symptom is a therapy-resistant dermatitis, due to excessive washing. The second patient, a 27-year-old man, presented with a depression, a frequent comorbid condition. In the third case, a 34-year-old man, the effects on and the suffering of the partner and family of a patient with OCD (they were asked to co-operate in his compulsive behaviour) were the reason for his wife to consult the general practitioner. OCD has a lifetime prevalence rate of 2.5% and is somewhat more frequent in females than in males. The most characteristic symptoms are obsessions and/or compulsions. They cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), and interfere significantly with the person's functioning (occupational, social activities, relationships). Neurobiological studies suggest genetic influences and dysfunctional neuronal circuits in the brain. The treatment of OCD consists of pharmacotherapy and behavioural therapy, but it is a lifelong condition.",

Studies using retrospective self‐report of sexual attitude and behavior find an incidence of sexual dysfunction ranging from 14–66%. Sexual dysfunction may be more common in partial than in generalized epilepsies. Sexual dysfunction in epilepsy may result from a disturbance in social or psychological factors affecting sexual responsiveness. Alternatively, epileptiform discharges may disrupt the function of structures mediating sexual behavior, particularly the limbic cortex, or alter the release of hypothalamic or pituitary hormones. Antiepileptic drugs modulate hormone release from the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal axis and may have direct inhibitory effects on sexual behavior. Evidence both supports and refutes each of these etiologies in the sexual dysfunction seen with epilepsy. Specific evaluation and treatment protocols for patients with sexual dysfunction are available.",

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

Several studies have identified abnormal serotonergic parameters during the entire menstrual cycle and the luteal phase in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.‘ s p t t h t D h a r T t s c Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a combination of emotional, behavioral and physical symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, abate shortly after the onset of menses, and cause impairment in social and role functioning [1]. The hallmark emotional symptoms of PMDD include irritability, anxiety or tension, mood swings and depressed mood. PMDD occurs in approximately 5% of menstruating women and is considered the severe end of the spectrum of clinically significant premenstrual symptoms. Reduced quality of life (QoL), increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity at work have been documented in women with PMDD [2,3]. Recent reviews and expert guidelines summarize the diagnostic criteria, recommended forms for the prospective daily charting of symptoms and the importance of identifying a premenstrual exacerbation of an underlying mood or medical illness prior to the initiation of treatment [4–7]. The etiology of PMDD is likely to be multifactorial, and many possible etiological factors have been reviewed [8]. It is assumed that ovulation-related mechanisms trigger premenstrual symptoms in women with a vulnerability to CNS dysregulation [9]. Several studies have identified abnormal serotonergic parameters during the entire menstrual cycle and the luteal phase in women with PMDD [8]. Studies also suggest an abnormal response to allopregnanolone and other γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic agonists during the luteal phase of the cycle [10]. The",

      "abstract": "Procedural sedation (PS) is the technique of administering sedatives with or without analgesics to induce a condition in which the patient can tolerate unpleasant procedures while maintaining cardio-respiratory function. Planned PSs are performed with procedures of various invasiveness, painfulness and duration, but by definition, they do not reach the depth of general anesthesia and do not require the use of respiratory support or controlled mechanical ventilation, and even more – muscle relaxants. For effective PS, it is extremely important to establish verbal contact with the patient and achieve a stable emotional state of the patient and carefully explain to him the details of the PS. When choosing the depth of PS, it’s necessary to reach a compromise between the degree of anesthesia and amnesia, on the one hand, and the effectiveness of spontaneous breathing, as well as the possibility of an early recovery of consciousness, on the other. If possible, the problem of pain (when consciousness is partially preserved) or nociceptive stimuli (when the level of consciousness is reduced or absent) is solved separately through the use of local or regional anesthesia. In addition, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some other drugs with analgesic properties are often used, and opioid analgesics are avoided or used in small or minimal doses. Unlike anesthesia, even deep sedation cannot and should not completely prevent the patient from moving during intense pain / nociceptive stimuli. If necessary, the problem of patient movements is solved not only and not so much by further deepening sedation, but precisely by improving analgesia and/or fixing the patient for the duration of short-term painful manipulations. To achieve these goals, PS is most often used propofol, or its dexmedetomidine or midazolam. This publication focuses on the advantages of using a multimodal approach for prolonged PS, which allows for a significant reduction in the dose of corresponding drugs and rate of complications in comparison with sedation with a single anaesthetic at significantly higher doses.",

      "title": "Sexual activity after myocardial infarction",
      "abstract": "Sexual activity is no more physically demanding or harmful than other activities involving the same level of exercise and emotion. As a general rule, sexual activity can be resumed when the patient can walk a kilometre at a comfortable pace or climb two flights of stairs without undue breathlessness. Sexual patterns and positions used prior to the heart attack should be continued. Symptoms that occur during sexual intercourse or any other exercise should be reported to a doctor. Taking more than two alcoholic drinks or eating a large meal may hinder sexual activity. Psychological problems that interfere with sexual function can develop in patients or their partners. Anxiety and depression are the most common causes of reduced libido, impotence and frigidity. Some people abandon sex after a heart attack because they feel they have aged significantly as a result of their illness. Doctors should ask post-myocardial infarction patients about sexual activity when inquiring about other symptoms and well-being. Given support, understanding and attendance to any associated problems, most patients will recover their normal sexual function after a heart attack. (author abstract)",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affecting up to 7% of reproductive age women. Women with PMDD are of reproductive age; therefore, contraception and treatment of PMDD are important considerations. The disorder as described in the DSM-V is characterized by moderate to severe psychological, behavioral and physical symptoms beginning up to two weeks prior to menses, resolving soon after the onset of menstruation and significantly interfering with daily functioning. PMDD develops in predisposed individuals after they are exposed to progesterone at the time of ovulation. It has been hypothesized that PMDD is in part attributable to luteal phase abnormalities in serotonergic activity and to altered configuration of ℽ-aminobutyric acid subunit A (GABAA) receptors in the brain triggered by the exposure to the neuroactive steroid progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone (Allo). A large body of evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be effective in the treatment of PMDD. Combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) pills, specifically the 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/3mg drospirenone in a 24/4 extended cycle regimen has been shown to significantly improve the emotional and physical symptoms of PMDD. Other combined monophasic, extended cycle hormonal contraceptive pills with less androgenic progestins may also be helpful, although not well studied. Copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) are recommended for those not seeking hormonal contraceptives. Progestin-only methods including the progestin-only pill (POP), levonorgestrel (LNG) IUD, etonorgestrel implant or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) have the potential to negatively affect mood symptoms for women with or without baseline mood disorders, including PMDD. Careful counseling and close follow-up is recommended for patients with PMDD seeking these contraceptive methods.",

The mild depression of the puerperium has several intriguing aspects. Although it is associated with a critical phase in the life cycle, the dysphoria curiously occurs<i>after</i>delivery at a time when one would expect women to feel joyous.

      "abstract": "Secondary depression is common among primary alcoholics. However, its aetiology is poorly understood.Forty men with primary alcoholism, abstinent for two weeks or more, with a secondary major depressive episode were compared with forty matched never-depressed primary alcoholic controls for risk factors for depression and recent life events.In the six months before the onset of depression depressed alcoholics had experienced significantly more life events, more life events with negative impact, more dependent events caused by alcohol, and more independent events. Significantly more depressed alcoholics than controls had a family history of depression, a family history of suicidal behaviour and had themselves attempted suicide.Having recent life events, particularly events with negative impact, and a family history of depression are risk factors for secondary depression in alcoholics.",

Much of the time, feeling a specific degree of stress and nervousness can really help support your exhibition in explicit settings. For instance, an individual may encounter a degree of uneasiness the days paving the way to a public discourse, marriage, or another large life occasion. By and large, a touch of pressure and stress can be normal and is viewed as an entirely typical response. At the point when confronted with an impending task at work, a significant occasion, or even an arranged meeting, a great many people will experience a temporary feeling of apprehension and additional strain. Notwithstanding, persevering and solid sensations of apprehension and nervousness might be a lot greater concern. Nervousness and panicky sentiments that wait long after a stressor has passed, or which happen with no unmistakable explanation, may demonstrate that you are battling with an uneasiness problem.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

This article reports the case of a 20‐year‐old woman who has had absence epilepsy for 11 years that is evoked by thinking or talking about driving an automobile. This stimulus consistently precipitated absence seizures, as defined by clinical and electroencephalographic criteria. An emotionally traumatic early childhood event may play a role in the triggering mechanism. A similar case has not been reported. RÉSUMÉ Les crises d'épilepsie peuvent étre provoquées par de nombreux mécanismes inhabituels. Certains sont excessivement rares et surprenants, et restent apparemment d'observation isolée, chez un seul patient.

Ce stimulus a provoqué de façon reproductible des absences cliniques et eléctroencéphalographiques.

Se presenta un caso de una mujer de 20 &amp;#x006e;̄os con ausencias durante 11 a&amp;#x006e;̂os que se evocaban cuando pensaba o hablaba de conducción de automóviles. Estos estímulos siempre provocaban las ausencias, definidas con criterios clínicos y electroencefalográficos. Quizás un acontecimiento traumaático ocurrido en su infancia pueda ser el factor desencadenante. Según nuestra revisión no se han publicado casos semejantes en la literature.

Wir berichten über eine 20‐jährige Patientin mit Absence‐Epilepsie über II Jahre, die durch Nachdenken oder Sprechen über das Autofahren ausgelöst wurde. Dieser Stimulus ging jeweils den Absencen voraus, was anhand klinischer und elektroencephalographischer Kriterien bestätigt werden konnte. Möglicherweise spielt ein traumatisches emotionales Erleben in der frühen Kindheit eine Rolle. Ein ähnlicher Fall ist bisher nicht beschrieben worden.",

Life-long PE is best managed with PE pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor [SSRI] and/or topical anaesthetics). The management of acquired PE is aetiology-specific and may include erectile dysfunction (ED) pharmacotherapy in men with co-morbid ED. Behavioural therapy is indicated when psychogenic or relationship factors are present and is often best combined with PE pharmacotherapy in an integrated treatment programme. Delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, and/or anorgasmia may have a biogenic and/or psychogenic aetiology. Men with age-related penile hypoanesthesia should be educated, reassured, and instructed in revised sexual techniques which maximize arousal. No drugs have yet been approved by regulatory agencies for this purpose, and most drugs identified for potential use have limited efficacy, impart significant side effects, or are considered experimental in nature.",

The efficacy of symptom-onset dosing (medication taken only on luteal days when symptoms occur) needs further systematic study. Women going through the menopausal transition may need to adjust their antidepressant dosing regimen due to the change in frequency of menstruation. Anxiolytics, calcium, chasteberry and cognitive-behaviour therapy may also have a role in the treatment of premenstrual symptoms.",

No specific patient stereotype nor single risk factor can be used to easily identify which person or patient will attempt suicide. Mental health professionals often have to assess or manage suicide risk and this is challenging by reason of accurate methods of predicting remain elusive. Presence of multiple risk factors often suggest the need for additional evaluation for suicidal ideation, but an impending suicide attempt is not always recognized, even after evaluation by healthcare provider. More half of suicidals have seen a psychiatrist or psychologist or other healthcare provider within one month beforehand. The presentation of possible warning signs can be subtle and experience is required. Service provision for suicidal patients is often substandard, particularly at times of highest need such as after discharge from hospital or emergency department. As many as 75% or more of people who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental health disorder at the time of their death. The most common are bipolar disorder and schizophrenia over major depression. Between 25% and 50% of bipolar patients will attempt suicide at least once, and 5% to 20% will die by suicide. In schizophrenia diagnosis, 20% to 40% of patients will attempt suicide and more than 10% will die by suicide. Additional risk factors: alcohol misuse, family history, illegal substance use. The way in which suicide is broached and discussed with patient plays a significant role. Here, a focus on clinical management of suicide risk.

The DSM-IV also excludes confounding disorders and requires confirmation of the diagnosis after 2 months of prospective daily ratings. These strict criteria reinforce the fact that not all women who have premenstrual symptoms have a mental illness. These criteria also allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is primarily reserved for milder physical and emotional symptoms.5 These criteria allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual magnification (PMM), which occurs when symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder are magnified during the premenstruum.6",

      "abstract": "T he present paper is describing a case of persistent genital arousal disorder that developed to a 55-year-old woman, shortly after the initiation of zolpidem.Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is a clinical entity that appears with a relatively low frequency in women, and is characterized by persistent or recurrent, unwanted and bothersome feelings of genital arousal, which often do not resolve with orgasm and are not associated with sexual desire (sexual interest, thoughts or fantasies).Women who experience PGAD often have feelings of shame, guilt and distress.Although its exact etiology remains unclear, various etiological factors have been proposed, central or peripheral, which may be psychological, vascular, dietary, pharmacological or neurological.Additionally, its presence has been associated to restless legs syndrome and overactive bladder syndrome.Likewise, multiple therapeutic interventions have been proposed and tried in patients with PGAD, either pharmacological (SSRIs, SNRIs, antiandrogens, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsive agents) or other (ECT, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, nerve stimulation).Zolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine indirect GABA A receptor agonist, which has lately been used as a therapeutic agent for PGAD in some cases.Nevertheless, in our patient, receiving zolpidem for insomnia seemed to be timely connected to the onset of PGAD symptomatology.The aim of the present paper is to highlight the need for more research into the possible factors that may contribute to PGAD.",

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

      "abstract": "Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state characterised by fearfulness and unwanted and distressing physical symptoms.It is a normal and appropriate response to stress but becomes pathological when it is disproportionate to the severity of the stress, continues after the stressor has gone, or occurs in the absence of any external stressor.Neurotic disorders with anxiety as a prominent symptom are common: a recent British survey found that 16% of the population suffered from some form of pathological anxiety.Anxiety disorders should be differentiated from stress reactions, in which anxiety may be a prominent feature.These include acute stress reactions-a rapid response (in minutes or hours) to sudden stressful life events, leading to anxiety with autonomic arousal and some disorientation-and adjustment reactions-slower responses to life events (such as loss of job, moving house, or divorce) that occur days or weeks later as symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and depression (without biological symptoms).These are generally self limiting and are helped by reassurance, ventilation, and problem solving.A more profound stress reaction, post-traumatic stress disorder, is described below.Until recently, the commonest response to a presentation of anxiety has been to prescribe a benzodiazepine.This has been much criticised and alternatives have been evaluated, including almost all the available antidepressants and psychological treatments, especially cognitive behaviour therapy.For most general practitioners, constraints on resources are likely to mean that drugs remain the mainstay of treatment.",

      "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

      "abstract": "textabstractThe term migraine stems from hemicrania, describing a periodic disorder consisting of\nparoxysmal unilateral headache, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia and/or\nphonophobia. Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8). These results show\nthat migraine patients world-wide are still not receiving adequate treatment and a significant\nunmet need in migraine care still remains.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of growth and pubertal development in the teenage years present as a spectrum of abnormalities embracing common normal variants, less common disease states, and rare disorders increasingly recognised and understood as genetic in origin. This brief review is intended to provide a guide to the diagnosis of problems presenting most commonly in adolescent/teenage children, to help with initial assessment and management and to stress the need for referral to appropriate endocrine or other specialist services. Long-term management of individual diagnoses is beyond the scope of this article (references are provided for further reading). In order to focus on the teenage child, precocious puberty (by definition, before the age of 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys) is not discussed, but readers can seek guidance from a recent review 1. Delayed grow th and puberty Pubertal delay is the commonest problem seen. It is usually associated with apparent poor growth ‐ but not necessarily with short stature, as growth rate is intimately related to pubertal development. What may seem to be growth failure is an inevitable consequence if a child is later than average with timing of onset of puberty (as are 50% of children!). The clinical problem is to decide whether development is abnormal, in terms of being late with the onset of puberty or of failing to progress to completion of puberty at a normal rate (arrested puberty). Growth delay is common and usually there is no underlying pathology (boys in particular may none the less benefit from treatment), whereas arrested pubertal development is a major cause for concern. By convention, delayed puberty is defined as lack of puberty at an age +2 standard deviations (SD) above the population mean (boys: 14 years; girls: 13 years) 2 . The mean time to progress from puberty onset in boys to adult testicular volume is 3.2± 1.8 years (mean ± SD), and in girls from onset of breast development to menarche is 2.41.1 (mean ± SD) years. Thus, if 4‐ 5 years have elapsed from puberty onset without completion, investigations should be made. Delayed puberty may be classified as primary delay (constitutional) or secondary delay (underlying chronic illness). Children with failure to enter puberty because of a disorder of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis may also be divided into two groups, having either hypogonadotrophic or hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism",

Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis. Following the choosing of an effective psycho-pharmacological combination, and with the goal of reducing a leading symptom, according to enlarged diagnostic process, we decided to diagnose the Schizoaffective disorders (F 25.2).",

      "abstract": "The physical symptoms attending the general paralysis of the insane have been shown to present in their progress three well-defined stages. Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and senseless thoughts, images, or impulses that occur repeatedly. Obsessions are experienced as unwanted and involuntary by the patient and can focus on such themes as contamination, aggression, orderliness, religion, sex:, doubt, or loss of possessions. Compulsions are ritualistic but seemingly purposeful behaviors that are often performed in response to an obsession. These compulsive behaviors, either observable or mental, alleviate or neutralize anxiety associated with the obsession. The patient fears the outcome should he or she not perform the ritual, despite the knowledge that the fear is irrational. Because the ritual does not entirely relieve the fear, the impulse to repeat the ritual returns. Common compulsive behaviors include hand-washing, checking, arranging, touching, repeating, or hoarding. Table 1 summarizes diagnostic criteria according to the American Psychiatric Association. l Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs at some point during a lifetime in approximately 2.5 to 3 percent of the population; it is equally common in men as in women, and one-third of the cases begin by the age of 15 years.2 As with many other psychiatric illnesses, patients might not seek care until years after the onset of the disease. A variety of causes have been proposed: behavioral, developmental, biochemical, psychological, and genetic. Familial tendencies have been seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one sample of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 71 percent had a parent with either full-blown obsessive-compulsive disotder or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.3 The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder have also previously been viewed as extreme variants of normal developmental rituals",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Psychogenic tics with onset around 60 years of age are rarely described in the literature. <strong>Case report:</strong> A 67-year-old female had experienced phonic tics for 8 years. Episodes occurred without premonitory sensations and precipitant factors, and she could not suppress them. She had no history of childhood tic disorder, and secondary causes of tics were excluded. She was diagnosed with psychogenic tics and treated with quetiapine with mild improvement. <strong>Discussion:</strong> When physicians are faced with no identifiable cause of tics combined with certain clinical clues, a psychogenic disorder must be suspected.",

Approximately 5% of women with the severest form of PMS usually have symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). Women with severe PMS and PMDD have reported disruption in their social relationships, parenting roles, and work productivity as well as increased healthcare utilization. Premenstrual symptoms have been reported in women from menarche through perimenopause. PMS has been reported to be more common in women who assign negative attributions to premenstrual symptoms, have poor coping strategies and problem-solving abilities, and feel their symptoms are not in their control. One of the unique aspects of treating women with severe PMS and PMDD is that symptoms, though cyclical, may be present for 40 years of a woman's life.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

The DSM-V defines insomnia disorder as one or more of: difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning wakening with an inability to fall back asleep.

The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

Although some contradictory results exist, the majority of studies demonstrate that depressed patients experience more stressful events in the months that precede the onset of their disorder than do normal controls or schizophrenics. In calculating relative risk figures, it seems that depressive risk is increased by a factor of about 5 or 6 for the six months after an event. Certain events, such as undesirable, loss, or severely threatening events, are particularly likely to precede a depression. These results suggest that stressful events can bring about depressive episodes, but most of the evidence that supports this conclusion emanates from retrospective studies, and corroborating prospective studies are definitely needed. Furthermore, not all depressives report precipitating events, so other causal factors are also operative.",

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary.

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose : Absence status epilepticus (AS) is a prolonged, generalized, and nonconvulsive seizure that may occur in various circumstances. We report a series of patients in whom recurrent, unprovoked, typical AS was the main clinical feature. Method : We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients referred to our epileptic centers, on the following criteria: (1) recurrent, unprovoked episodes of typical AS representing the unique or the predominant seizure type, (2) at least one episode of AS recorded by video‐EEG or by EEG only, and (3) clinical and EEG features fulfilling the criteria of idiopathic epilepsy. We excluded patients with situation‐related AS. Results : We found 11 such cases (5F, 6M). The onset of AS was after puberty or in early adulthood in most; no clear triggering factor could account for the recurrence of AS episodes; infrequent generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and, rarely, absences, could also occur. These patients had no family history of epilepsy, normal neurological evaluation, normal neuroimaging, interictal EEG showing generalized spike‐ and polyspike‐wave discharges on a normal background, no photoparoxysmal response, variable response of AS to intravenous benzodiazepines, and usually good seizure control with valproate. This peculiar condition was misdiagnosed in most because of the unusual clinical presentation and of some atypical interictal EEG findings, often leading to the use of inappropriate drugs. Conclusion : Although there is some overlap with previously described epilepsy syndromes, specific and shared features point to the existence of a distinct epilepsy entity that we propose to name “absence status epilepsy.” This syndrome expands the spectrum of idiopathic generalized epilepsies.",

If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 1a and “No” to Question 1b (parent reports past depression but denies current episode), the interviewer should assess suicide risk (Questions 12a–12d) and then skip to the section on Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 12a, 12b, 12c, or 12d, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child's current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventative action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “Yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

      "title": "Social rhythm regulation",
      "abstract": "As discussed in Chapter 1, for many young people, exacerbation of manic or depressive symptoms occurs through a spiral of contributing factors, both biological and psychosocial. Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "abstract": "Many of the congenital neurologic diseases can result in incapacity or death of the animal.Some of them, such as idiopathic epilepsy and hydrocephalus, exhibit breed or familial predisposition and a genetic basis was proved or suggested.Some diseases can be presumptively diagnosed after a detailed signalment (breed predisposition), history (e.g.family history because many of these defects have familial tendencies), and through physical exam; other diagnostic methods (radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance, electrophysiologic tests, etc.) can provide supportive evidence for the congenital defect and help to confirm the diagnosis.Some cases can lead to civil law-suits when the lesions are congenital, but not easily recognizable, or when the lesions are hereditary but tend to became manifest only after some time (more than 12 months after the date of purchase, e.g., after the vice-free guarantee period has expired).Moreover, quite frequently an early diagnosis is not made because there are delays in consulting the veterinarian or the general practitioner veterinarian does not perceive subtle signs.This study was designed to focus on the medico-legal aspects concerning the buying and selling in Italy of dogs and cats affected by congenital and hereditary neurologic diseases that could constitute vice in these animals.While adequate provisions to regulate in detail the various aspects of pet sale have still to be drawn up by legislators, it may be helpful to involve breeders, by obliging them by contract to extend guarantees in the case of hereditary lesions, including neurologic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a syndrome that occurs due to the difficulty of a patient in doing his cognitive and instrumental activities of daily life with the same performance as before, bringing him losses. This syndrome is caused by numerous primary and secondary etiologies. The most common primary cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which reaches almost 50% of dementia cases. The DA it consists of biological fragments of the amyloid precursor protein that are deposited in the brain 10 years or more, before the first symptoms appear. The period before the onset of symptoms is called the preclinical stage. The transition between the silence of symptoms and their appearance, usually due to memory loss for recent events, is known as the prodromal phase. Continuing the pathophysiological process, the stage of mild dementia takes place, when the patient has one more cognitive component associated with memory loss; follows the moderate, severe, profound and terminal phase of dementia.",

It is not frequent and it appears only in puberty, in boys as well as in girls, and it has been called \"acute obsessive crisis\". It appears suddenly in the form of a very intense anguish with the constant repetition of questions about the possibility of being in mortal sin and with the evidence of poorness of thought. The acute period lasts about 72 hours and then remission begins spontaneously and in one week it is all over. The evolution of this syndrome showed that it is not repeated later and that it does not leave any defect. It is essential to make the differential diagnosis with schizophrenia. The author's hypothesis is that acute obsessive crisis is the extreme manifestation of the painful mental experiences associated to corporal changes so frequent during puberty.",

      "abstract": "A young woman with intense longings for love was unable to satisfy these desires by a normal sexual relationship with a man because of her fears and inhibitions. She developed urticaria at times when her longings were especially stimulated and frustrated. Twelve attacks were observed during analysis and their emotional settings are described. Eight of them occurred in connection with dreams. These dreams invariably ended on the verge of frustration in an \"almost but not quite\" situation. Other types of dreams out of a total of 94 were never followed by urticaria and vice versa, with the exception of a repetitive dream of reaching for an object or person who slipped from the patient's grasp. This dream was followed by weeping, when not by urticaria. The urticaria appeared when weeping was repressed and often terminated when the patient wept. Some of the observations are somewhat suggestive concerning the choice of sites for the urticaria. The findings were confirmed by a second analyzed case and by a few observations on five cases seen in interview. In connection with other observations, particularly on asthma, they led to the supposition of a possible relationship between certain states of allergic sensitivity and states of intense frustrated longing.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenien treten weltweit mit einer Lebenszeitprävalenz von etwa 1 % auf. Wieso ist eine teilweise erblich bedingte und oft schwer verlaufende Erkrankung so weit verbreitet und tritt relativ häufig auf? Eine mögliche Erklärung besagt, dass es neben den Krankheitssymptomen auch Auswirkungen der Disposition oder der Erkrankung selbst gibt, die sich - zumindest bei Familienangehörigen oder nur leicht Erkrankten - positiv auswirken. Ein möglicher Grund ist das Fehlen der latenten Inhibition bisher unwichtiger Reize bei schizophrenen Patienten: Wird in einer Versuchsanordnung eine Vielzahl von Reizen präsentiert, von denen aber nur ein einziger als Hinweisreiz fungiert, auf den reagiert werden muss, um eine Belohnung zu erzielen, filtern Gesunde die unwichtigen Reize schnell aus. Wechselt aber unangekündigt die Versuchsanordnung und ein bisher unwichtiger Reiz ist nun der Hinweisreiz, dann brauchen Gesunde meist recht lange, um den Reiz zu entdecken. Von latenter Inhibition wird gesprochen, weil Gesunde sehr viel länger brauchen, den Reiz zu entdecken, wenn er bereits vorhanden, aber bisher unwichtig war, als wenn er neu in der Situation auftritt. Die bisherige Bedeutungslosigkeit des Reizes „hemmt” also seine Wahrnehmung als Hinweisreiz. Anders ist dies bei schizophrenen Patienten: Sie hemmen die Wahrnehmung des bisher unwichtigen Reizes offenbar weniger effektiv, so dass sie ihn schneller erkennen können, wenn er beim Wechsel der Versuchsbedingungen zum Hinweisreiz wird. Zwar brauchen sie insgesamt oft deutlich länger als Gesunde, um die Versuchsanordnung zu bewältigen, gemessen an ihrer üblichen Reaktionszeit gelingt ihnen der Wechsel auf die neue Reizkonstellation aber schneller als den Gesunden [2]. Schizophrene Menschen können also in unüblichen oder neuartigen Situationen beobachten, dass ein vermeintlich wohl bekanntes Zeichen seine Bedeutung ändert und dies einen Hinweis auf das Verständnis der Situation geben könnte - vielleicht ein Grund dafür, dass psychotische Erfahrungen viele Künstler zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts stark beeinflusst haben, die die Situation des Menschen in der Industriegesellschaft neu verstehen wollten [3].",

At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. There must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months, although the duration may be shortened with appropriate treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medications. Adjunctive psychological and social interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

In this phase, an explanation and the advice to start moving the neck again gradually after a brief period of rest are sufficient. If this phase is followed by a transition to complaints that can no longer be explained by the physical consequences of the accident, we speak of a chronic postwhiplash syndrome. In such a case there are factors besides the trauma that either induce the complaints or cause them to persist. Unless these factors are eliminated (the biopsychosocial model), the chance of success of any form of treatment is slight. There are indications that therapies directed at aspects of behavioural psychology can make an important contribution to recovery.",

      "abstract": "Perinatal mental illness influences obstetric outcomes, mother-baby interactions and longer term emotional and cognitive development of the child. Psychiatric disorders have consistently been found to be one of the leading causes of maternal deaths, often through suicide. Postnatal depression and puerperal psychosis are two disorders most commonly associated with the perinatal period. The most efficient strategy to identify patients at risk relies on focussing on clinically vulnerable subgroups: enquiries about depressive symptoms should be made at the usual screening visits. Attention should be paid to any sign of poor self-care, avoidance of eye contact, overactivity or underactivity, or abnormalities in the rate of speech. Particular care should be taken to ask about suicidal ideation and thoughts of harming others, including the baby. One of the most important risk factors is a previous history of depression. The degree of risk is directly correlated with severity of past episodes. Both antenatal and postnatal depression are being increasingly recognised in men. Puerperal psychosis is rare (1 to 2 per 1,000). Sixty per cent of women with puerperal psychosis already have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Women with a personal history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar affective disorder should be considered as high risk for postpartum psychosis. All pregnant women who are identified as being at high risk should have a shared care plan for their late pregnancy and early postnatal psychiatric management. Women with current mood disorder of mild or moderate severity who have a first-degree relative with a history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis should be referred for psychiatric assessment.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

Onset is insidious, idiopathic, and hastened by neurological incident or infection. Typically, the initial onset occurs during the teen years or after the second decade, although cases have been documented in early childhood, adulthood, and senescence. KLS is marked by unexpected debilitating, yet reversible, episodic hypersomnia, with varying recurrence rates; cognitive and behavioral impairment; compulsive eating; and feelings of derealization, hypersexuality, apathy, and depressed mood. Diagnosis is problematic due to the syndrome's rarity, disparity of presenting clinical symptoms, and misdiagnosis. Correct diagnosis can take up to 4 years. The clinical course is approximately 8 to 14 years from initial onset, yet may be longer in the adult form of the disorder. KLS has been shown to impact activities of daily living, usurping an adolescent of his/her social relations with peers, experiences, and time.

      "abstract": "The biomechanical expert opinion on the injury mechanism is necessary in few cases only. However, the judgement of these cases is extremely compromised if mechanically wrong terms are introduced in the clinical report. Since the injury mechanism in the neck is very complex the clinical physician should concentrate on the clinical findings familiar to him; usually the clinician lacks technical case documentation and specific training in injury biomechanics. The relevant mechanisms of neck injuries are an indirect trauma induced by a) a head contact leading to compression, hyperflexion, hyperextension and/or hypertranslation and b) a non-head-contact mechanism (hyperflexion or hyperextension, hypertranslation, acceleration). A non-contact mechanism occurs e.g. during a rear end impact without head restraint (hyperextension) or a frontal collision of a belted occupant (hyperflexion) without head impact. The term \"whiplash\" is misleading and incorrect: It presumes a virtually non existing two phase movement back and forth (or vice versa) like during the development of the crack of the whip. Secondly, it mixes the physical criterion mechanism with the anatomical or morphological criterion injury e.g. distortion, sprain etc. A (head)-contact mechanism is due to a corresponding momentum exerted from the head on the neck.

During a contact mechanism as well as during a non-contact mechanism not only a hyperflexion or a hyperextension can occur; in the first phase of the impact also a shearing force between the upper vertebral bodies (CO-C2) may load the intervertebral structures by hypertranslation.",

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms and disorders are highly prevalent throughout life, particularly in the middle-aged. From adolescence, women have a 1.5-3 times higher risk than men of suffering different depressive disorders. Traditionally, it has been assumed that transition to menopause, or perimenopause, is a period of higher depressive vulnerability, although there is some degree of controversy. This period seems to be associated with the appearance of both depressive symptoms and de novo depressive disorders, particularly if a background of depression exists. With regard to its etiopathogeny, genetic, hormonal, psychological and sociocultural factors have been suggested, but there are no solid data that support any of these explanations. Treatment basically depends on the severity of the disorder and includes antidepressants and/or psychotherapy. Maintained treatment with hormone replacement therapy (estrogens) is under discussion.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related painful erections (SRPE) are characterized by penile pain occurring during nocturnal erections, without apparent penile pathology. Sleep loss caused by the disorder may result in severe anxiety, mood disorders, irritability, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Until now, the phenomenon of SRPE has not been well understood. The rarity of the published cases probably does not reflect the actual prevalence, which is presumably over 1 percent. Because of the bizarre nature of the complaints, patients are often referred to a psychiatrist. The authors present the case of a 69-year-old patient, who, during frequent nocturnal awakenings, experienced hard-to-define burning, tingling sensations in symmetric hypogastric localisation. Sometimes the skin of both legs, and, occasionally, the arms and hands was involved, too. Initially, however, no definite erection-associated penile pain was present. Micturating quite a small amount just after awakening consistently resulted in immediate and complete relief. After two years, painful nocturnal erections reoccurring at stable intervals of 90–120 minutes during sleep developed to be the leading complaint. In default of urological or gastroenterological pathology, the patient has been referred to a psychiatrist. Quite futilely, mianserin and alprazolam, later sertralin and carbamazepine, respectively, were administered. Clozapine has also been tried out; however, it has to be rejected due to some adverse effects. Finally, 10 mg baclofen in the evening resulted in complete and permanent remission. This is consonant with the literature data stating that only clonazepam, baclofen and clozapine are likely to have long term beneficial effects in SRPE.",

      "title": "Management of chronic non-cancer pain in primary care",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mrs Yeo, a 68-year-old woman, came to you for chronic back pain, which had been persistent for the past year. She had been doctor-hopping, hoping to find an effective pain relief. About 6 months ago, she visited an orthopaedics specialist, who diagnosed her with degenerative disc disease and offered surgery, but she was not keen. Due to the back pain, Mrs Yeo stopped her part-time job 3 months ago and had been staying home more often instead of participating in community activities or interacting with her neighbours. She expressed hopelessness and lamented about the impact of the back pain on her function and lifestyle.WHAT IS CHRONIC PAIN? Chronic pain refers to pain that lasts for more than 3 months and persists past normal healing time. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, pain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage\". It is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological and social factors.[1] The perception of pain is often affected by personal life experiences, emotional factors, personal belief systems and family upbringing and values. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE? About 8.7% of the Singapore population experiences chronic pain.[2] Within this subset, a higher prevalence of chronic pain is present among females (10.9%) and it increases significantly among people above 65 years old. Chronic pain is a risk factor for psychological disorders. A Singapore cross-sectional epidemiological survey showed that chronic pain is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio 2.4) and generalised anxiety disorder (odds ratio 3.0).[3] The economic effects of chronic pain are substantial. Another local cross-sectional study showed that episodic migraine alone posed an economic burden of SGD 1 billion per year, translating to about 2% of total government healthcare expenditure in Singapore.[4] HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? With Singapore's ageing population, the prevalence of chronic pain is expected to increase, and it will be beneficial for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) to manage uncomplicated chronic pain conditions. Complex cases may still eventually require a pain specialist's review. Chronic pain is challenging to manage in primary care. Although there are few studies conducted on the local practice of chronic pain management, some common barriers have been identified. In a local qualitative study, fellow physicians in Singapore shared that a considerable number of physicians still view chronic pain in a biomedical model rather than a biopsychosocial model. In addition, the older community often feels stigmatised or views it negatively when offered psychological treatments for chronic pain. This lack of public awareness also deters physicians from referring older persons for psychological treatment. Keeping a close and therapeutic relationship with patients, involving the family members and having consistent graduated patient education on the multifaceted nature of chronic pain were found to be helpful.[5] In our local context, chronic pain management may incur considerable costs, especially in the aspect of psychological treatment, which may not be covered under government subsidy schemes such as Medisave. This, in turn, can further deter patients from pursuing holistic treatment. FPs and GPs can look into these factors and better reach out to patients. In this article, we aim to shed light on the range of management strategies available to manage chronic pain conditions [Box 1]. Chronic pain management is complex to manage in a primary care setting and it often requires multidisciplinary co-management (FP or GP, pain specialist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and psychologist) with the necessary patient empowerment and link-up with community resources.Box 1: Common chronic non-cancer pain conditions.WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Chronic and acute pain management has some similarities, although their management differs in some regard due to the different pathophysiologies. Besides the underlying nociceptive or neuropathic pain, the perception of pain and suffering is often contributed by psychological factors, personal beliefs, life experiences and social factors such as financial struggles or litigation.[6] It should be ingrained into our daily practice to elicit and address the root causes to manage chronic pain effectively. Figure 1 shows a brief overview of an approach that can be applied in primary care. For patients with chronic pain lasting from months to years, the priority is not to eliminate pain completely, as this is often ambitious to achieve, but to improve function and quality of life. Chronic pain should be treated with a multimodal 4 'P's approach, which are Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (Physical, Psychological and Procedural) strategies. These strategies can be initiated early and concurrently for greater effectiveness and to instill confidence in the doctor–patient relationship.Figure 1: Chart shows the overview of approach to chronic pain in primary care.Non-pharmacological therapy The pathophysiology in chronic pain commonly involves central sensitisation and may be associated with underlying psychiatric conditions. Chronic pain management can be effective with non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy, yoga, mindfulness, exercise, heat and cold application therapy, acupuncture, patient education and empowerment. However, the effect of these interventions was reported to be either immediate or short term, which suggests that non-pharmacological interventions should be done regularly for a sustained effect.[7] A typical physiotherapy course consists of two or three sessions each week for a duration of 8–12 weeks. Failure to show improvement within this time frame should prompt the physician to reconsider if physiotherapy is still recommended.[8] However, in the local context, due to exceeding demand for subsidised physiotherapy services, public healthcare institutions are unable to accommodate two or three sessions per week for each patient. These limited resources can be made more available and efficient by educating and empowering patients with the right mindset and attitudes towards exercise regime. Empowerment can further enable patients to sustain the efforts and reap its benefits. Pharmacological therapy Chronic pain can be broadly classified into nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Generally, nociceptive pain is sharp and well localised, while neuropathic pain is characterised by paraesthesia (numbing, shooting, cramping sensation) and may be poorly localised. Occasionally, patients may present with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Among patients who have end-stage knee or hip osteoarthritis, which is traditionally understood as nociceptive pain, about 35% of women and 27% of men have pain features that are suggestive of neuropathic knee pain.[9] This dichotomy can assist FPs and GPs to prescribe the appropriate pharmacological therapy. Typically, all pain should be treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain guidelines, starting with non-opioid modalities to weak opioids and escalating to opioid therapy, with gabapentinoids and antidepressants conventionally reserved for neuropathic pain. If the pain is mild, a single analgesia can be given. For moderate or severe pain, combining multiple analgesic agents should be considered. These combination therapies have synergistic effects, which allow for lower doses of each analgesia and reduce the risks of adverse effects of each analgesia. When initiating treatment, the efficacy can be assessed after 2–4 weeks. If deemed ineffective, the medication can be switched to an alternative agent, reduced or withdrawn. The effect of pharmacological therapy is short-lived, and this may encourage patient reliance on medications in the long term, leading to higher risks of adverse effects. Hence, treatment often needs to be individualised, directed according to patients' functional limitations and goals, and kept as short a period as possible [Table 1].Table 1: Overview of common non-opioid pharmacological agents.[ 10 ]Opioid therapy Discussion surrounding opioid therapy should include the common side effects and the increased risks of opioid dependence and abuse. In line with the recent release of the Ministry of Health Opioid Guidelines, long-term opioid therapy should not be routinely prescribed.[11] If a patient is started on opioid therapy, regular assessments of the patient's response should be conducted. The doctor should consider ceasing the therapy if there is no improvement in the quality of life or achievement of functional outcomes, or if there is any suspicion of abuse. The risk factors of opioid therapy include developing comorbidities such as major depression and psychosis, suicidal tendencies and substance abuse. There are several scoring systems for prediction of aberrant use before initiation of opioid therapy, such as the 'Opioid Risk Tool' and the 'Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain' (SOAPP).[12] With these screening tools, the risks of aberrant behaviour from opioid use can be stratified as low risk, moderate risk or high risk. Low-risk patients are generally deemed reasonable to start opioid therapy in primary care. High-risk patients should be referred to pain specialist for further management. Procedural treatment Lastly, there are various types of procedures that can help manage chronic pain, such as injections and nerve blocks. Patients who are suffering from chronic back pain due to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain or post-surgery syndrome may benefit from having epidural injections.[13] There is debatable evidence for intra-articular injectables for the management of chronic knee osteoarthritis.[14] Timely referral to tertiary pain specialists and, hence, access to these procedures can help to provide synergistic effort in managing chronic pain. As a result, patients can achieve significant improvement in pain control, which will strengthen their adherence to subsequent treatments. HOW CAN I PROVIDE MORE HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT? Patients with chronic pain often have associated psychological complications such as depression and anxiety, and face social issues such as unemployment. This is especially prominent among patients with a low socioeconomic status. A local study showed that a person with chronic pain is twice as likely to face unemployment compared to a person of similar socioeconomic status without chronic pain.[15] It is challenging for FPs and GPs to thoroughly address these issues in a time-efficient manner. However, FPs and GPs can value-add by improving communication with tertiary centres, highlighting new issues and working together to best manage these psychosocial issues. There are several support groups available for patients and their caregivers, such as the Knee Osteoarthritis Improvement Group for patients with knee osteoarthritis and the Autoimmune Diseases Support Group for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TOUCH Community Services also has a community musculoskeletal clinic which is mainly run by physiotherapists. Patients facing employment woes can also approach government agencies such as Workforce Singapore, which provides training opportunities, career guidance and links to job openings. The Skillsfuture programme provides a platform to access courses and training to improve employability. National Arthritis Foundation is a charitable body which raises funds to be utilised as financial subsidies for financially needy patients for treatment or to enhance employment prospects. In addition, patient's mental well-being often suffers along with the chronic pain. Chronic pain can also bring about friction among family members as patients assume the sick role. With multiple facets of life affected, these patients may find it difficult to access help and have respite. FPs and GPs can suggest and link up the patients with available community resources. Besides the Samaritans of Singapore hotline, there are various avenues for counselling that may be helpful [Table 2]. These organisations include Silver Ribbon Singapore, which offers free basic counselling services, and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), which provides in-person counselling sessions. Other organisations may have religious roots, in which some patients may find the counselling more relatable. These include Shan You, an organisation with buddhist roots, and Calvary Community Care, which was founded by a church. Typically, churches have volunteers who provide help with counselling as well.Table 2: Summary of community resources.*WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? Doctors should refer their patients to a specialist in these scenarios: (a) the patient has persistent pain that significantly impacts on function and quality of life or causes anxiety and/or depression, and has not responded to initial management; (b) the patient continues to seek medical treatment for persistent pain that cannot be explained; (c) the patient is a possible candidate for interventional treatment; (d) the patient requires high-dose opioid therapy, shows possible opioid dependence or has a moderate-to-high risk of opioid dependence based on risk screening tools; and (e) the patient needs multimodal treatment not available in a primary care setting. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES Elucidate the cause of the pain. If the chronic pain is secondary to a mechanical pathology (i.e. spinal stenosis or osteoarthritis), explore if surgical options have been discussed. Chronic non-cancer pain often has many facets. Considering the biopsychosocial aspects of the presentation can help to identify various contributing factors and provide effective treatment. 4 'P's management: Pharmacological, Physical, Psychological and Procedural. There are numerous pharmacological treatments available, and these medications can be directed based on the type of pain and the underlying contributing disease. Opioid therapy is often associated with adverse effects, misuse and dependence. Utilising risk screening tools and regular monitoring can help to reduce these problems and allow for early detection and intervention. Patients should be empowered through patient education and understand the various treatments for better management of chronic pain. Consider other non-pharmacological treatments as a multimodal approach, especially for patients who may not be suitable for surgical treatment and aggressive pharmacological treatment due to its adverse effects. Consider psychosocial implications of chronic pain and offer management options for more holistic care. Timely referral to a tertiary centre should be considered and made in the above-mentioned situations. Closing Vignette You found out that Mrs Yeo had mild depression brought on by the chronic back pain and the resultant functional limitations. She had previously been trialled on paracetamol and short courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. You started her on combination therapy, including duloxetine, and explained to her about the biopsychosocial nature of chronic pain. On review, Mrs Yeo's pain had improved, although it was still causing functional limitations. You referred her to a pain specialist for consideration of procedural treatment, as well as a physiotherapist and psychologist. After 3 months, Mrs Yeo reported that she was feeling much better and was now able to better ambulate in the community.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "In a previous publication (Brown and Birley, 1968) we have presented some findings which suggest that life changes and crises frequently precipitate the acute onset, relapse or exacerbation of schizophrenic states. To summarize : consecutively admitted patients diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia were seen at mental hospitals serving a known catchment area. The first fifty whose onsets occurred within three months of admission and could be accurately dated within a week were included. Both the patient and at least one other informant were interviewed about the occurrence of certain previously defined and datable events occurring to the patient or to close relatives. These included such events as moving house, starting or leaving a job, admission to hospital, birth, marriage or death during the twelve weeks prior to onset. These were classified, according to their apparent independence of the patient's control, as ‘independent’ or ‘possibly independent’. The former were those which could be regarded as outside his control, e.g. discovering a burglary or hearing of a brother's serious illness. ‘Possibly independent’ events were those which were considered to have been within the patient's control but which had not been brought about by any unusual behaviour on the patient's part. They were chiefly changes of job, or of opposite sex friends. (Loss of job would, under certain circumstances, be rated as ‘independent’, e.g. when a whole firm closed down).",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

Perilaku berulang ini umum dilakukan pada masa kanak-kanak yang biasanya dimulai dan berhenti secara spontan. Diketahuinya hubungan kebiasaan buruk oral (bad oral habits) dengan kejadian karies pada anak usia pra sekolah melalui hasil-hasil penelitian. Penelitian ini adalah studi literatur, dengan menganalisis dan menyimpulkan berdasarkan dari penelitian yang sudah ada. Dari hasil yang dihimpun peneliti data yang diperoleh adalah bad oral habits cukup banyak dijumpai pada anak pra sekolah. Dari 5 penelitian tersebut dengan jumlah sampel 4806 anak, sebanyak 1227 anak (25,5%), yang paling banyak dimiliki oleh anak pra-sekolah adalah kebiasaan menggigit kuku/bibir/benda lain. Penyebab dari bad oral habits banyak faktor antara lain stres yang berlebihan, sekedar meniru sehingga menjadi kebiasaan, bosan, lelah, frustasi, tidak senang, tidak aman, atau ketika tertidur lelap, dapat juga terjadi pada anak dengan masalah perkembangan, kesulitan emosional, atau gangguan fisik, harapan orang tua yang tinggi sehingga berakibat pada kecemasan yang akhirnya melampiaskan pada kebiasan buruk tersebut. Dampak yang muncul/terjadi akibat dari bad oral habits adalah adalah maloklusi, gangguan berbicara, perubahan postur wajah, nyeri rahang, gigi abrasi, gigi atrisi, karies gigi, perubahan postur wajah dan gangguan terhadap interaksi sosial mereka terhadap orang lain. Semua bad oral habits memiliki hubungan yang mendukung untuk terjadinya karies, apabila kebiasaan tersebut tidak dicegah dan dihentikan.",

      "abstract": "Enuresis is defined as the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months in a child who is at least 5 years of age. The behavior is not due exclusively to the direct physiologic effect of a substance or a general medical condition. Diurnal enuresis defines wetting, whereas awake and nocturnal enuresis refers to voiding during sleep. Primary enuresis occurs in children who have never been consistently dry through the night, whereas secondary enuresis refers the resumption of wetting after at least 6 months of dryness. Monosymptomatic enuresis has no associated daytime symptoms, and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, which is more common, often has at least one subtle daytime symptom. Monosymptomatic enuresis is rarely associated with significant organic underlying abnormalities. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disabling illness characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors over which the patients have little or no control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between OCD and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE).In this case-control study, we evaluated 186 children aged 6-17 years old who were visited in the pediatric clinics of Amir Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. The control group included 93 healthy children, and the case group included 93 age- and sex-matched children with stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Then, the children's behavioral status was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.The difference in compulsion was significant (P = 0.021), whereas the difference in obsession was significant between the two groups (P = 0.013). The most common symptom in CKD children with compulsion was silent repetition of words.Compulsive and obsessive are more common in NMNE versus healthy children. The observed correlation between compulsive-obsessive and NMNE makes psychological counseling mandatory in children with NMNE.",

      "abstract": "Rabies is an acute neurological infection of humans and animals, caused by rabies virus and usually transmitted by animal bites. After an incubation period usually lasting weeks or longer, a variety of prodromal symptoms may occur. Encephalitic rabies (80% of cases) is associated with episodes of generalised arousal or hyperexcitability and hydrophobia, in which spasms involve the contraction of inspiratory muscles with swallowing. Paralytic rabies (in 20% of cases) is characterised by progressive lower motor neuron weakness. Laboratory investigations are important for confirming an ante mortem diagnosis of rabies. Cardiopulmonary and many other complications, including multiple organ failure, are common in aggressively managed rabies patients in critical care units. No effective therapy is available for rabies and survivors are uncommon. In contrast, preventative measures for rabies are highly effective after recognised exposures.La rage est une maladie neurologique aiguë affectant les personnes et les animaux infectés par le virus de la rage, lequel est généralement transmis par la morsure d’un animal. Des signes précurseurs peuvent apparaître après une période d’incubation de quelques semaines voire plus. La rage encéphalique (qui représente 80 % des cas) est associée à des épisodes d’agitation ou d’hyperexcitabilité et d’hydrophobie durant lesquels surviennent des contractions spasmodiques des muscles pharyngés lors de la déglutition. La rage paralytique (20 % des cas) se caractérise par une dégénérescence progressive des neurones moteurs inférieurs. Des analyses de laboratoire sont nécessaires pour obtenir confirmation ante-mortem d’un diagnostic de rage. Des complications notamment cardiopulmonaires ainsi que des défaillances de plusieurs organes sont fréquentes chez les patients atteints soumis à des traitements très lourds dans les services de réanimation. Il n’existe pas de traitement curatif efficace et les survivants sont rares. En revanche, les mesures préventives suite à une exposition avérée sont extrêmement efficaces.La rabia es una infección neurológica aguda que afecta a personas y animales, causada por el virus de la rabia y transmitida generalmente por la mordedura de un animal.

      "title": "PTSD in the Context of Malignant Disease",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is the most common type of status epilepticus and carries the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality (1). It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

It is an affective disorder occuring in the luteal phase (the time between ovulation to the onset of menstrual bleeding) of the menstrual cycle (MC). PMCs range from mild mood fluctuations, called Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) to severe mental and physical disturbances, called Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). The exact aetiology of PMCs is largely under-explored. Its diagnosis and management are often difficult.

      "abstract": "In a given year, approximately 2.4 million American adults, or about 1.1% of the population 18 years of age and older, have schizophrenia.1,2 Men and women are affected with equal frequency. A severe, chronic brain disorder, schizophrenia is characterized by an onset in early adulthood, a lifelong course, debilitating symptoms, deterioration in functional ability, and lack of social acceptability, making it among the most disabling, and economically catastrophic disorders.2 Symptoms appear in men in their late teens or early 20s, whereas women are generally affected in their 20s or early 30s.3 In the U.S., annual direct and indirect costs of the disorder total more than $62 billion.4\r\n\r\nFour symptom clusters have been observed in large groups of patients.5 Positive symptoms (psychosis) are correlated with hospital admission and a first-time diagnosis. Delusions are the most common psychotic symptom and occur in 65% of patients with schizophrenia.6,7 Hallucinations and disorganized thinking occur in approximately 50% of these patients. Auditory hallucinations are the most common sensory disturbance, but visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations may occur.8 Most patients experience a combination of delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorganization.6\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms represent a loss of affective responsiveness, verbal expression, personal motivation, enjoyment, social drive, or attention to the environment.9 All cognitive domains are also affected by the disorder, including attention, language, memory, and executive function.10 The combination of blunted, inappropriate, and odd expressions is the most common affective disturbance in schizophrenia.11 Depressive symptoms are the most common mood disturbance in schizophrenia.12\r\n\r\nIn 2002, direct annual health care costs were estimated at $22.7 billion for the U.S., $7.6 billion in other direct costs, and $32.4 billion in lost economic productivity and caregiver costs, for a total of $62.7 billion.4 Schizophrenia accounts for 2.5% of all health care expenditures, 25% of hospital beds, and 20% of all Social Security benefit days. 13 Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia, with alterations in neurotransmitter pathways (e.g., with dopamine) and enlarged sulci and ventricles found on brain imaging.14",

Male patients sexually abused in childhood or adolescence may present to the primary-care physician with specific interpersonal or developmental crises or with persistent depression, anxiety, or somatic complaints. The physician can serve a therapeutic role by validating the patient's experience and can provide the patient with information on the prevalence and consequences of male sexual abuse. Assessment of the impact of sexual abuse will rely on the sensitive and systematic evaluation of critical variables related to the abuse.

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

      "abstract": "Developmental stammering (DS, also known as idiopathic stammering or stuttering) is a disorder of speech fluency that affects approximately 0.75% to 1% of the populations of Great Britain, Australia and America,1–4 although a recent study puts the point prevalence figure at between 1% and 3% in the UK.5 Prevalence is generally thought to be similar amongst communities worldwide, although there have been occasional suggestions that this figure might be lower in countries where there is less pressure on verbal acuity.6 DS may be distinguished from neurogenic stammering, which can occur subsequent to neurological damage of various aetiologies (for example, stroke, tumour, degenerative disease) and psychogenic stammering, whose onset can be related to a significant psychological event such as bereavement. While a diagnosis of neurogenic stammering might be made in early childhood and adolescence, both neurogenic and psychogenic types are typically associated with an adult onset. DS is by far the most common form of stammering and usually develops in the pre-school years. The mean age at onset is 42, with 75% of cases beginning before the age of 6.1 However, occasionally, stammering onset may be seen as late as 12 or 13 years of age.\n\nA feature of DS is that complete recovery, either with or without therapy, is common before adolescence. Approximately 74% of all children diagnosed with stammering will cease to stammer by the time they reach their early teens, although the figure may be as high as 89% in young females.7 8 This latter statistic is consistent with the fact that while equal numbers of males and females are initially diagnosed with stammering, the sex ratio changes to around 4:1 (male:female) in the overall population. The poorest prognosis is for males who experience a later onset to their …",

Within gastroenterology, attention has focused on the increased frequency of abuse history, particularly for patients with refractory functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Furthermore, regardless of diagnosis, abuse history can impair health status and one's ability to cope with one's medical condition. Especially for patients with painful functional GI disorders resistant to usual treatments, the physician should inquire in a supportive manner about the possibility of a prior abuse history or other psychosocial traumas (e.g., major loss).

Ideally, the term should be used only for persons in whom such fantasies are acted out in actual behavior. Almost all such persons will be men. There is an overlap between the psychiatric diagnosis of sexual sadism (as behavior) and the concept of evil as the word is used in everyday parlance. The word evil is evoked generally when one comes to learn of (or witness) violent actions of such a nature as to horrify, shock, and disgust us. Evil corresponds, that is, to an emotional reaction when confronted with acts of a particularly horrifying and repugnant type. Violent sexual crimes involving torture of the victim are particularly likely to elicit this response. A common examplar of sexual sadism is the serial killer who experiences orgasm when murdering his victim. Sadistic sexual fantasies are noted in certain adolescents. In some of these the fantasies serves rehearsal for future sadistic sexual acts, especially in adolescents with callous-unemotional personality (who often emerge in adult life as psychopaths). Whereas therapy would usually fail even if such adolescents were brought to treatment early, there are others who experience sadistic sexual fantasies, but for whom these fantasies are ego-alien and disturbing. Patients of the latter type may be amenable to dynamic psychotherapy.",

Además, una mayoría de las personas que intentan suicidarse tiene más de un diagnóstico. Esto es especialmente cierto si se tienen en cuenta los trastornos subumbral del Eje II o el Eje I. La existencia de un trastorno explica en gran parte la asociación entre la mayoría de las variables socioeconómicas (sexo, matrimonio, nivel educativo) y la suicidalidad. Los trastornos depresivos son el factor de riesgo principal, riesgo asociado probablemente a un episodio actual justo antes del intento. La asociación con episodios depresivos de un trastorno de ansiedad o la existencia de rasgos impulsivos (trastorno de la personalidad del grupo B, abuso de drogas o ambos) aumenta el riesgo de actuación. La ideación suicida y los intentos de suicidio muestran curvas de comienzo paralelas con picos entre los 14-20 años de edad, con la existencia de un diagnóstico previo del DSM-III-R como un predictor poderoso. El número de trastornos asociados aumenta linealmente la probabilidad de intentar el suicidio y es el único predictor significativo de la mortalidad. Un tratamiento adecuado de los trastornos mentales podría reducir sustancialmente la suicidalidad.",

Most frequently, when his fantasies led him to anticipate such a situation, he simply stayed away from treatment. On the occasions in question, however, this was not possible and seizures supervened. The fantasy of anal penetration played a major role for this particular patient. This specific fantasy, however, is regarded as idiosyncratic and not necessarily relevant to the precipitation of seizures in any other individual. The critical factor which may be applicable to other cases appears to be a situation in which there is no other available resolution to intense mutually incompatible feelings.",

Diagnostic criteria for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2000; the American Psychiatric Association had previously established very specific diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Both diagnoses require 2 months of prospective symptom ratings, which can be accomplished using forms designed by individual clinicians or employing 1 of a number of validated instruments. The patient will need to provide a complete family and personal history of mental disorders and medical diseases. A thorough physical examination and certain basic laboratory tests should either identify or rule out many potential causes of the symptoms. The diseases, disorders or situations considered in the differential diagnosis of PMS and PMDD will depend on the woman's presenting symptoms. Many women with a bothersome or debilitating premenstrual disorder go undiagnosed, either because they do not report their symptoms to a clinician or because the clinician has difficulty diagnosing the disorder.",

Despite their value in identifying and evaluating sexual dysfunction, screening tools and questionnaires should never substitute for a thorough sexual, medical, and psychosocial history. For patients with multiple sexual dysfunction symptoms following cancer diagnosis or treatment (e.g., ED and low libido), further evaluation of these symptoms is always recommended prior to initiating therapy for cancer or sexual dysfunction. Whenever possible, the temporal association or causal relationship between the symptoms should be assessed. The sexual, medical and psychosocial history is an essential element in the basic evaluation and should be obtained in all patients presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction. The essential components of sexual function assessment in the male should always include: erectile response (onset, duration, progression, severity of the problem, nocturnal/morning erections, self-stimulatory and visual erotic-induced erections), altered sexual desire, ejaculation, orgasm, sexually-related genital pain disorders, and partner sexual function, if available.",

      "abstract": "espanolLa enuresis nocturna (EN) hace referencia a la incontinencia urinaria nocturna que tiene lugar al menos una vez al mes durante tres meses en ninos de edad igual o superior a cinco anos. La EN es mas frecuente en varones y suele tratarse de una EN primaria y monosintomatica. La EN primaria es aquella en la que no se ha logrado continencia minima de seis meses de forma previa. La EN monosintomatica no se asocia a sintomas nefrourologicos diurnos. La EN suele relacionarse con comorbilidades como el estrenimiento, trastornos del sueno o el TDAH. La predisposicion genetica, los antecedentes personales nefrourologicos y los trastornos psicosociales son algunos de los factores de riesgo en la EN del nino. El diagnostico es clinico y se basa en una historia clinica detallada, exploracion fisica completa y diarios miccionales y de ingesta. El diagnostico diferencial es muy amplio, englobando otras patologias como diabetes mellitus, infeccion de orina, enfermedades nefrourologicas, oxiuros y alteraciones neurologicas. Las pruebas complementarias no estan indicadas de forma rutinaria si la exploracion fisica es normal y no existen signos de alarma. El tratamiento debe individualizarse e incluye educacion sanitaria, terapia motivacional, dispositivos de alarma y farmacos. Los dispositivos de alarma son de eleccion y requieren implicacion del paciente y la familia. La desmopresina se prefiere en ninos con menos de tres noches mojadas a la semana, volumen miccional maximo diurno (VMMD) superior al 75%, edad superior a 9 anos o fracaso del sistema de alarma. El pediatra tambien debera abordar los problemas psicologicos y sociales que puedan derivarse de la EN. EnglishNocturnal enuresis (NE) refers to nocturnal urinary incontinence that occurs at least once a month for three months in children aged five years old or older. NE is more common in males and is usually a primary and monosymptomatic NE. Primary NE is one in which a minimum continence of six months has not been achieved previously. Monosymptomatic NE is not associated with daytime nephro urological symptoms. NE is often associated with comorbidities such as constipation, sleep disorders or ADHD. Genetic predisposition, personal nephro urological history and psychosocial disorders are some of the risk factors for NE in children. Diagnosis is clinical and is based on a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and voiding and drinking diaries. The differential diagnosis is very broad, encompassing other pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, nephro urological diseases, pinworms and neurological disorders. Complementary tests are not routinely indicated if the physical examination is normal and there are not warning signs. Treatment should be individualized and includes health education, motivational therapy, alarm devices, and drugs. Alarm devices are of choice and require patient and family involvement. Desmopressin is preferred in children with less than three wet nights per week, maximum voiding volume during day-time (MVVDT) greater than 75%, age greater than 9 years, or failure of the alarm system. The pediatrician will also need to solve psychological and social problems that may result from NE.",

Carbamazepine (600 mg) was discontinued due to a lack of response. She improved significantly with supportive therapy. Various neuropsychological conditions, pelvic pathology, medications, etc., have been associated with this disorder. Pharmacologic strategies have included the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and analgesics. Validation, psycho-education, identifying triggers, distraction techniques, and pelvic massage have been tried. Living with PGAD is very demanding.

We tested a selected group of 50 men who were diagnosed with a depressive disorder and whose antidepressant treatment lasted for at least 24 weeks. These patients reported long-term delayed ejaculation or, in some cases, anejaculation as comorbidity. The results showed significant Spearman's correlation between elevated prolactin levels and intravaginal ejaculation latency values (R = 0.45), as well as between Beck's Depression-II inventory and intravaginal ejaculation latency and latency values (R = 0.48).",

      "abstract": "Poststroke depression (PSD) is a relatively frequent psychiatric comorbidity with prevalence rates ranging between 30% and 50%. Typically, PSD tends to occur between the third and sixth month following a stroke and may be identical to primary major or minor depressive episodes. However, some elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) with bilateral silent or overt subcortical strokes may present a different type of depression in which depressed mood is associated with cognitive disturbances with impairment of executive functions, psychomotor retardation, poor insight, and impaired activities of daily living. This type of PSD is known as vascular depression. Stroke and depressive disorders have a bidirectional relation, whereby not only are patients with stroke at greater risk of developing a PSD, but patients with a history of depression are at greater risk of developing a stroke. This relation is mediated by the existence of common pathogenic mechanisms operant in both conditions, which include anti-inflammatory processes, a hyperactive hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis that can result in a hypercoagulable state, as well as cardiac disturbances. The presence of PSD is associated with a worse recovery of activities of daily living, cognitive disturbances, and a higher mortality risk. Thus, early identification of PSD is of the essence so that treatment can be started without delay.",

      "title": "A Case of Musical Hallucinations in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aims: New onset psychosis in the elderly is rare with lifetime prevalence rates of 0.3–1%. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1–0.5% of the elderly, however more common causes of new onset psychosis include dementia, delirium, drug-induced psychosis, and primary psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression. More than 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience psychotic symptoms and 70% develop delusions, in particular, persecutory type. Visual hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination occurring in 80% of patients with Lewy Body dementia. Second person auditory hallucinations occur in schizophrenia-like psychosis, however musical hallucinations where one perceives music without an external source are rare. Methods: An 84-year-old female patient with no psychiatric background reported a 2-month history of musical hallucinations, causing distress and poor sleep. Patient denied hearing voices and other modalities of hallucinations. The musical hallucinations were not lateralised to either ear or side of space but experienced as external. Delirium was ruled out and patient’s medications were screened for anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics. Patient had good cognition and a CT head excluded organic causes. The patient appeared distracted by the musical hallucinations, however, was not agitated and her mood was euthymic with congruent affect. No evidence of mood disorders ruled out psychotic depression and other affective disorders with psychotic symptoms. No thought disorders or delusions were present. Antipsychotics quetiapine and amisulpride proved no benefit for the patient. Results: The patient’s presentation showed no clear reversible pathology and was unresponsive to antipsychotics. Musical hallucinations was given as a diagnosis of exclusion. A musical hallucination is a type of auditory hallucination involving the perception of music without an external source. Patients are usually female, over 60 and subdivided into those with hyperacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication. Our patient was female and over 60 with presbycusis. Musical hallucinations are proposed to be due to abnormal autonomous activity in the auditory brain systems responsible for normal music imagery. Sensory auditory deprivation or acquired peripheral deafness leads to impoverished auditory input and spontaneous activity occurs within the network for the perception and imagery of music. Conclusion: This case report describes a rare phenomenon of musical hallucinations in an elderly patient. It identifies important diagnoses to exclude including delirium, dementia and other organic causes. The patient was female, over 60 yrs and diagnosed with presbycusis, characteristic of patients with musical hallucinations. The patient showed no improvement with antipsychotics and so treatment consisted of psychoeducation.",

The merits of the method are not only due to the beneficial effects of the relaxant itself; the anaesthetic, that is invariably administered at the same time, plays an essential part in the procedure. Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

      "abstract": "A atividade sexual satisfatória é um dos pilares da qualidade de vida, envolvendo das preliminares ao intercurso sexual, mecanismos neurológicos, vasculares, endocrinológicos, musculoesqueléticos, psicossociais, culturais, além do parceiro sexual e fatores individuais (autoestima, imagem corporal e habilidade pessoal). A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

El masoquismo sexual constituye una psicopatologia escasamente prevalente en muestras psiquiatricas, planteando en el profesional de la salud mental diversos interrogantes etiopatogenicos, nosologicos y terapeuticos a la hora de atender a un paciente con dichas caracteristicas clinicas. Caso Clinico. Se expone el caso de una mujer adulta joven, con antecedentes por abuso sexual infantil, que desarrollo a partir de la adolescencia temprana fantasias sexuales recurrentes, de contenido exclusivamente masoquista. Tras la implementacion de psicoterapia ambulatoria, se evidencio una reduccion parcial de esta psicopatologia a nivel cognitivo, abandonando la paciente las relaciones sexuales sadomasoquistas que comportaban un potencial lesivo. Conclusiones. El masoquismo sexual representado por fantasias y conductas recurrentes, restrictivas, incontrolables y potencialmente lesivas reviste significacion clinica. El abuso sexual infantil se erige en un factor de riesgo para este subgrupo de sujetos masoquistas. Es necesaria una mayor investigacion empirica, con muestras clinicas, para poder determinar la validez externa de los hallazgos obtenidos",

Approximately 20-60 per cent of elderly in-patients are afflicted with transient confusion states during hospitalisation, and in more than 50 per cent of cases this escapes the notice of the attending physician. The disorder is characterised by a remarkably poor prognosis; even among those whose confusion state is transient, 20-30 per cent die before discharge, and approximately one third remain hospitalised. The occurrence of confusion in the elderly patient should alert the physician to the need of investigation to detect underlying severe disease without delay.

There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Many people suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, statistics showing that 1 in 3 people have their lives affected because of these worrying and annoying symptoms. One of the most common anxiety disorders observed in general medical practice and in the general population is the generalized anxiety disorder. In about 85% of cases, generalized anxiety does not appear alone, but is accompanied by other psychological problems, of which the most common are: depression, other anxiety disorders, substance abuse, digestive problems, etc. The patient diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) usually has suffered from severe anxiety and worries about several different areas of their life for at least six months. It occurs in 5-9% of the population, and the incidence is twice as high in women as in men. Generalized anxiety usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood. GAG is caused by several factors: 30%-50% of it can be genetic in nature, but it also can be caused by experiences during childhood, recent stressful life events, unrealistic expectations about others and oneself, conflicts in relationships, alcohol consumption, coping skills and other factors (Ciubara et al., 2018). Studies show that the anxiety levels in the general population have risen over the past 50 years - probably due to declining social cohesion affecting communities, unrealistic expectations for quality of life, excessive focus on negative news, and other factors, social and cultural aspects.",

Surface electromyography of the mentalis muscle demonstrated a tremor frequency of 8 Hz ([Video 2]). Quivering chin syndrome is a rare movement disorder. It may be sporadic or inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance with locus on chromosome 9(9q13-q21). These involuntary, paroxysmal, rhythmic, movements of the chin and/or lower lip may last from seconds to hours.[1] Episodes occur spontaneously or may be precipitated by stress and emotion. Usually no treatment is required. When indicated, injection of low-dose botulinum toxin into the mentalis muscle or low-dose clonazepam may be helpful.[2] Recognition of this rare entity is important to avoid unnecessary investigations.",

THE SENSORY DISTURBANCES IN PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURIES The sensory disturbances in peripheral nerve injuries do not always go hand in hand with severity of the injury. This probably depends on the anomalies often present in sensory distribution, anastomosis (especially between median and ulnar) and the location of nerver supplying adjacent areas.

The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common condition in which a traumatic event is persistently re-experienced in the form of intrusive recollections, dreams or dissociative flashback episodes. Cues to the event lead to distress and are avoided, and there are symptoms of increased arousal. To meet the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5), the full symptom picture must be present for more than one month, and the disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other areas of functioning [1].",

      "abstract": "A human being is a psychosomatic entity, an inseparable mind/body unit. Psychosomatic illness is caused by a break of this vulnerable internal equilibrium from important emotional perturbations provoked by experiences of abuse. Patients rarely consult their physician for abuse they suffered, and they often keep it a lifetime secret. Moreover, since there is a latency period between the abuse and the emergence of physical symptoms, neither the physician nor the patient realize how past abuse and present symptoms are related. Symptomatic treatment cannot treat the root pathologies and thus, psychosomatic illnesses most commonly become chronic.",

Lack of mutual consent is present in all sexual assaults. Post-traumatic symptoms occur immediately and for a large percentage of victims this trauma is not integrated for many years. Symptoms include the classic triad of post-traumatic stress symptoms of haunting, intrusive recollections, numbing or constriction of feelings and focus and lowered threshold of anxious arousal subsequent to experiencing intense fear, terror and loss of control. Long term effects include anxiety, depression, phobic reactions to situations reminiscent of the sexual assault, sexual dysfunction, impaired social adjustment and diminished capacity to enjoy life. Post-traumatic stress responses, symptomatology, psychodynamics and management of the victim of recent and nonrecent sexual assault are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Somatization disorder (SD) is a syndromatic classification that allows a physician to identify more easily patients with a lifelong history of chronic subjective physical complaints that are unverified by objective examinations either at the time of initial presentation or during the subsequent five years. The somaticizing process is believed to be an expression of emotional distress. The most common complaints of SD patients include recurrent pain (site and quality vary), conversion (pseudoneurologic) symptoms, nervousness or depression (or both), sexual and marital discord, and, often, menstrual difficulties. Such patients will generally have a history of repeated hospitalization or surgery. These symptoms are not perceived as mild or unimportant but lead to physician consultation, prescription drug use, and modification of life-style. Such patients are prone to \"doctor-shopping\" and self-medication and are at risk for many iatrogenic illnesses. Because they generally are resistant to psychologic explanations for their condition, management aimed at protecting them from the consequences of their behavior is important. A heightened threshold for instituting aggressive diagnostic and treatment procedures is necessary.",

The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo-graphic factors must be taken into account.

Effective treatment is possible in a busy primary care setting; therapy involves patient education and pharmacotherapy. Once other potential causes of symptoms of an anxiety disorder have been ruled out, the first step is to reassure the patient that he or she has a psychological condition-a very common one-and that symptoms are not the result of an undiagnosed disease or going crazy or losing control. Educate and inform patients that complete clinical remission is achievable, often with medication alone. Begin treatment on day 1 with a long-acting benzodiazepine-such as alprazolam XR or clonazepam-or with the anxiolytic agent buspirone; at the same time, start a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The anxiolytic agent allays acute somatic symptoms until the full effects of the SSRI are manifest (often 4 to 6 weeks). The anxiolytic can then be gradually tapered. Referral to a psychiatrist for psychotherapy may be indicated when a patient refuses or cannot tolerate drug therapy, or when response to therapy is inadequate.",

Menopozla ilişkili semptomların ana nedeninin kadınlarda östrojen düzeylerindeki kayıptan kaynaklandığına dair kanıtlar vardır. Menopoz genellikle sıcak basması, idrar bozuklukları, eklem ağrısı ve psikolojik sıkıntı gibi çeşitli sağlık şikayetleriyle ilişkilidir. Menopoz semptomlarını bildiren kadınların genel sağlık durumu genellikle daha kötüdür. Menopoz sırasında ve sonrasında birçok kadında depresyon (mutsuzluk, sinirlilik, ağlamaklılık, enerji eksikliği) veya anksiyete (ruh hali değişiklikleri, uykusuzluk, kalp çarpıntısı, panik atak, unutkanlık veya odaklanma ve konsantrasyon sorunları) belirtileri görülmektedir.

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "title": "Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder. The patient gave the authors informed consent to publish this letter.",

      "title": "The Occurrence of Funeral Mania After Bereavement: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Stressful or traumatic life events can lead to emergence of mood episodes. Events such as migration, relocation, job loss, bankruptcy, economic loss, divorce, natural disasters, accidental injury, or the loss of a loved one can trigger the first episode of bipolar disorder. After such life events, symptoms of depressive episodes often appear. Funeral mania, on the other hand, is defined as the emergence of manic episodes following the death of a close family member. Information on funeral mania, which occurs shortly after the loss of a loved one, is limited with a few case reports. In this study, a 26-year-old female patient who presented with the symptoms of a manic episode for the first time after her father's death and who had no previous psychiatric disease or treatment history was presented in the light of findings in the literature. It is noteworthy that the patient, who was followed up with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mania period) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, had a temporal closeness between her mood symptoms and her father's death, and had not developed such a reaction to previous traumatic life events. Therefore, the diagnosis was evaluated as funeral mania. It should be kept in mind that, although rare, symptoms of mania can be seen among possible grief reactions.Strese neden olan ya da örseleyici yaşam olayları duygudurum dönemlerinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilir.

Cenaze manisi ise, yakın bir aile üyesinin ölümünü takiben kişide mani dönemi belirtilerinin ortaya çıkması olarak tanımlanmıştır. Sevilen kişinin kaybından çok kısa bir süre sonra ortaya çıkan cenaze manisi ile ilgili bilgiler kısıtlıdır. Konu ile ilgili az sayıda olgu bildirimi mevcuttur. Bu çalışmada babasının ölümü sonrası ilk kez mani dönemi belirtileri ile başvuran, öncesinde herhangi bir psikiyatrik hastalık ve tedavi görme öyküsü olmayan 26 yaşındaki kadın hasta literatür bulguları eşliğinde sunulmuştur. DSM-5 tanı ölçütlerine göre bipolar bozukluk (mani dönemi) tanısı ile izlenen hastanın duygudurum dönemi belirtileri ile babasının ölümü arasındaki zamansal yakınlık olması ve önceki örseleyici yaşam olaylarına bu şekilde bir tepki geliştirmemiş olması dikkat çekicidir. Bu nedenle olgunun tanısı cenaze manisi olarak değerlendirilmiştir. Olası yas tepkileri arasında nadir de olsa mani dönemi belirtilerinin görülebileceği unutulmamalıdır.",

When the individual refuses to accept medical opinion and attributes the pain to a physical illness and persistently seeks diagnosis and treatment, then there is a possibility of an unexplained somatic problem. Depression, anxiety or even a personality disorder may be causative factors. The lack of studies of this type of disorder in the prison environment makes it difficult to fully evaluate the importance of this phenomenon for primary health care consultation in prison, despite the fact that the number of presented unexplained somatic complaints may well be the same as in the community (around 15%). Management of this type of patient is always difficult, complex and emotionally demanding for the health care professional.",

PMS results from ovulation and appears to be caused by the progesterone produced following ovulation in women who have enhanced progesterone sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity may be due to neurotransmitter dysfunction. Treatment is aimed at suppressing ovulation or reducing progesterone sensitivity.

Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose‐response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo‐graphic factors must be taken into account.

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC. Sin embargo, en la mayor parte de los casos las crisis no provocadas se presentan en ninos en los cuales no LOS EXPERTOS RESPONDEN Arch Pediatr Urug 2002; 73(4): 233-235",

      "title": "PROGNOSIS IN MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSES",
      "abstract": "A follow-up study of 208 manic-depressive conditions is reported. Analysis of such conditions permits the following summary. Positive heredity is common—chiefly depressions, and more commonly in the direct line of heredity. This shows more consistently in the manic cases. Characteristic personality type is outgoing. Unexplainable psychosis is rare (20 per cent). Most have disturbing circumstances at the time of onset. Oldest and youngest siblings may more frequently develop psychoses. Somatic handicaps frequently contribute to or help to precipitate the illness. Abrupt onset is rare except in manics. The condition usually requires one to six months to develop. Suicidal risk or attempt occurred in 30 per cent of all cases. The affective picture is often mixed, not purely as sadness or elation. Psychoneurotic (not often as anxiety), schizophrenic, and arteriosclerotic components are frequent (79 cases). (33.1 per cent). Thinking disturbances are present in one-fourth of the cases (manic and depressive phases). Capacity for rapport is fair or good in 41 per cent of the manics and in 70 per cent of the depressions. Some insight is present in 47 per cent of the manics and in 54 per cent of the depressions. Remissions of 10-20 years are common (67 cases, 32.2 per cent). Depression may begin early, but rarely (3.8 per cent, 8 cases), or late (65+, 11 cases, 5.2 per cent). The largest incidence occurs in the decade 45-55. Course is a matter of months; on the average 2½ months in the hospital. Three-fourths of the cases are well or improved at the time of discharge; 93 per cent recover from the first attack. Chronic cases are rare (16, 7.7 per cent). Cyclothymic cases tend oftener to chronicity. Single attacks are rare (21 per cent). Recurrence is likely. Long-term follow-up convinces us that caution is necessary in pronouncing recovery for the future. Seventy-nine per cent had recurrences. This is particularly true for cyclothymic cases. Many variations in course and phases occur. Depression following elation is more common than vice versa. Depression almost always lurks behind elation. Manic patients may suicide. Depressive or paranoid content occurred in 14 of the manic cases (77.7 per cent). Depressive cases may show definite manic features (spurts of elation in the morning, rhyming and flight with sadness). Single attacks of manic psychosis are very rare. Single attacks of depression occurred in 40 cases (19.2 per cent). Fourteen of these became chronic (35 per cent of 40 and 6.8 per cent of 208). The unfavorable depressions may develop a schizophrenic picture. Deterioration may occur in depression. Stupor in depression occurs—catatonic in appearance. First attacks on the average last 6½ months. Recovery from first attack is almost invariable (93 per cent). Twenty-one per cent had single attacks; 79 per cent had recurrent illnesses; 63.5 per cent had third attacks, and 45.1 per cent had fourth attacks. Attacks tend to become prolonged as they recur, especially after 45. Best prospect for recovery for patients having first attack is between 21 and 30, poorer after 40, worst after 50. Recovered patients show small number of attacks (2.7) and shortening of the course in subsequent attacks. The more frequent the attacks, the less chance for ultimate recovery. Depth of psychosis is not significantly important. Negative heredity is not an outstanding factor in recovery. Out-going make-up is a factor in recovered cases.",

While the majority of women experience the “baby blues” as a result of hormonal fluctuations, postpartum depression symptoms persist, are more severe in nature, and require medical intervention. Baby blues are characterized by mood lability and sudden crying but most commonly last a few days and then resolve. Up to 70 percent of women experience a few days of baby blues which then resolves completely. Most women with PPD develop symptoms within four weeks of giving birth, though symptoms can occur anytime within the 12 months following delivery. Approximately 15 to 25 percent of women experience PPD following childbirth. Postpartum depression can occur as a result of a live birth, spontaneous abortion, elective termination, or a fetal demise. In the United States 2 million new mothers experience PPD annually. Certain factors reduce the risk of PPD, including adequate social support, regular sleep patterns, and breastfeeding.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Koro syndrome is a culturally related disorder characterized by intense anxiety that the penis (vulva or nipples in females) is shrinking or retracting and will recede into the body. Usually it occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, being extremely rare in western countries. The condition is more common in males and is classified within Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders. Case report A 27-year-old single man was referred to the psychiatric department. By the age of 23, he began worrying that his penis was shrinking and retracting into the abdomen. He described these thoughts as intrusive, ridiculous and repetitive. During the first months the thoughts were not very disturbing but he progressively developed an urge to verify the length of his penis several times a day. To diminish the anxiety provoked by the obsessive doubts on penis length, he started to have repetitive thoughts and mental images about sexual acts, to consume pornography compulsively and to increase his masturbatory behaviors (from some times a week to several times a day). He described those thoughts and behaviors as unpleasant and uniquely driven to reduce anxiety provoked by obsessions. He was prescribed fluvoxamine 200 mg/day and initiated cognitive behavioral therapy with good response. Y-BOCS score decreased from 30 at initial evaluation to 18 after 3 months of treatment. Conclusions Koro syndrome is a very rare condition in psychiatry in western countries, usually presenting secondarily to other psychiatric disorders. Awareness of this diagnosis and knowledge on its management are critical to provide optimal care to patients.

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "abstract": "Experimental evidence has shown that acute injury in adult animals leads to pain that persists well beyond the period of healing. The underlying mechanism of this persistent pain, lasting weeks or months, is a maladaptive change in the processing of sensory information induced by injury. Thus, subsequent stimuli are abnormally perceived and behavioral responses are highly exaggerated. A similar process occurs in the neonatal animal, which has a functional sensory system and is extremely sensitive to cutaneous stimulation. Superimposing an injury on a neonate will lead to a state of persistent hypersensitivity. Neonatal circumcision may lead to long-lasting alteration of sensory perception and possibly other behavioral disturbances. The risk of long-term changes in behavior outweighs the perceived benefits of circumcision.",

In no branch of medicine is a good history more important than in neurology. It makes all the difference in the diagnosis of a difficult case in which the physical signs may not be in doubt. Time spent on it is well worth while. The poor witness can be helped by leading questions. After taking the detailed history it should be possible to list the probable site or sites of the nervous system affected, from muscle to cerebral cortex. Also, from the course of development of the symptoms (for example, whether episodic or progressive), it should be possible to suggest the likely pathological diagnosis. For example, vascular lesions tend to cause sudden or episodic symptoms; cerebral tumours more often cause slowly progressive symptoms.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

      "title": "HYSTERICAL PSYCHOSIS",
      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

      "abstract": "Vulval disorders have an impact on the psyche and emotional state that can be much more important than with other diseases. This kind of upset has the potential to cause worry and anxiety, which have a significant impact on patients, their partners and their relationships. Women have a wide variety of responses when dealing with their own vulval pathology, which can range from apathy, ignoring neoplastic lesions for many years, to great anxiety about mild and benign symptoms. During the consultation with a patient with vulval symptoms, the physician should take note of nonverbal signs exhibited by the patient, which may indicate anxiety or other psychological issues. Questions about sexual satisfaction and desire can give valuable information and this could lead to the discovery of personal unresolved problems such as conflicts with the partner or preconceptions about their problem.",

      "abstract": "To gain new insights into the clinical presentation, causes, treatment and prognosis of epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), and to develop hypotheses to be tested in a prospective investigation.In this retrospective multicenter study, all cases were included that fulfilled these criteria: constantly repeated fragments of epileptic seizures, with preserved consciousness, lasting ≥ 1 h and representing locally restricted motor or sensory epileptic activity. Single episodes were included when they lasted for a minimum of 1 day. EPC with Rasmussen syndrome and acute stroke were excluded.Three time courses with two subtypes each were distinguished, that is, EPC as a solitary event (de novo or in preexistent epilepsy); chronic repetitive nonprogressive EPC (with frequent or rare episodes); and chronic persistent nonprogressive EPC (primarily or evolving out of an episodic course). These were unrelated to etiologies (morphologic lesions 34%, inflammatory 29%, systemic disorders 9%, idiopathic 5%, unknown 23%). Precipitation and inhibition of seizures is a frequent feature of EPC. Levetiracetam and topiramate have improved the possibilities for pharmacotherapy. Topiramate seems to be particularly effective with dysontogenetic etiologies.The existence of several clearly distinct courses of nonprogressive EPC is a new finding. These distinctions will be further investigated in a prospective study with precise protocols for electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, and other studies. This should better establish the relation of motor and somatosensory EPC; further clarify the relations, pathogenesis, and significance of the different types and their etiologies; and possibly identify more semiologic variants. It should also provide more precise knowledge about therapy and modification of ictogenesis by external stimuli.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "abstract": "Rehabilitation in psychiatry is still associated with a more complete reestablishing of chronic patients' position in the society. However, early rehabilitation does not seem to resolve all the problems. Social losses and social deterioration are found in more than half of schizophrenic patients already in prodrome phase i.e. before the onset of the first psychotic episode. Further on, every relapse, several months of disease and hospitalizations frequently disrupt education, cause losing jobs and breaking relations, social withdrawal and also disability. Environmental and social factors may facilitate the development of chronic conditions and increasing defect via their interaction with the personality and the disease. Not infrequently the rehabilitation process may lag behind and certain possibilities may be missed. There is also a gap between the rehabilitation concepts and sociopsychological characteristics of specific age groups of psychiatric patients. The author presents the concept of psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) using schizophrenic patients as an example and emphasizes the following aspects: 1) PSR in an essential component of care on every stage that follows treatment, throughout the whole course of disease; 2) psychosocial interventions and social support are aimed at both preserving social capacities of the patient and prevention of social losses in future; 3) complex therapy in combination with consequent psychosocial (both group and individual) patient-centered interventions involving also family and social network of the patient is used along with other methods of social recovery; 4) with regard for the mentioned one can distinguish the most problematic patients groups, specifically: a) those in initial phase of disease (first 5 years), b) patients with frequent hospitalizations, c) those with unstable labor adjustment, d) single persons, e) those staying in hospital too long; and 5) in adolescence and in young age the purpose of rehabilitation is not only winning back the social positions but also restoration of the patient's personality and his social self; while in older age coping with negative effects of getting older and acceptation of new social roles are becoming more important.",

Williams1*, Bhuvanesh Awasthi1, 2, Paul F. Sowman1, 2, Matthew S. Finkbeiner1, 2 and Anina N. Rich1, 2 1 Macquarie University, Cognitive Science, Australia 2 Macquarie University, Centre for Cognition and its Disorders, Australia Visual perseveration is an unusual pathology that results in visual persistence of images in the absence of the original stimulus. There is often a short delay between the visual stimulation and the corresponding mental image or internal representation. The mental image usually disappears within seconds, although it may persist for several minutes and in some cases for much longer. Here we present a case of a young male, M, presenting with severe long-term visual perseveration of unknown eitiology who performs normally on all previous clinical examinations. His images often persist for several minutes and cause major disruption to his life. The onset occurred in his late teens but there is no known trauma. Structural MRI scanning revealed no obvious neurological damage. We performed Magnetoencephalograhy (MEG) while presenting spatially filtered face and house stimuli to assess the integrity of magnocellular and parvocellular pathways within the visual system. The magnocellular pathway is dominated by low spatial frequency (LSF) information and is faster than the parvocellular pathway, which processes high spatial frequency (HSF) information. This revealed an unusual pattern: M’s M170 was greater for HSF than LSF faces, whereas the opposite was evident in normal controls. In addition, M showed no difference in his M170 to HSF and LSF places whereas controls showed a greater response to HSF places than LSF places. We speculate that this atypical neural response to differing spatial frequencies reflects a mismatch in the information processing in these two pathways, resulting in M’s visual perseveration.

      "title": "The Urodynamic Assessment of Adult Enuresis",
      "abstract": "Urodynamic analysis has revealed a high proportion of uninhibited bladder activity in adult enuresis. There was no associated neurological deficit to explain this abnormality. There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a premenstrual syndrome comprising physical and psychic symptoms. Bipolar disorders, particularly \"soft\" forms, share symptoms such as depressive mood, irritability or mood reactivity with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, posing challenges on differential diagnosis. In the present work a case of a woman suffering from cyclothymia is reported, with mood episodes confined in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Case Report. A 42-year-old married Caucasian woman is presented, suffering from mood disorder episodes lasting for 10-12 days each, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and remitting after the beginning of her menses. The mood episodes occurred since the age of 20, in almost every menstrual cycle. The patient described hypomanic symptoms during the first 4-5 days of the luteal phase, reporting irritable mood, pressured speech, increased libido as well as vividness of her perceptions and excessive goal-directed activity. The hypomanic symptoms were followed by irritable and depressive mood, fatigue, hypersomnia, tearfulness, decreased self-esteem and pessimism, lasting for another 6-7 days. The patient also reported migraine and binge-eating episodes during each depressive phase. A full range of examinations, including blood and hormonal tests, yielded normal results. Lamotrigine was titrated at 200 mg/day, with subsequent amelioration of symptoms. The exact relationship between premenstrual dysphoric disorder and other disturbances, which either coexist, or deteriorate premenstrually, or even synchronize with the menstrual cycle, has not been elucidated yet. Studies aiming at a better understanding of this relationship could aid at accurate diagnosis and treatment.",

The purpose of this paper is to present hoarseness as an unrecognized symptom of premenstrual tension, briefly to describe this entity, to discuss the mechanism accounting for vocal huskiness and loss of vocal control, and to give clinical examples. Premenstrual tension is characterized usually by a feeling of pelvic discomfort, varying degrees of edema with a temporary weight gain of 4-10 pounds or more, unreasonable emotional outbursts, restlessness, and irritability. It is sometimes characterized by painful turgidity of the breasts and occasionally by recurring migraine, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbated dermatoses, and allergic rhinitis. Psychotic episodes and epileptoid seizures have been reported as rare symptoms. The etiology of premenstrual tension is unknown.

The severe and predominantly psychological form of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The exact aetiology of PMS is not known. PMS results from ovulation and appears to be caused by the progesterone produced following ovulation in women who have enhanced sensitivity to this progesterone. The increased sensitivity may be due to neurotransmitter (mainly serotonin) dysfunction. The key diagnostic feature is that the symptoms must be absent in the time between the end of menstruation and ovulation. Prospective symptom rating charts are used for this purpose. Treatment is achieved by suppression of ovulation or reducing progesterone sensitivity with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. In this chapter, the authors describe the aetiology, symptoms, diagnosis and evidence-based management of premenstrual syndrome.",

It is defined as a lack of adequate voluntary ejaculatory control with the result that a patient climaxes involuntarily. An ejaculatory control may be said to be established when the patient can tolerate high levels of excitement which characterise the plateau stage of the sexual response cycle without ejaculating reflexly. The most effective treatment for premature ejaculation so far is the stop-start exercises that aim to help patients tolerate a prolonged period of intense pleasurable arousal and to enjoy sexual sensation before ejaculation. However, the stop-start exercises would be more effective if they are employed in a multi-modal therapeutic framework. This is because cases of premature ejaculation differ in terms of the aetiology, pathological patterns, and the patients' personal characteristics and background. A case is presented to illustrate how the conventional stop-start exercises are prescribed in this multi-modal framework.",

Great care is needed here as patients may discuss such experiences for the first time and such disclosures arouse considerable emotion. Useful tests to investigate underlying problems are available. The phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil has revolutionized treatment of men with erectile difficulties of physical or psychological origin. Hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women is the main physical treatment that will enhance sexual function through its action on the vaginal epithelium and the vulval and clitoral erectile tissues.",

Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

This symptomatology presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician. Its cause may be primarily psychiatric or secondary to a somatic or neurological disorder. In this article, the case of an elderly woman presenting with typical partition delusions (the belief that something or someone exerts influence through impermeable structures) is described. This case illustrates the difficult differential diagnosis between primary psychiatric disorders and neurocognitive disorders with late-onset psychotic symptoms, as well as the discussion concerning the nosological classification of schizophrenia in the elderly population. At the end of the 20th century, the term ‘very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis’ was introduced for schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms developing after the age of 60. To this day, the validity of the existence and the etiology of this subgroup of schizophrenia remain a matter of debate. Psychosocial interventions are the first step in the treatment of late-onset psychotic symptoms. The use of antipsychotics is reserved for persistent, severe and debilitating symptoms because of the many side effects in the elderly population. However, the symptoms are often intrusive and have a negative impact on general functioning, so that drug treatment is regularly used in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexsomnia is characterized by sexual behaviors ranging from masturbation, sexual sounds, and verbalizations, to touching and full sexual intercourse during NREM sleep, with subsequent amnesia. Autonomic activation occurs with sexual arousal. Sexsomnia has been described mostly in adult males and is still an underrecognized condition. Treatment is often effective but without current consensus. In a case now reported of an adolescent male with sexsomnia, which is rarely reported in the literature, a novel feature that is now first reported is defecation accompanying sexsomnia as a co-occurring autonomic disturbance during sleep.",

A diagnosis of PMS is based on the timing and symptom pattern observed in daily symptom reports maintained by the patient. The etiology is unknown but is believed to involve genetic and dynamically evolving vulnerability, reproductive hormones, and neurotransmitters, as well as other brain processes. Effective medications have been identified for acute hormonal and symptomatic treatment of the disorder, but the time course and frequency of relapse and recurrence remain poorly understood. Further studies of PMS in all areas--etiology, pathobiology, diagnosis, course of illness, and treatment efficacy--are needed to increase the body of information about the menstrual cycle's effects on women's health and mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "Bucco-linguo-facial apraxia is a disorder in the performance of oral verbal and oral non-verbal gestures either to command or on imitation with often preserved ability to perform these same gestures outside the clinical setting in the appropriate situation or environment. The clinical and neuroanatomical correlates of this kind of apraxia in neurodegenerative disease are not well understood, though it is most often associated with lesions in the dominant hemisphere within the pre-frontal area. We describe the case-report of a 70-year-old right-handed woman with an isolated and slowly progressive bucco-linguo-facial apraxia without language disorders, speech articulation deficits or other cognitive impairment at onset. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain and complete battery of neuropsychological tests two times: at the baseline (onset) and after 3 years (follow-up). Baseline MRI of the brain was normal, but SPECT scan revealed decreased cerebral blood flow in the frontal and temporal lobes bilaterally, which was most marked in the left fronto-rolandic operculum. Clinical and neuropsychological examination showed moderate and isolated bucco-linguo-facial apraxia, without language disorders, speech articulation deficits or other cognitive impairment at onset. Long-term follow-up (3 years) showed a severe worsening of the bucco-linguo-facial apraxia, the development of speech production deficits (speech apraxia, dysarthria) and an evolution to muteness without perceptive language impairment, generalized intellectual deterioration or the appearance of other neurological signs. Follow-up MRI revealed a very mild enlargement of the cerebral ventricles but no signs of cortical atrophy whereas SPECT scan showed severe functional deficit and extension of hypoperfusion that paralleled the clinical worsening. We describe the very early stages and progression of what is probably a variant form of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes. No other cases characterized by an isolated bucco-linguo-facial apraxia at onset have been described in the literature. We propose the term Slowly Progressive Bucco-Linguo-Facial Apraxia for this peculiar syndrome, on the basis of its clinical presentation. This syndrome may be mistaken for similar syndromes, nonfluent primary progressive aphasia and the various frontal lobe dementias. Our findings confirm the crucial role of the left frontal operculum in bucco-facial praxis procedures in degenerative disorders and highlight the importance of functional neuroimaging in the early stages and follow-up of lobar dementias.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

In the pubertal period behavioural deviations and neuropsychic disturbances usually reach a degree of obvious pathology (psychopathies, psychogenias) in cases where a long-standing psychotraumatic situation is combined with unfavourable biological factors such as minimum brain deficit, severe and prolonged debilitating somatic disease, a shain of infections, and pathological heredity.",

      "abstract": "\"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders\" is a collective term that describes the continuum of disabilities, from mild to severe, accompanying the teratogenic effects of ethanol on the developing fetus. At the severe end of the spectrum is the subset of individuals with growth restriction, a distinctive pattern of facial dysmorphology, and cognitive and/or neurobehavioral effects (fetal alcohol syndrome), and at the mild end of the spectrum are those individuals with neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits who exhibit minimal or no growth or physical stigmata (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading cause of preventable developmental disabilities in the world. They occur much more commonly than previously recognized, with prevalence estimates from prospective school-based studies in the United States of 11.3–50.0 per 1000 children (~1–5%), and rates in special populations, such as the foster care system, as high as 169 per 1000 (~17%). An earlier diagnosis is associated with a better outcome and provides an opportunity to prevent the birth of another affected child in the family. Diagnosis, intervention, and prevention offer some of the greatest challenges to health care providers, families and their communities. Multidisciplinary diagnostic teams are available throughout North America and other parts of the world and can provide accurate and comprehensive assessments and management options for affected individuals. In this chapter, we discuss the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of children and adults with this common range of disabilities.",

Although most acute episodes of LBP are self-limiting, recurrent pain occurs in about 50–75% of individuals within 1 year. For the majority of patients, LBP is a chronic-recurrent problem and thus initial treatment recommendations should focus on long-term active approaches to health and well-being. Psychosocial and affective factors are the best predictors of an episode of acute LBP transitioning to a chronic pain state. These include depression, anxiety, trauma, social marginalization, passive coping, and fear. Exercise is generally the best supported treatment for LBP, although there are no real data to suggest that any one particular approach is uniquely beneficial. Excessive rest, unnecessary imaging, negative language, inaccurate and unhelpful diagnoses, excessive activity restrictions, and reliance on generally unhelpful or overtly harmful medications lead to iatrogenic disability and worse outcomes.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "1255 An Unusual Clinical Presentation of a Parasomnia",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry to sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. The non REM (NREM) parasomnias include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. In children, NREM parasomnias occur out of stage N3 (first part of the night) but in adults can occur out of stages N1 or N2 during any part of the night. We describe a case of NREM parasomnia with atypical clinical presentation. A 21-year-old female with history of depression and anxiety was evaluated for sleep terrors, sleep walking and sleep eating since age 5. Over the period of past 4 years, her sleepwalking subsided, and was substituted with hallucinations. Patient woke up with loud screams and hallucinations, “living the dream” and was able to explain it to her parents with her eyes open, who eventually “woke her up out of the episode”. Dreams were violent with “death” as the usual theme, approximately 2 hours after sleep onset with complete recollection after waking up. She also endorsed excessive daytime sleepiness with adequate sleep time on actigraphy. Patient denied history of head trauma, encephalitis, epilepsy or family history of sleep disorders. She was treated with Alprazolam and Sertraline in the past 3 years without improvement. She underwent a carefully conducted PSG and MSLT, which was negative for sleep disordered breathing or hypersomnia disorders. Extended Video EEG monitoring captured multiple stage 2 screaming and looking under the bed episodes with patient describing, “dead dogs around and under her bed”. No epileptiform activity was seen. Patient was started on Protriptyline HCL 10 MG twice daily, which resolved her symptoms. Sleep hallucinations are relatively common in teens and young adults, usually visual and reduce with aging. This case highlights an unusual presentation of hypnopompic hallucinations in stage 2, patient opening her eyes and being able to describe her hallucinations before she is “woken out of her sleep”. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of NREM sleep arousals vs. epileptiform activity. Latter was ruled out with an extended video EEG monitoring. It’s also interesting to note that her symptoms resolved with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which was used due to failure of SSRI and benzodiazepine therapy in the past. TCA use has been described to control sleep hallucinations in narcolepsy, our case delineates their possible use in NREM hallucinations.",

PSD has significant adverse consequences on the recovery of motor and cognitive deficits, as well as on the risk of mortality associated with stroke. The prevalence of PSD varies over time with an apparent peak 3-6 months after stroke and subsequent decline reaching about 50% of the initial rates at one year. The natural course of major depression after stroke has spontaneous remission typically 1 to 2 years after stroke. However, it has also been observed that depression becomes chronic and may persist for more than 3 years following stroke. On the other hand, minor depression appears to be more variable, with both short-term and long-term depression occurring in these patients. Early recognition of PSD symptoms and introduction of pharmacological treatment is of great importance in the reduction of stroke complications and stroke mortality as well as for better functional outcome.",

      "abstract": "Summary In normal trained dogs many trivial factors such as strangers in the laboratory, previous noise and confusion in the kennels, changes in the daily experimental routine, an unexpected change of experimenters, or the presence of a female dog in estrus may cause pronounced emotional disturbances resulting in marked and sudden elevation of blood pressure. The extent of the emotional blood pressure response depends upon the natural emotional reactivity of the animal and the degree of training, being most pronounced in highly trained animals. These factors must be considered in experiments on trained dogs when it is important to avoid emotional tension. It is possible that frequent daily repetitions of these emotional states may over a period of months or years lead to morphological changes in the kidneys and cardiovascular system with persistent elevation of blood pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the high degree of restraint and conditioning which are characteristic of the daily existence of the average human subject may eventually result in a similar state of irritability of the vasomotor centers so that minor changes in the daily routine or environment may lead to repeated and excessive acute blood pressure elevations and over a period of years become a factor in the genesis of certain types of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled sexual thoughts, urges, or behaviors, and was first described over 100 years ago. Although there is little consensus about definition or classification, CSB is generally thought to involve both paraphilic (e.g., pedophilia, voyeurism) and nonparaphilic (e.g., compulsive masturbation) forms. CSB has been estimated to affect as much as 5% of the United States population; 80%-90% of those with CSB are male. Onset occurs in the late teens or early twenties, and the disorder is generally chronic or episodic. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, particularly substance use and mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. Developmental, behavioral, neurobiologic, and sociocultural mechanisms probably play a role in the etiology of CSB and its expression. Treatment has not been well delineated, but individual psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and 12-step programs may be helpful. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help some patients regulate their sexual impulses, while anti-androgens may be helpful in sexually aggressive forms of CSB.",

      "title": "GELASTIC PRESYNCOPE: AN UNUSUAL MANIFESTATION IN AN ELDERLY PATIENT",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Laughter (gelastic) resulting in presyncope or syncope is a recognized, although rarely reported, cause of situational syncope. Characterized by an index event, laughter-induced presyncope or syncope persists and is amenable to behavioral modification. A case of recurrent presyncope precipitated by laughter in an elderly man and corrected using behavioral modification is presented. A 67-year-old man was seen in consultation for the complaint of near blackout spells with laughter. The first episode occurred while listening to a radio program while driving, when his laughing heavily resulted in blurring vision, darkening of visual field, feeling faint, and sensation of imminent loss of consciousness. He slowed his vehicle and pulled off the road, and the symptoms soon resolved. He denied complete loss of consciousness, uncontrolled movement of limbs, bowel or bladder incontinence, headache, or other associated symptoms. Since this index episode, patient reports recurrent episodes of near loss of consciousness associated with vigorous laughing. Episodes last only a few seconds. He had similar symptoms, but of lesser severity, in relation to straining during defecation and micturition. The patient denied any palpitations, irregular heartbeat, chronic cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, other systemic or constitutional symptoms, having had stroke in the past, any history of seizures, or any sleep disturbances, including any symptoms suggestive of narcolepsy or cataplexy. His medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prolonged posttraumatic disorder, which were stable. The patient was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging and a magnetic resonance angiogram of the brain, which showed only mild periventricular white matter changes that were nonspecific. Carotid Doppler studies were unremarkable. Chest X-rays were normal. No further diagnostic investigation was pursued because behavioral modification of avoiding vigorous prolonged laughter resolved his symptoms completely. Gelastic presyncope or syncope is a relatively uncommon type of neurally mediated event with a drop in systemic vascular resistance due to arterial dilation in the setting of a relative or absolute bradycardia. During prolonged laughter, there is repetitive Valsalva effect with reduced venous return secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure with associated systemic arterial dilatation and bradycardia resulting in reduced cardiac output and cerebral hypoperfusion. If the Valsalva effort is not aborted during the presyncopal phase, it is likely that it will culminate in a syncopal episode. This mechanism is similar to that seen with cough syncope. In addition, emotional factors and cerebral vasoconstriction secondary to systemic hypocapnia could be contributing to the syncope in this situation.1 This patient also had presyncopal sensations to straining from defecation and urination, suggesting Valsalva effect as the most likely mechanism. Laughter or gelastic syncope can potentially be misdiagnosed as cataplexy related to laughter. There have been only a few case reports of laughter syncope previously reported, mostly in the elderly population, in healthy adults and people predisposed to dysautonomia.1–4 Possible contribution of dysautonomic neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus can not be excluded in the current patient. A more-serious underlying mechanism of severe vascular disease involving the brachiocephalic trunk was noted to be the mechanism in the first reported case of laughter syncope.3 Syncope resolved after percutaneous angioplasty. Falls in elderly people can lead to devastating consequences, and hence it is essential to diagnose and prevent syncope in this age group. Beta-blockers and midodrine were noted to have beneficial effects in controlling symptoms in one described case of neurally mediated syncope.4 Behavioral modification may be the best initial approach before exposing the patients to medications.

      "title": "Perception of chronic pelvic pain in women: predictors and clinical implications",
      "abstract": "Pain is a complex subjective experience, associated with neurovegetative, affective and cognitive rapid changes. Biological, psychosocial and contextual factors may contribute. Chronic inflammation, of whatever cause, is the leading contributor to chronic pain. The mast cell directs both the inflammatory process and the shift to chronic pain, mediating through the production of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and other neurotrophic molecules. Women, in the fertile age, are biologically more vulnerable to chronic inflammation, as fluctuations of estrogens are agonist factors of mast cells degranulation, mostly in the premenstrual phase. Pain is defined as “nociceptive” when it indicates an ongoing damage; “neuropathic” when it becomes a disease per se. Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) indicates an invalidating, persistent or recurrent pelvic pain, persisting for more than 6 months. CPP is the main complaint of 10–15% of gynaecologic consultations, leading to 40% of diagnostic laparoscopies and 15% of hysterectomies. Comorbidity, i.e. the coexistence of pathologies and painful syndromes in different pelvic organs, is another common feature. Cystitis, vulvar vestibulitis, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome all play an important role and contribute to identifying the hyperactive mast cell and related chronic inflammation as the common pathophysiologic factor. The paper reviews nociception characteristics, the emerging role of mast cells, the pathophysiology of comorbidity, biological, psychosexual and contextual predictors, and stresses the need to move from a “hyperspecialistic” perspective to a multisystemic reading of CPP, with special attention to the urologic perspective.",

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

      "abstract": "Emergence delirium (ED) is defined as the delirium that occurs during the transition from the sleep state to full consciousness. ED increases the risk for injury, self-extubation, hemorrhages, and prolonged hospitalization and occurs in patients of any age but most often in children and elderly patients. However, ED in young adults is rarely reported. We presented a case of typical ED occurring in a young healthy man following an uneventful appendectomy. The causes of ED can be classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors. In this case, the unnoticeable mental stress may be the predisposing factor and the sevoflurane maintenance of anesthesia may be the precipitating factor. ED occurs at any age of patient and in any minor surgery, and anesthesiologists should do some work to prevent it from happening.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "title": "Management of Recurrent Depression in Primary Care",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a major depressive episode of recent onset. She had 2 previous episodes 1 and 3 years earlier, which had been treated by her primary care physician with fluoxetine for 6 months each time. There is no evidence of bipolar illness. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Major depressive disorder is a highly prevalent condition in the general population. Its chronic and recurrent nature is getting increasing attention [1]. Approximately 8 of 10 people experiencing a major depressive disorder will have 1 or more episodes during their lifetime, i.e., a recurrent major depressive disorder [2]. In some patients, the episodes are separated by many symptom-free years of normal functioning. For others, the episodes become increasingly frequent [3]. This latter course appears to be the more prevalent, both in psychiatric and primary care settings [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].Partial remission between episodes, not full recovery, appears to be the rule and is associated with residual disability [7]. At least 1 patient out of 3 is likely to relapse within a year [4, 5, 6]. Two major risk factors associated with relapse appear to be persistence of subthreshold or subclinical symptoms and number of episodes of major depression [4, 5, 6, 7]. As a result, for most people, depression is a life-long episodic disorder with multiple recurrences (averaging 1 episode in every 5-year period) [8].The adverse economic, interpersonal and medical consequences (e.g. work impairment, and family dysfunction) of the course of unipolar depression are considerable [1]. The case vignette thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or specialty settings. As our patient meets the criteria for recurrent depression developed by Frank et al. [10](≥3 episodes of unipolar depression, with the immediately preceding episode being no more than 2.5 years before the onset of the present episode), there is an 80–90% chance of relapse within 2 years from remission of depression and discontinuation of antidepressant treatment [10, 11].Since the chances of relapse are so high, the primary care physician would think of referral to a psychiatric specialist as the next logical step, relying on his/her clinical judgment for further therapeutic strategies. There is very little empirical support, however, that this choice, per se, entails substantial benefits for the patient. An impressive series of studies point to this conclusion.Simon et al. [12]compared the 6-month outcome in depressed patients receiving antidepressant prescriptions either from psychiatrists or primary care physicians. The proportion receiving antidepressant medication at an adequate dose for 90 days or more was similar in both cases (about 50%). The two groups showed similar rates of improvement in all measures of symptom severity and functioning [12]. Even collaboration between primary care physicians and mental health consultants [13]or implementation of clinical-practice guidelines and practice-based education [14]did not yield any significant advantage over usual care in long-term outcome.Three hundred eighty-six patients with recurrent major depression or dysthymia who had recovered after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment by their primary care physicians were randomized to a relapse prevention program (involving a depression specialist) or usual primary care [15]. There were no significant differences in the relapse rate over a 12-month follow-up period.What emerges from these studies is the failure of the mental health specialist to improve the outcome of major depression in the primary care setting [16]. The introduction of more tolerable and easy-to-use antidepressant drugs, compared with the traditional tricyclics (which required dosages that nonpsychiatric physicians were reluctant to use), has blurred the difference among physicians in prescribing antidepressant drugs. At the same time, an impressive amount of pharmaceutical propaganda has clouded the evidence which underlies clinical decisions [17]. The main therapeutic strategies are now described, taking into consideration the most reliable findings available.Maintenance pharmacotherapy has been advocated as an effective tool for reducing relapses and recurrences in major depression [18, 19, 20]. A number of studies have demonstrated the superiority of antidepressant drugs (mostly tricyclics) against placebo in protecting the patient from relapsing [18, 19, 20]. Their average duration was 17 months [21]and only one small trial of imipramine reached 5 years [22]. Viguera et al. [23]analyzed 27 studies with variable length of antidepressant treatment which reported follow-up on drug discontinuation. Duration of drug treatment did not seem to affect long-term prognosis once the drug was discontinued. In clinical terms, this means that it does not matter whether you have treated a depressed patient for 3 months or 3 years, when you stop the drug. Indeed, there was a statistical trend which suggested that the longer the drug treatment, the higher was the likelihood of relapse [23]. An observational study on 236 unipolar patients, who had received antidepressants during recovery and were followed for an affective recurrence for up to 5 years, showed that the rate of recurrence for patients with fewer than 5 previous episodes was not affected by medication after the initial 8 months [24]. While benefits of long-term drug treatment have been clearly shown only in outpatients with major depression, we cannot assume that these can be achieved in the milder, heterogeneous forms of depression in primary care [19, 25].If we then consider the case vignette in light of the evidence we have summarized, we reach the following conclusions. One might judge the time of treatment with an antidepressant used by the primary care physician (6 months) in the previous 2 episodes as being too short and expect a more favorable outcome with a longer course of treatment (1 or 2 years). Certainly, during that time, the patient would be more protected from relapse than being drug free, but this would not affect the outcome after discontinuation of the antidepressant drug [23]. The problem would simply be postponed (table 1). One might expect this strategy to be valuable at a time when the patient is particularly exposed to stressful life circumstances. In a controlled study [26], however, maintenance pharmacotherapy was not found to be protective against life stress.Another option would be lifelong pharmacotherapy with antidepressant drugs. This, however, is not easy to communicate to the patient. Not infrequently, the physician starts with a gradual approach (telling the patient it will be for 1 or 2 years, while meaning indefinitely). Andrews [27]raised the issue of being more honest with people with recurrent depression and the need of long-term pharmacotherapy. However, if 'people have a right to the truth' [27], they are also entitled to the full story [28].Even though lifelong pharmacotherapy is chosen (table 2), there is the common and vexing problem of relapse during pharmacotherapy [29]. The return of depressive symptoms during long-term antidepressant treatment was found to occur in 9–57% of patients in published trials [30]. Possible explanations include pharmacological tolerance, loss of placebo effect, increase in disease severity, change in disease pathogenesis, accumulation of a detrimental metabolite, unrecognized rapid cycling, and prophylactic inefficacy [30]. A number of pharmacological strategies have been suggested in uncontrolled and often small trials for addressing this loss of efficacy (increase or decrease in dose, augmentation, change to a different drug), but specific guidelines do not exist [30]. In the first and only large-scale controlled trial [31], about 1 patient out of 3 relapsed during a 3.5-month maintenance treatment with fluoxetine. Two of the 3 patients relapsing while on fluoxetine responded to a blindly determined double dose of fluoxetine. However, part of these patients (11% of the initial ones) relapsed again while on doubled fluoxetine, despite the relatively short follow-up [31]. The patient should thus be warned that loss of clinical effects during long-term pharmacotherapy does occur, despite adequate compliance. Increasing the dose could be effective (at least temporarily), but depression can also become treatment resistant. Results from one study [32]suggest that full doses are superior to lower doses in the maintenance phase. Lower doses, however, are less likely to produce side effects [32]and more likely to allow a successful response by increasing the dosage when there is a loss of clinical effect [29]. The occurrence of side effects such as weight gain or sexual dysfunctions [21]may undermine compliance and quality of life.Lithium has been found to reduce relapses in unipolar depression [33]. However, also with lithium, progressive loss of clinical effect has been reported [34, 35]. Certainly reemergence of depressive symptoms in allegedly unipolar depressed patient treated with antidepressants calls for reconsideration of differential diagnosis, with particular reference to milder forms of bipolar disorder [29].Recurrence of depression in the case vignette can also be managed by treatment of the new episode with the same or other antidepressant and discontinuation when remission ensues [36]. The appearance of prodromal symptoms generally precedes the full syndrome by weeks or months [36]. An early intervention upon relapse was found to significantly shorten the length of the depressive episode [37]. As a result, relatively frequent follow-up visits and education of patients and their family members to recognize the patient's characteristic prodromal symptoms (which appear to be similar across episodes of the same patient) may potentially increase the efficacy of this approach [36]. This treatment, which is in line with approaches to recurrent disorders in clinical medicine, requires the establishment of a good patient-doctor relationship and a lower degree of compliance compared with the long-term pharmacotherapy. It should also be observed that a substantial proportion of patients discontinue antidepressant therapy after responding to the initial acute phase of treatment, regardless of the physician's advise [38, 39, 40, 41].Two main disadvantages may, however, be present (table 1). One is given by the phenomenon of resistance [29]: the likelihood that a drug treatment may be associated with a diminished chance of response in those patients who successfully responded to it but discontinued it. This phenomenon was considered to be relatively rare. In a naturalistic 6-year follow-up of depressed patients where the intermittent pharmacotherapy was used and patients were treated with the same antidepressant of the initial episode, it was found to take place only in 4% of instances [42]. However, the first study which assessed the efficacy prospectively of reinitiating exactly the same treatment (fluoxetine) in patients who had a depressive relapse upon drug discontinuation [43], provided a different picture. Thirty-eight percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after reinitiation of fluoxetine. The second disadvantage has to do with discontinuation syndromes which may occur, particularly with SSRI, despite tapering [44, 45].The presence of residual symptoms, despite drug or psychotherapeutic treatment, has been strongly correlated with poor long-term outcome [7]. Further, some residual symptoms of major depression may progress to become prodromal symptoms of relapse [7]. This has led to the development of a sequential strategy based on the use of pharmacotherapy in the acute phase of depression and cognitive behavioral therapy in its residual phase [46]. In randomized controlled trials [11, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50], the various applications of this model have been found to yield a lower relapse rate in recurrent depression. Preliminary studies have suggested its usefulness also in atypical depression [51], bipolar disorder [52], and when loss of clinical effects occurs during long-term antidepressant treatment [53]. Its preventive effects appeared to be related to abatement of residual symptoms and/or increase in psychological well-being and coping skills. The practical steps for implementing this approach are described in table 2 and detailed elsewhere [46]. It may include discontinuation of antidepressant drug treatment, as outlined in table 2, or its maintenance. It may offer the advantage of yielding enduring effects while limiting the exposure to and costs of drug therapy. There are two main disadvantages (table 1). One is given by the fact that patients should be motivated to undergo a short-term (10–20 sessions) psychotherapeutic treatment while they are apparently well. The other is the fact that, while the other strategies may be pursued by a nonspecialist physician, implementation of the sequential approach requires referral to a specialized psychotherapist.Information is needed about several clinical issues surrounding recurrent depression.Attention has been called to the arbitrary nature of the distinction between treatment response associated with residual symptomatology and refractory depression [54]. At present, we do not know whether different antidepressant drugs may entail different rates of residual symptoms. What we know is that there may be differential remission rates, as was found to be the case for amitriptyline [55]and venlafaxine [56]. The question would be crucial in view of the role of residual symptoms in recurrent depression [54]. Similarly, we do not know whether combinations of antidepressant drugs, as they are used in treatment resistant depression [57], may yield a more pervasive recovery than a single antidepressant.Whether different antidepressant drugs or different dosages of the same antidepressant drug may engender different rates of loss of clinical effects is another crucial, unanswered clinical question [29]. At present, we have only one, large-scale, controlled study [31]on the effects of increasing the dosage of antidepressants. Other strategies, such as switching to a different type of antidepressant, have not been investigated in controlled studies [30]. We also need to know more about the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying tolerance to antidepressant drugs [58].Similarly, we do not know whether lack of response to an antidepressant which is reinstituted after a drug-free period in the same patient and which was found to be effective, may differ among drugs [54]. We also need to compare intermittent and continuation pharmacotherapy in controlled studies.Adding cognitive behavioral psychotherapy to the treatment package of recurrent depression was found to yield long-term benefits in terms of relapse rate [11, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50]. Both discontinuation and maintenance of pharmacotherapy have been used in the sequential approach, but have not been directly compared in controlled studies. Is there an advantage in keeping drug treatment after psychotherapy?Guidelines for the treatment of depression are available to clinicians. Both those developed by the American Psychiatric Association [59]and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Practice Guidelines [60], while providing evidence-based data on the management of the acute phase of depression, do not provide adequate discussion of the different strategies that recurrent depression entails. Evidence indicates that both antidepressant pharmacotherapy and time-limited depression-targeted psychotherapies are efficacious in primary care settings [59]. The Primary Care Guideline Panel recommended maintenance pharmacotherapy for patients with histories of 3 or more depressive episodes and vulnerability to future recurrences because of associated risk factors [60]. Guidelines for treating depression in primary care were developed also in Australia and New Zealand [61]. They suggested at least 2 years of continuation of pharmacotherapy for repeated episodes or where there were other risk factors for relapse [61].Hollon and Shelton [62]show how treatment guidelines for major depressive disorders understate the case for the empirically supported psychosocial interventions. Another important aspect in the development of guidelines is the issue of conflict of interest of those involved in them [63, 64, 65], which disclosure fails to correct [66].The World Health Organization ranked major depression as the fourth most disabling medical disorder by disability-adjusted life years, a measure of burden [67]. By 2010, World Health Organization projected, major depression will be ranked second unless meaningful improvements occur in prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The case illustrated in the vignette outlines the difficulties that prevention of depressive recurrences entails. On the basis of evidence available, the following approach is outlined.First, the patient should be offered adequate information about the prognosis of her depressive illness. It is unlikely that a new course of treatment with the same or similar antidepressant will favorably affect her condition. Andrews [27]remarks that many doctors are concerned that telling people the true prognosis will cause their depression to worsen. However, this very much depends on the content and modalities of the communication. In our Affective Disorders Program, we share with our patients that depression is likely to recur [28]. In the case vignette, we would tell her that depression is very likely to ensue again once antidepressant drugs are stopped. So, one option would be to continue with an antidepressant drug indefinitely. We would tell her, however, that also this option is not completely risk free, since loss of clinical effect may occur. The other option would be to start working on prevention of the next episode. For doing this, we would need to view depression not as something coming 'out of a clear sky', but as a result of a maladaptive lifestyle. Depressed patients are often unaware of the consequences of long-term minor life stresses, interpersonal friction, prolonged anxiety, excessive work, and inadequate rest [11]. It is ironic that, while psychiatrists tend to view prevention of relapse of depression purely in pharmacological terms, as if it were a disease such as diabetes [27], diabetologists, as other medical specialists, emphasize the importance of nonpharmacological strategies [68]. This second option is more difficult to pursue, but is likely to yield enduring effects. We would also explain to the patient that a longer course of treatment with an antidepressant drug this time would be unlikely to yield a better prognosis once the drug is discontinued [23]. In our clinical experience, patients generally look favorably to pursuing a treatment strategy that may provide long-term effects.If the patient described in the vignette accepted to try to pursue a sequential approach, we would treat her with the same drug that was used in the previous 2 episodes. If resistance occurs, we would switch her to a different type of antidepressant (a drug affecting both serotonin and noradrenaline, such as a tricyclic). After 3 months of treatment, we would reassess the patient carefully (table 2). Is she well or simply better? What is the level of residual symptomatology? Such an assessment may require both structured interviews and self-observation (diary). A helpful example which we make is the following. 'When we first saw you, you were very depressed. Driving the way you did, you went off the road. With antidepressant drugs, we did put you back on the road. Things are much better now. However, if you keep on driving the way you used to, you may end up off the road again, sooner or later' [46]. The example outlines the need for lifestyle modification and introduces a sense of control in the patient as to his or her depressive illness. This psychological preparation paves the way for subsequent psychotherapeutic approaches.The clinician could then refer the patient for a short-term (10–20 sessions) course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. This would be the psychotherapeutic approach of choice, since it has been specifically studied for its preventive effects [46]. We would be inclined to taper antidepressant drugs during the course of psychotherapeutic treatment (table 2). Tapering should be performed at the slowest possible pace, to minimize the risk of antidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes [21, 59]. There are no significant differences in relapse rates off medication between studies involving rapid discontinuation and those in which tapering was more gradual [23]. Slow tapering, however, may allow the detection of emerging symptoms in their prodromal phases, which may become the target of psychotherapeutic strategy [54]. Interventions that bring the person out of a negative functioning are one form of success, but facilitating progression toward psychological well-being is quite another [69]. This is an emerging area for psychotherapeutic research and practice [46, 69]. The advantages of maintaining the patient on antidepressant drugs are not clear, unless one aims to keep pharmacotherapy indefinitely and to use the addition of a psychotherapy only as a boosting strategy.A final aspect of the sequential approach lies in a careful assessment of the patient once both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy have been terminated. If improvement appears to have occurred, the patient can be seen at regular follow-up visits, geared not only to verify the presence of depressive relapses, but also to assess the subclinical symptomatology [7]. If substantial residual symptomatology persists despite clinical response or minimal or no benefits have been achieved by psychotherapeutic approach, then indefinite drug treatment can be discussed with the patient. In our clinical experience, however, the patient has gained a better psychological acceptance of a pharmacological approach. Whether this should be indefinite or intermittent (table 1), very much depends on the patient's preferences and the patient-doctor relationship (with ensuing opportunities for monitoring the patient). Clinical indicators for indefinite, instead of intermittent, drug therapy could be rapid onset of depression with suicidal ideations and the likelihood of severe discontinuation syndromes in a specific patient.Prevention of recurrence in major depression cannot simply be based on prolongation of ongoing pharmacological treatment. The evidence available suggests that the active collaboration of the patient (in choosing a treatment option, in lifestyle modification, in seeking treatment again when needed) is a crucial, and yet neglected variable. This can lead to a more rational use of antidepressant drugs and to therapeutic efforts of more enduring quality than those prevailing today [70].This paper was supported in part by grants from the Ministero dell' Università e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (MURST, Roma, Italy) to G.A.F. and N.S. and by a grant from the 'Mental Health Evaluation Project' (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Roma, Italy) to G.A.F.

Two stages of old age are currently recognized: early old age (65 to 75 years) and over 75 years - late old age period.

In many countries, number of the population over 65 years of age increases. The same applies for our country. Term of psychic disorders includes miscellaneous psychic conditions, pathologic in terms of symptom intensity, personality and social behavior changes, and reflects on social life of the ill individual and its family. Psychiatric syndromes and disorders in older population Rogina divides into two groups: - disorders of emotional reacting and behavior, without manifestations of other organic brain or physical disorders and - alternations caused by primary brain pathology, clinically presented as organic brain psycho-syndrome with different intensity and different pathogenesis etymology (cardiovascular, cerebro-vascular, neoplastic, metabolic, etc.) A combination of physical illness and mental disorder is the most common cause of the first hospitalization in older age.",

      "abstract": "El bruxismo es el habito parafuncional de apretar o rechinar los dientes sin ninguna finalidad masticatoria. Su etiopatogenia permanece aun desconocida, habiendo sido considerados como factores desencadenantes principales tanto las alteraciones oclusales (interferencias o prematuridades dentarias) como las psicoemocionales (ansiedad, estres, depresion). Ademas, es un habito que se desarrolla generalmente durante situaciones de bajo nivel de consciencia (sueno), por lo que se ha sugerido que los mecanismos reflejos protectores orofaciales, activos durante la funcion masticatoria en condiciones normales, estarian disminuidos o abolidos durante los episodios de bruxismo. De todos los reflejos orofaciales protectores, el mas relevante es el reflejo de apertura mandibular (RAM). Este es un reflejo nocioceptivo que se desencadena principalmente por la estimulacion de los receptores periodontales ante la presencia brusca e inesperada de objetos duros durante la masticacion de los alimentos. Asi mismo, dicho reflejo es facilmente evocado por estimulacion electrica de diversas regiones orofaciales en el animal de experimentacion. Ademas, se ha demostrado que esta modulado por a2-adrenoceptores centrales. En este contexto, ha sido aceptado que el estudio de la respuesta dosis-efecto inhibitorio para clonidina sobre el RAM evocado por estimulacion electrica en la rata constituye un modelo valido experimental para estudiar la sensibilidad y los mecanismos regulatorios de los a2-adrenoceptores centrales in vivo (Garcia-Vallejo et al., Br J Pharmacol 1994). Por otro lado, existen diversas evidencias de que el estres cronico altera la actividad del sistema noradrenergico a nivel central y modifica la sensibilidad de dichos a2-adrenoceptores en diversas regiones cerebrales. El objetivo de este Proyecto es evaluar si tanto las alteraciones oclusales como el estres potencian la inhibicion inducida por clonidina del",

Such patients complain of increased urination (pollakiuria), urinary incontinence (enuresis), urinary retention, or loss of urination. As a rule, for the first time, such patients turn to a pediatrician (therapist), then to a urologist who, after a comprehensive examination, excludes any organic violation of the genitourinary system. Psychogenic dysuria can be noted in the structure of general neurosis, be a somatoform disorder, or be a neurotic (usually conversion) monosymptom. Hysterical (conversion) disorders, by definition, are not simulative, but manipulative, representing either a way to draw attention to your person, which is typical for females, or being a kind of unconscious way out of a hopeless from the patients point of view situation, as it was in this case. For the same reasons, the treatment of patients with hysteria remains one of the most difficult problems, requiring the involvement of a specialized specialist a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Integrative psychotherapy (rational, behavioral and suggestive) is quite effective here, however, long-term treatment is usually required to achieve a good effect. Which consists of consultation with confrontational and paradoxical techniques, and the way out of such a confrontation is usually the same behavioral therapy and 510 sessions of hypnotherapy. The given clinical example is of scientific and practical interest, since the full effect was achieved after the first consultation and one session of hypnotic suggestive therapy.",

Postpartum psychosis is classified as a severe mental illness and affects 1–2:1,000 births in the UK and globally. In the UK, this equates to more than 1,400 women experiencing postpartum psychosis yearly. Postpartum psychosis can be characterised as an episode of mood disorder: mania with or without psychotic features or depression with psychosis which occurs soon after birth. It mostly has a sudden onset and a rapid deterioration and presents itself with a 'kaleidoscopic' clinical picture which includes severe mood swings, hallucinations and delusions, confusion, bewilderment and perplexity, interspersed with brief intervals of lucidity. Whilst it is considered a less common perinatal mental health condition, the implications for the woman, the infant and her family are significant, and postpartum psychosis is known to be an important contributing factor to maternal suicide, which is a significant cause of maternal death in the UK. However, better identification of potential risk factors antenatal and prompt detection and 248interventions postnatally can make a difference in the outcomes.",

Prevalence of this condition is unavailable in developing countries of the world. It is classified as \"L98.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) Disorder\" in ICD-10 and referred in some literature as \"dermatillomania\". ED is characterized by, but not invariably, the compulsive urge to pick, squeeze or scratch skin surfaces experienced by patients. Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis. Rarely, severe cases cause lifethreatening injuries. Risk of self-harm is increased by feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame and embarrassment.8 Studies further describe significant associations between ED and suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.",

The pain can be constant or episodic and functionally disabling. Any dysfunction of the central nervous system can lead to central sensitization, which enhances and maintains pain as well as other symptoms that are mediated by the central nervous system. It occurs in subgroups of nearly every chronic pain condition and is characterized by multifocal pain and co-occurring somatic symptoms. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is defined as a condition in which having one or more somatic symptoms, such as excessive worries, pressure, and catastrophic events. These symptoms can be very disruptive to a patient’s life and can cause significant distress. SSD cases with severe symptoms frequently undergo repeated medical investigations and the symptoms often lead patients to seek emergency medical treatment and consult with specialists repeatedly, which is a source of frustration for patients and clinicians. Here we report a case that Asian female with persistent CPPS with comorbid SSD, who got in trouble for up to 8 years. This case reminds clinicians to pay excessive attention to the diagnosis of CPPS with comorbid SSD after recovery from acute COVID-19, with hope of raising awareness in the identification of SSD and present new insight into appropriate treatment for each woman who suffers from it.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue can refer to a subjective symptom of malaise and aversion to activity or to objectively impaired performance. It has both physical and mental aspects. The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",

Acute onset of a fluctuating level of awareness, accompanied by sleep-wake cycle disruption, lethargy or agitation, and nocturnal worsening of symptoms, are diagnostic. Early recognition of delirium and treatment of its underlying cause are essential. (<i>JAMA</i>1987;258:1789-1792)",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a potential side effect of antipsychotic drugs: this article presents a critical review of the current literature. Although many studies have been published on the subject, only some used a validated sexual function rating scale and most lacked either a baseline or placebo control or both. In addition, many of the studies on sexual dysfunction associated with antipsychotic medication are limited by other methodological flaws. However, there is consistent evidence to suggest that a large number of antipsychotic drugs adversely affect one or more of the 3 phases of sexual response (desire, arousal and orgasm). Among the antipsychotics, the so called \"prolactin-raising\" are probably most associated with sexual dysfunction, even if further studies to confirm this are needed: the reviewed literature shows no consistent evidence that any one antipsychotic drug has a significantly superior side effect profile over another and current information on this topic is often based on methodologically weak research. Clinicians must be aware of drug-induced sexual dysfunction, since its presence can have important consequences for clinical management and compliance.",

      "title": "Abdominal Hernia Pain: Chronification Mechanisms after Hernia Surgery",
      "abstract": "Groin pain is the most common cause of surgical intervention. There are 3 parameters that increase the chances of chronic pain. On the one hand, starting the surgery with high intensity pain that has not been previously controlled. On the other, insufficient anesthetic and analgesic control during the surgical procedure. Finally, an inadequate management of acute postoperative pain. The presence of groin pain and its poor control before the intervention predisposes to difficulties during the perioperative process. Thus, the appearance of acute postoperative pain not adequately controlled will prevent its remission in a natural way in the usual period (approximately 1 month) and will cause it to progress in intensity and continuity (from 1 month to 3 months after surgery), transforming into a chronic pain (from 3 months after the intervention). In this process of chronification, in which pain goes from nociceptive to neuropathic, different physiological sensitization mechanisms are involved, both peripheral and central. The chronification of the painful process and, ultimately, the therapeutic approach that we will have to use to try to prevent this process depends to a large extent on these modifications that facilitate the change in the nature of pain.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition associated with at least 5 min of continuous seizures or repeated seizures without regaining consciousness between episodes. It is a medical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. The most common causes of SE are previous seizures, stroke, trauma, metabolic disorders, and central nervous system tumor. The aim of this review was to systematically review articles and ultimately develop evidence-based guidelines for the management of SE in resource-limited settings.This review was presented under the Protocol for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A literature search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and Medline databases from 2007 to 2021. The keywords for the literature search were (SE or controlled clinical trial) AND (SE or randomized controlled trial), (SE or multicenter trial) AND (SE or meta-analysis) AND (SE or crossover study).SE is an urgent medical emergency that requires early recognition and aggressive treatment. Medical treatment is initiated when seizures continue for more than 5 min after all stabilization measures have been taken. Based on the available evidence, diazepam can be used as a substitute for lorazepam in the treatment of SE. Ketamine is effective when given before other anesthetics as a third-line treatment in refractory and very refractory epilepsy. Propofol reduced the number of days of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of SE and has better seizure control than thiopental. Music has been recommended as an adjunctive therapy for epilepsy medication.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

      "abstract": "The intensity of pain perceived following physiological insult is unique to that individual. Pain, by IASP definition, is a subjective and psychological symptom. Circumstances, personality and psychiatric illness may amplify (and less commonly mute) volunteered pain scores. Most pain is organically initiated and then psychologically contaminated. The psychological and psychiatric factors influencing pain scores will be considered. Patients with a propensity to somatise may elaborate and/or maintain ‘organic’ pain. This occurs ‘unconsciously’ (without awareness). This process deceives the patient (and often also the doctor). Intentional amplification of pain and the construction of pain behaviours for care‐eliciting purpose (factitious disorder) or personal gain (malingering) deceives others. Though there are clinical clues to feigned pains able to be obtained from the history and signs such as those proposed by Waddell, it is notoriously difficult to differentiate partial malingering, conversion or somatoform pain and the pain signature of the particular patient. If the intent of symptom formation and its continuance is psychological, medicine has a diagnostic role. If the intent is for personal greed or is criminal, the diagnosis rests upon legal issues.",

Every physician has patients in his practice who experience pain which is unrelieved by the usual measures and in whom great physical and mental suffering result. Not infrequently such patients are totally incapacitated, a burden to their families, addicted to drugs, at times mentally unbalanced, unpredictable and always self concerned.

To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

Warning signsWhen symptoms are present for more than a month, cause diffi culties in functioning normally at a social, professional or other important level, or cause signifi cant suffering, it may be a PTSD.However, traumatic events do not cause PTSD in everyone who experiences them.Certain factors could lead to vulnerability to developing the disorder: having a biological fragility, having been the victim of physical or sexual abuse in the past, suffering from other mental health disorders [3], having had behavioral problems during childhood or adolescence or being subjected to chronic stressors.",

The symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity tend to be less evident. Objectives - Frequently, the adult patient with ADHD comes to the consultation with a secondary symptom and the primary pathology is hidden and often not evident at first glance. Methods - A 20-year-old woman, university student, with no relevant medical or psychiatric history, without toxic habits, who attended her first consultation referred by her primary care physician for long-standing insomnia, restless legs and anxiety. - The patient’s underlying complaint and her bigger concern is her poor academic performance. It is striking that she has just started her third year at the university, the first year she did not pass any subjects, the second year she changed majors and only passed two, now she is repeating the course. - The examination did not reveal overt affective symptoms, nor psychotic symptoms or other notable psychopathology. The patient’s speech tended towards superficiality, inconcretion, it was salty, it was difficult for her to express herself, even suggesting a certain intellectual disability. - In the first consultation sleep study is requested. And referral to clinical psychology consultation for psychometric study. Results - She is administered Clinical interview and WAIS IV (Adult Intelligence Scale), Trail Making Test, d2 and Stroop, Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (inattention items). - The WAIS-IV demonstrated global cognitive abilities within normality, although with significantly lower scores in the IMT and IVP indices which involve the functions of attention, concentration, mental control and short-term visual memory). Trail Making Test, d2, Stroop and Diagnostic Interview of ADHD in adults (inattention items) yielded profile results highly suggestive of Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity. - The insomnia subsided with a regimen of 7.5 mg of mirtazapine per day. Subsequently, after starting treatment with low-dose methylphenidate (20 mg/day), the patient improved very significantly, both academic performance and social functioning and mood, self-esteem and subjective well-being. Conclusions - We must always include ADHD in the differential diagnosis of a young adult patient when faced with a wide variety of consultation symptoms, especially if they report some type of deterioration or dysfunction in their social, family or academic life. - An adequate clinical evaluation supported, if possible, by psychometric tests is essential to reach the diagnosis, which allows establishing an effective treatment that modifies the patient’s overall prognosis.

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AUTO-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLSCENTS",
      "abstract": "There are various external factors that cause feelings, favorable for the formation of suicidal behavior: misunderstanding, meaningful rejection by others, experienced abuse, loneliness, alienation; loss of parental love, love – the key negative emotions are jea-lousy, death, divorce, escape from the family of some of the parents – despair, insult, jealousy; contempt, amazed selfishness – insult, anger, hatred, aggression as a desire to revenge, etc. It has been established that approximately half of examples of suicidal youth behavior are associated with destructive family problems, with a negative attitude towards them.Interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict in the conditions of social, psychological, existential crisis on the background of mental disadaptation can acquire a suicidogenic character. In all cases, the crucial moment in the formation of manifestation of suicidal behavior is precisely a suicidogenic conflict. Adoption of a suicidal decision (regardless of the causes, conditions, forms of maladaptation) occurs only after the phase of personal re-development of suicidogenic conflict.In our study, the group of suicide risk is totally 27.2 %. Researchers from this risk group are less readers of books, play computer games, attend interest groups, but are more on the streets and do their home affairs. They have significantly more problems with their father, mother, brothers and sisters, and their peers. They are mostly dissatisfied with the degree of realization of material and spiritual needs in their family. In the vast majority of high school students of the risk group, there are high levels of anxiety and mental and physical exhaustion, the experience of loneliness, hopelessness, irrationality of existence.In a greater number of senior pupils-licetists a factor of high anxiety was the fear of not meeting the expectations of others. Analysis of the data of the questionnaires of high school students of the risk group allowed to highlight and describe the main variants of individual images of states that can lead to auto-aggressive behavior of young people. The most striking feature is the sense of guilt, which arises as a result of inadequate assessment of one’s own actions or intentions, numerous, often groundless, self-excuse, hyperbolization of their mistakes, impairment of achievements, reproach of conscientiousness, and the desire to get out of life.",

      "abstract": "Emotionally disturbed patients commonly progress along a path that begins with nebulous complaints in doctors' offices and continues with accidents, delinquencies, troubles with family and police, unemployment, alcoholism, and either suicide or institutional adjustment. The path can be reversed, but such reversal involves immensely difficult personal and social problems. The logical approach would be to attack emotional disturbance at its point and time of origin. If it cannot be stopped there, systematic efforts must be made to reverse the trend at whatever stage may have been reached. In any case, the progress of the patient toward prolonged or permanent institutional life should be halted if possible, and he should work toward the reestablishment of a healthy, dynamic relation to the community.",

      "abstract": "This report describes a 25‐year‐old vigorous young man who had a history of eight years of near syncope and syncope of unknown etiology. Repeat in‐hospital observation and laboratory electrophysiologic functional testing did not elucidate the origin of the symptoms. Prolonged Holler monitoring finally showed that the syncopal attacks were caused by a sick sinus syndrome (SSS). On electrophysiologic study, a concealed rate‐dependent unidirectional antegrade accessory A‐V pathway (AP) was found to be present. The AP was an incidental finding and was unrelated to the patient's symptoms. The symptomatic SSS may occur in the young as well as in the elderly. Sinoatrial dysfunction may be intermittent and difficult to detect, may cause severe symptoms, and may even be life‐threatening. Prior to definitive therapy (such as the permanent implantation of a pacemaker), the importance of relating symptoms to a rhythm disturbance has been stressed. In cases where the cause of the symptoms is not obvious, this is best accomplished by continuous Holter monitoring.",

      "abstract": "According to the International Society for Continence, incontinence is defined as a complaint to any unintentionally urine leakage. Approximately one hundred million older people suffer from urinary incontinence. The reason being that it is more frequent with the increase of age. At an older age there are some changes in cell function, central nervous system control, hormonal balance and immune response of the organism. Elderly people want more information on bladder control, and nurses have to take on the leading role in applying the approach of promoting continence and educating the public about urinary incontinence. Nurses in all activities with older adults need to evaluate urine control data, and it is also necessary to carry out nursing interventions that stimulate continence. Incontinence is classified as acute or chronic. Acute incontinence has a sudden start, is present for 6 months or less, and is usually caused by factors that can be treated. Chronic urinary incontinence may have a sudden or gradual start of the disease and is divided into the following types: urgent, stress, overwhelming, functional, mixed and reflex incontinence. Stressed, functional and urgent are the most common urinary incontinence occurring that in older age. People suffering from urinary incontinence problems need to be thoroughly examined and each patient is treated individually and thoroughly. Multidisciplinary approach is required in the treatment of urinary incontinence. This public health problem has an impact on the quality of life of an individual every day, so timely and planned treatment is very important. Treatment can be performed by conservative, surgical and medication methods, all in order to reduce the symptoms and complications, and completely cure urinary incontinence. The nurse is a member of a health team who is in constant contact with the patient. In the entire healing process, the nurse is there to give him psychic support. In addition, she educates the person and his family about all the symptoms of incontinence, possible complications and healing of the same. In addition, it educates the person and his family about all the symptoms of incontinence, possible complications and healing. During the health care process, she determines the need for health care, and on that basis carries out individual interventions which will help the individual to establish continence, control incontinence, and raise the quality of his life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Emotional abuse is common, and can occur alone or in conjunction with other forms of abuse. It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

Anxiety is the complex blend of unpleasant emotions and cognitions that is both more oriented to the future and much more diffuse than fear (2).Anxiety has not only cognitive components but also physiological and behavioural components. At the cognitive level anxiety involves negative mood worry about the possible future, threat or danger, self-preoccupation and future threat and to control it if it occurs. At the physiological level anxiety often creates a state of tension and chronic over arousal which may affect readiness for delaying with danger. At behavioural level anxiety may create a strong tendency to avoid situations where danger might encounter but there is not the immediate urge to flee with anxiety as there is with fear (3). An increased risk of muscular skeletal disorder was found in workers with pre-existing anxiety and depression compared to the without them (4).",

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

      "abstract": "Menstrual irregularities are the main reason for seeking advice from gynecologists all over the world. Menstruation-related problems affect 75% of teenage girls. The presence of a somatic disease has a significant impact on the personality and emotional sphere, and in cases where the disease occurs in an already difficult adolescence, there are serious threats of psychopathological disorders and disorders of personal development. The etiology of menstrual disorders can be psychogenic or hormonal. The identification of the correct etiology makes it possible to select adequate therapies. The main pathogenetic axis of pathology is formed by the circular relationship of mental and somatic factors. An analysis of the literature data allows us to conclude that such patients have increased anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, mood instability, as well as symptoms of depression and distortion in the structure of identity. A multidisciplinary approach should include a collaborative process between gynecologists, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, from the moment of diagnosis and throughout treatment.",

      "title": "Pelvic Floor Dysfunction: The Need for a Multidisciplinary Team Approach",
      "abstract": "In Brief Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) is a disorder predominantly affecting females. It is common and undermines the quality of lives of at least one third of women. There is little agreement on the reasons for such a high prevalence of pelvic floor disorders, the relative importance of specific risk factors that predispose to their development, or the poor outcome sequelae of treatment or subsequent prevention. Mechanical, neural, and endocrine disturbances all play a role in the development of PFD with the principal causative factors associated with childbirth and obstetric injury, previous gynecological or anorectal surgery, aging, menopause, obesity, and conditions that produce chronic pelvic floor straining. Subsequent deterioration in long-term pelvic floor support and function of the pelvic viscera is the result of either direct muscular damage (for example to the anal sphincter complex) and/or cumulative pressure that leads to weakness and injury to the pelvic muscles, ligaments, and the pudendal nerve supplying them. There is a wide range of functional problems seen with pelvic floor disorders. They are anatomically grouped together and are often assessed and managed within individual specialties rather than within a comprehensive multidisciplinary setting. It is has been found that an established team approach with fully integrated services can be more effective and offers many advantages including dynamic links between disciplines, appropriate and timely investigations and referrals, and better coordination of patient-centered care. Many disciplines may be involved in the care of women with pelvic floor dysfunction, yet evidence-based treatment strategies are still lacking and there is little consensus on a standardized treatment approach in this area. Integrating services can be problematic, especially when a degree of flexibility and understanding is required to initiate change and adopt new practices. Inherent in achieving and promoting better services for women with PFD are new approaches to care that focus on the development of combined outpatient and joint surgical procedures and introduction of evidence-based combination therapies. The aim of this paper is to discuss current practice for each of the main pelvic floor disorders and consider how assessment, management, and treatment outcomes of combined symptomatology may be improved. Pelvic floor dysfunction is a common disorder predominantly affecting females. It undermines the quality of lives of at least one third of adult women.",

In turn, the sick role entitles the factitious disorder patient to care, nurturance, and protection; it also exempts one from usual responsibilities. In this paper, we present the first reported case of factitious pedophilia. Although it seems counterintuitive, this middle-aged man has falsely claimed or exaggerated sexual desire for minors ostensibly to remain in a state hospital; indeed, he has remained in the same inpatient facility for more than 20 years as a result of his deceptions. At times, his reports have included disconfirmed claims of bizarre accidents and other physical travails. This case enlarges the literature on factitious psychological disorders and shows that some individuals may falsify paraphilic behaviors, although clearly minimization of these behaviors remains more common.",

      "title": "Is Multiple Sclerosis Patient Depressed, Stressed, or Both? How to Sort through Overlapping Symptoms and Provide Appropriate Treatment",
      "abstract": "Mrs. S, age 50, has had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for approximately 10 years. She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships.

While the cause of the immediate response was to be the compression of the periodontal ligament (PDL), the delayed response was attributed to the hyperalgesia of the PDL.

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to evaluation and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) involves taking an accurate history, prospective daily symptom monitoring to establish the diagnosis, patient-specific initial medical or psychological therapy, and adequate follow-up with appropriate alterations in the treatment plan. A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL) is characterized by fractures (resulting from radiologically demonstrable polycystic osseous lesions), frontal lobe syndrome, and progressive presenile dementia beginning in the fourth decade. The clinical course of PLOSL can be divided into four stages: 1 The latent stage is characterized by normal early development. 2 The osseous stage (3rd decade of life) is characterized by pain and tenderness, mostly in ankles and feet, usually following strain or injury. Fractures are typically diagnosed several years later, most commonly in the bones of the extremities. 3 In the early neurologic stage (4th decade of life), a change of personality begins to develop insidiously. Affected individuals show a frontal lobe syndrome (loss of judgment, euphoria, loss of social inhibitions, disturbance of concentration, and lack of insight, libido, and motor persistence) leading to serious social problems. 4 The late neurologic stage is characterized by progressive dementia and loss of mobility. Death usually occurs before age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PLOSL can be established in a proband with radiologically demonstrable polycystic osseous lesions, frontal lobe syndrome, and progressive presenile dementia beginning in the fourth decade. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TYROBP or TREM2 can confirm the diagnosis if radiographic and clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Orthopedic surgery and/or devices may be of value in individual cases. Antiepileptic drugs can be used to prevent epileptic seizures and secondary worsening of the condition. Prevention of secondary complications: Some of the social consequences of PLOSL may be avoided if family members are informed early about the nature of the disorder. Surveillance: Intervals for follow up of bone lesions and neurologic and psychiatric manifestations must be determined on an individual basis. Genetic counseling PLOSL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a TREM2 or TYROBP pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.",

These symptoms disappear at the beginning of menstruation, and a symptom-free period of at least a week ensues. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a variation of PMS, with predominantly psychological symptoms. The aetiology of PMD and PMDD is not known. A possible explanation however is an abnormal, stronger reaction to physiologically normal hormonal fluctuations. Diagnosing PMS and PMDD requires prospective daily monitoring of symptoms over at least two menstrual cycles. No effective medication for the treatment of PMS has been registered in the Netherlands. In randomized placebo-controlled trials selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and oral contraceptives containing drosperinone have been found to have a positive effect on the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS and PMDD.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Genital self‑mutilation: A challenging pathology (Review)",
      "abstract": "Genital self‑mutilation is a pathology that leads to numerous and important discussions, rarely presented in the medical literature. There have been many attempts to explain the reasons behind these medical phenomena, but single cases have been generally reported, making it extremely difficult to draw valid conclusions. It is acknowledged that there are psychotic and non‑psychotic causes, from psychiatric problems and sexual identity disorders to cultural or religious reasons, alcohol or recreational drug consumption, unconventional types of sexual satisfaction or self‑satisfaction. Recent theories consider self‑mutilation as a phenomenon of reducing distress or tension, as an expression of feelings of anger or sorrow. It is believed that 55‑85% of those who have resorted to self‑mutilation have at least once in their life tried to commit suicide. There is evidence that early discovery and intervention as well as proper treatment in regards to psychosis can significantly reduce the number of self‑mutilation episodes, with a protective role of these individuals. Cases of genital self‑mutilation may be considered real medical emergencies, sometimes extremely challenging and accompanied by severe complications. Injury of the genital area is usually accompanied by numerous early or long‑term complications due to the marked vascular area and to the microbial flora present in this part of the body. The degree of mutilation is an unforeseen aspect that the medical staff may have to encounter during the intervention, sometimes testing their imagination and surgical skills when dealing with such a case. Understanding the causes of these self‑aggressive behaviors, which may be life‑threatening, is critical and multidisciplinary mobilization is needed after treatment of the acute phases. The outcome of these patients depends on integrated collaborative work. These cases represent a serious reason for frustration for the physicians involved in solving them, and knowledge of these issues is valuable to urologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive compulsive disorder is a severe and disabling clinical condition that usually arises in late adolescence or early adulthood and, if left untreated, has a chronic course. Objectives To report and discuss a clinical case, followed by the authors. Aims/Methods Consultation of the patient's medical file, serial clinical evaluations and scientific literature review. Results 33 years-old male, married, degree in economics. Observed in the emergency room for having thoughts dominated by ideas of obsessive content, with a sense of self-reference, associated with recurrent compulsions as cleaning and checking rituals, consequential high levels of hopelessness and a depressive mood, with jeopardized chronobiological rhythms. This clinical condition started seven years before and seriously undermined the patient’s autonomy. Some of the difficulties outlined by the patient are: on his way to and from work, whenever he passed by a crosswalk he would circle the following roundabout several times, to confirm that he hadn't run over any pedestrian; at the end of the day, he would go through the same path in reverse, by bicycle, to confirm that no pedestrians had been run over by him. After two years of psychopharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy the patient showed significant clinical improvement. Conclusions On this case, the most likely diagnosis is an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The particularity of this case lays on its severity, given its evolution period, the psychopathological richness demonstrated and the functional commitment of the patient; and in the significant clinical improvements observed, largely due to optimal patient adherence to treatment.",

According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

There still exists no compelling evidence to indicate widespread severe emotional sequelae. The paradox of the vasectomy situation is that, though a high patient enthusiasm may be stated postoperatively, some evidence often nevertheless exists of a negative psychological impact. The overt enthusiasm appears to be an example of cognitive dissonance, a common defense in which one publicly overemphasizes a view expedient to oneself but at variance with one's private experience. In efforts to compensate for imagined loses in masculinity, men sometimes increase sexual activity but to their despair develop temporary (psychological) impotence.

      "title": "Nocturnal Enuresis: Current Concepts",
      "abstract": "Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: Nocturnal enuresis affects approximately 5 to 7 million children in the United States, making it the most common pediatric urologic complaint encountered by primary care physicians. Despite its prevalence, nocturnal enuresis remains incompletely understood, which can frustrate patients, family members, and physicians. Appropriate intervention is justified for the affected child because of the potential consequences of family stress, social withdrawal, and poor self-esteem.Enuresis refers to the persistence of inappropriate voiding of urine beyond the age of anticipated bladder control (age 4 to 5 y at the latest). The development of bladder control is a multidimensional process that requires sensory awareness of bladder fullness by the child, capacity for storage of urine, voluntary control of the bladder sphincter, psychological desire for control, and a positive training experience. Diurnal enuresis is involuntary leaking of urine during waking hours. Nocturnal enuresis refers to involuntary passage of urine during sleep and is classified as primary (no prior period of sustained dryness) or secondary (recurrence of nighttime wetting after 6 mo or longer of dryness). Recent urology literature describes another classification of nocturnal enuresis based on the presence or absence of other bladder symptoms. Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) is defined as a normal void occurring at night in bed in the absence of any other symptoms referable to the urogenital tract, and it precludes any daytime symptomatology. It is the focus of this article. Polysymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is bed-wetting associated with other bladder symptoms such as urgency, frequency,instability, or voiding dysfunction. Investigations of patients who have MNE reveal that they are clearly different from patients who have PNE.The spontaneous resolution rate of nocturnal enuresis is approximately 15% per year, with 1% of teenagers at 15 years of age still wetting the bed (Fig. 1). Parents may become concerned about nocturnal enuresis when their child reaches 5 to 6 years of age and is preparing to enter school. Most children are not concerned until 7 to 8 years of age. Approximately 80% to 85% of children who have nocturnal enuresis have MNE. Another 5% to 10% of cases meet the definition of PNE, with daytime wetting or other bladder symptoms. Organic causes are responsible for nocturnal enuresis in fewer than 5% of cases. Such organic causes must be searched for and ruled out if the history suggests their presence. There is a slight male predominance (about 60% overall) for nocturnal enuresis. Etiologic factors contributing to MNE include genetics, sleep arousal dysfunction,urodynamics, nocturnal polyuria, psychological components, and maturational delay. That the condition probably is multifactorial, with various contributing factors in any one patient, confounds attempts to base therapeutic approaches on etiology.A hereditary basis for nocturnal enuresis has been suspected for years. Studies of twins show a concordance rate of 43% to 68% for monozygotic and 19% to 36% for dizygotic twins. Seventy percent of children who have enuresis have a parent who has a history of the disorder. Studies indicate that if one parent had enuresis, the probability of a child having it is approximately 40% to 45%. If both parents were affected, the probability of a child having the condition increases to 70% to 77%. If neither parent had enuresis, only 15% of offspring will have enuresis. Chromosomes 12q, 13q, and 22 all have been named as possible locations of a gene(s) resulting in enuresis, but a specific mechanism for enuresis related to a gene locus is not known.The association between the presence of a full bladder and the sensation in the brain of a full bladder occurs in most children by the age of 5 years,which correlates with the normative standard in the United States for nocturnal dryness in 85% of 5-year-olds. Concurrently, by this age the child's pattern of several sleep/wake cycles daily, known as multiphasic sleep, has changed to a single period of sleep daily, known as monophasic sleep. Daytime urination control usually occurs first,followed by learning to arouse during sleep to the sensation of a full bladder. Many parents report that a child who has enuresis is more difficult to arouse from sleep than are other children in the home, but sleep studies have not documented a convincing association between a child's sound sleep and a nocturnal wetting episode.The relationship of sleep patterns with enuresis is an area of active research. In some studies, the enuretic event seemed to occur during nonREM sleep and could occur during any part of the night. In others,enuresis reportedly was caused by a mild disturbance in arousal, based on the finding that activation of the arousal center proceeded correctly, but the transition from light sleep to complete awakening was not achieved properly. In a subset of patients, the arousal center in the brain failed to activate, despite proper full bladder sensation. There is conflicting evidence that children who have enuresis may exhibit other parasomnias, such as sleepwalking and night terrors. A recurrent theme in sleep research is the child's inability to recognize the sensation of a full bladder during sleep and failure to awaken from sleep to urinate in an appropriate place. There appears to be a maturational pattern of progressive central nervous system \"recognition\" of bladder fullness and control over the micturition reflex.Some children who have enuresis may have a small bladder capacity. Functional bladder capacity in children may be estimated by the formula: age in years plus 2, which gives bladder capacity in ounces. By adolescence, this no longer applies; adult bladder capacity is approximately 10 to 15 oz. Children who have small bladder capacities probably represent a subgroup of patients who have MNE and presumably cannot hold the normal amount of urine produced at night. They are more likely to report frequent daytime voiding,some nights with multiple episodes of enuresis per night, and no history of attaining dryness.In some children who have normal bladder capacities,urgency may play a role in nocturnal enuresis. These children exhibit daytime urgency, but they can maintain bladder control during the day. They have a pattern of partial emptying of the bladder that results in frequent daytime urination to maintain continence and enuresis occurring at night when they cannot void as often. No evidence supports abnormal urodynamics in children who have MNE. Involuntary nighttime voiding in those who have MNE occurs with a urodynamically normal bladder at functional capacity. Because most patients who have abnormal urodynamics as an underlying cause for their nighttime enuresis also have daytime symptoms, asking patients about daytime voiding patterns in the initial history is important.Polyuria is defined as excessive urine production. It may be associated with chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Caffeine,alcohol, and medications also may cause it. Factors such as irregular food and drink intake and staying up late also may contribute. It seems reasonable to limit fluid intake several hours prior to bedtime because the most common cause of polyuria is habit polydipsia.Since first described in 1985, the theory that MNE is due to nocturnal polyuria with relative nocturnal deficiency of pituitary-produced antidiuretic hormone(ADH) has been controversial. Early studies reported that the plasma level of ADH did not increase during sleep in those who had enuresis compared with a rise in ADH among unaffected children, resulting in relative nocturnal polyuria as a factor in enuresis. Studies documenting the percentage of children who have enuresis and lack a nocturnal surge in ADH ranges from 25% to 100%, suggesting the presence of other factors. New research about polyuria and enuresis theorizes that a full bladder might communicate with the kidneys to reduce urine production. Some recent investigations also suggest abnormal osmoregulatory function in the kidney, with higher solute excretion among those who have enuresis.Most children who have enuresis have no psychological disorder. The dated concept that enuresis frequently is due to anxiety or stress is unproven. On the contrary, enuresis creates psychosocial problems for the bed-wetting child, including poor self-esteem,family stress, and social isolation. Secondary enuresis commonly has been attributed to psychological factors. Recent studies show no major psychological differences between children who have secondary enuresis and children who have no enuresis. If a child reverts to bed-wetting during treatment for enuresis or has increased episodes of bed-wetting during times of stress, it is more likely due to poor compliance with treatment. Children who have enuresis not only have lower self-esteem than unaffected children, but they have lower self-esteem than children who have chronic,debilitating illnesses. These study results both emphasize the profound impact that enuresis may have and justify a careful evaluation of psychosocial symptoms in the family and the patient.The fact that most children who have enuresis become dry in time with or without intervention supports maturational delay as a factor in MNE. At age 5 years,15% of children occasionally wet the bed compared with only 10% at 6 years of age. Perhaps development of central nervous system recognition of and response to the sensation of a full bladder is delayed, a concept that correlates strongly with the arousal dysfunction theory. Proposed abnormal urodynamic factors also may normalize as the child becomes older. A similar process of maturation over time is seen in other milestones of normal development,such as the age range of 9 to 15 months at which a child begins to walk. Maturational delay may be the most plausible and unifying concept among proposed etiologic factors in MNE.In addition to a detailed toilet training history, a family history of enuresis should be sought because it rarely is volunteered, even when known by a parent. Other pertinent details of a history include the onset and pattern of wetting, voiding behavior, sleep pattern, parasomnias, medical conditions, daytime urinary symptoms, bowel habits, and psychosocial factors. It also is important to assess both the family's and the patient's attitude toward the bed-wetting and their readiness to initiate and continue treatment. Questions about voiding patterns may reveal urgency or a history of small, frequent voids that suggests bladder instability or small bladder capacity. Organic causes of enuresis may be apparent by a history of dysuria (urinary tract infection),polyuria and polydipsia (diabetes insipidus or mellitus), encopresis (constipation), abnormal urine stream (lower obstructive lesions), gait disturbances(spinal cord pathology), or nighttime snoring(adenoidal hypertrophy). A thorough and thoughtful history is the means by which the infrequent organic causes of enuresis are separated from the majority of cases that have no organic etiology (TableT1). Most children who have nocturnal enuresis will have normal findings on physical examination. In addition to assessing the child's height, weight, and blood pressure, perform a complete examination, paying careful attention to the urogenital, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems. A palpable bladder or palpable stool may be present on abdominal examination, ectopic ureter or signs of sexual abuse on urogenital examination, or abnormal gait apparent during neurologic examination. Cremasteric, anal, abdominal,and deep tendon reflexes that reflect spinal cord function all should be tested. The skin of the lower back should be inspected for the presence of a sacral dimple, hair patches, or vascular birthmarks, which can be clues to spinal dysraphism. Mouth breathing may suggest sleep apnea with associated enuresis due to adenoidal hypertrophy. Direct observation of the urinary stream in the office is important, especially if findings on the history suggest an abnormality. The family can measure bladder capacity at home prior to the initial evaluation or it can be measured in the office by having the child drink 12 oz of fluid on arrival, then voiding into a calibrated cup.All children who have enuresis should have urinalysis of a clean-catch midstream urine specimen (Fig 2). The ability to concentrate urine to 1.015 or greater rules out diabetes insipidus and the absence of glucose rules out diabetes mellitus as causes of nocturnal enuresis. Further laboratory testing is unnecessary for MNE. A urine culture should be obtained for symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection on history or findings on urinalysis. Routine radiologic or ultrasonographic imaging studies of the urinary tract or cystoscopy are not recommended for children who have MNE. PNE may require further evaluation with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), renal and bladder ultrasonography, or urodynamic testing. When enuresis is resistant to treatment and the history suggests a sleep disorder, a sleep study may be useful to look for sleep apnea or parasomnias.An important factor in any pediatric treatment is the child's motivation and acceptance. Parents also must support the child and the treatment program for maximal effectiveness. The child's age is a critical factor when formulating a treatment plan. Consideration of treatment is guided by the clinician's understanding of the changing prevalence of enuresis in school-age children and the effect of enuresis on the child's self-esteem and family function. Timing of the intervention should be tailored to the individual child and family.Although a child's self-esteem can be harmed by MNE, even at early school age, the effects are variable. Some school-age children and their parents are not bothered by the child's enuresis; others experience anxiety and stress. It is reasonable to discuss MNE during a health supervision visit and provide facts for families of patients at 6 or 7 years of age. The maturational aspects of nighttime awakening to void should be explained to parents and likened to other familiar developmental milestones that occur over a range of time rather than at a specific age. Providing plausible medical explanations, identifying a family history of enuresis, and defining its age-specific prevalence may lessen the burden on the child. Parents should understand that punishment or negative reinforcement is counterproductive, both in resolving the enuresis and in protecting the child's self-esteem. For children and families who are bothered by the child's enuresis,targeted intervention is recommended by age 8 years at the latest. In general, MNE should be thoroughly explained, selectively treated, and never ignored.This approach begins with educating parents and the child about enuresis, a process that usually allays guilt. Handouts with printed instructions can teach the parents and the child to manage the condition. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each night that he or she is dry. The child should be taken out of diapers or training pants and encouraged to empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. The risk of secondary psychological injury to the child's self-esteem is minimized by discouraging ridicule from siblings and by avoiding a critical, demoralizing approach.Because excessive fluid intake before bedtime can cause increased nocturnal urine production, as can caffeinated beverages and certain foods (eg, dairy products, citrus juices, chocolate), restricting fluids for 2 hours prior to bedtime is reasonable. The child should agree to fluid restriction, however, rather than having it imposed. The rate of complete resolution of enuresis with motivational therapy alone is estimated to be only 25%, but up to 70% of children who have MNE have some reduction in the number of wet nights. Once consistently dry nights are achieved, the reported relapse rate is low. Motivational therapy is a reasonable first-line approach, especially with the younger child. If unsuccessful after a trial of 3 to 6 months, a different treatment program should be considered.This approach includes dry-bed training and classic conditioning therapy using an enuresis alarm system. Hypnotherapy also may be part of a comprehensive program to treat enuresis. This therapy involves an age-appropriate explanation of how the brain and bladder communicate, taking the mystery out of enuresis by educating the patient and family, teaching relaxation techniques, and having the child practice imagery of awakening to urinate in the toilet or staying dry all night. It can be combined with an alarm system. Frequent office visits are required initially until the physician is certain that the child can practice imagery at home; then, visits may be monthly. Referral to a behavioral pediatrician or clinic may be necessary if the primary care physician does not have the necessary training or time for this approach.Dry-bed training (as described by Azrin and Thienes in 1978) involves waking the child on a progressive schedule at decreasing intervals over several nights,having the child change pajamas and bedding if wet or walk to the toilet when voiding is needed. As in the use of alarm therapy, the eventual goal is to have the child self-awaken to void. Although a high cure rate is reported with this technique by the authors, it is a more time- and labor-intensive process than most families are willing to undertake.Enuresis alarms have the highest overall cure rate of any available treatment. They also represent the best-researched behavioral intervention. Alarm systems can be used in combination with motivational and other behavioral therapy techniques or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Several different alarm devices range in cost from $50 to $75. Insurance companies may cover an enuresis alarm with a prescription from the physician describing it as a medical device. In contrast to the older bell-and-pad type of alarms, the new devices are portable, small,and worn directly on the child's clothing. They emit a transistorized audio or vibratory alarm when urine is sensed in the underpants.Alarms are most effective when combined with other behavioral or pharmacologic therapy. The alarm wakes the child or parent from sleep, who then implements the appropriate component of the behavioral program. The alarm allows the parent and child to intervene and monitors bed-wetting as the program proceeds. Parents and child should be told that this treatment requires a long-term commitment and may take several months to achieve a cure. The device can be discontinued when the child has had three consecutive weeks of dry nights. The cure rate may be as high as 70% long-term. Among the 10% to 15% of children who relapse,most can be treated successfully with a repeat of the original alarm program.Methods to reduce alarm failure include pretesting the child for his or her ability to awaken to the alarm and encouraging parents and child to continue using the alarm. Failure also can be reduced by enabling the child who is afraid of the dark to walk to the toilet using a flashlight or night light in the room or by offering other options to the child who is reluctant to try an enuresis alarm. If a child does not awaken to the alarm during pretesting, dry-bed training or parent awakening should precede the use of the alarm. One study showed that an ordinary alarm clock used with dry-bed training was as effective as an enuresis alarm. This may be an attractive alternative to families who cannot afford an alarm or whose insurance will not cover it.(See the 1997 Pediatrics in Review article by Schmitt for practical tips on successful use of the enuresis alarm.)Medication is an attractive treatment modality for parents who hope for relatively effortless success. However, medication alone for initial treatment of nocturnal enuresis is never preferred and seldom should be considered before 8 years of age, even in combination therapy. Three drugs are used most commonly for the treatment of enuresis: imipramine, desmopressin(DDAVP), and oxybutynin. Imipramine and DDAVP have been evaluated in the treatment of MNE; oxybutynin is used primarily in polysymptomatic enuresis.Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used for more than 3 decades to treat nocturnal enuresis. It appears to increase bladder capacity through a weak anticholinergic effect and also may decrease detrusor muscle contractions via noradrenergic effects. The starting dose is 25 mg taken 1 hour before bedtime for children ages 6 to 8 years and 50 to 75 mg for older children and adolescents. The duration of action is 8 to 12 hours. The dose may be increased in 25-mg increments weekly up to 75 mg. Therapy may continue from 3 to 9 months, with a slow tapering of medication recommended over 3 to 4 weeks in 25-mg decrements. Imipramine is relatively inexpensive,and the clinical response is usually apparent during the first week of treatment. The initial success rate(dry at 6 months posttreatment) is reported to be 15% to 50%, but the relapse rate is high following drug discontinuation.When used at the recommended dosage, mild side effects include irritability, dry mouth, decreased appetite, headaches, and sleep disturbances. An accidental or intentional overdose, however, can have serious and potentially lethal effects, including ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures, and coma. Because of its narrow toxic/therapeutic ratio, some clinicians are understandably reluctant to use imipramine to treat a relatively benign, self-limiting condition such as nocturnal enuresis. If imipramine therapy is selected,the physician must counsel the family carefully about the dangerous potential of its accidental ingestion,safe storage of the drug, and supervision of the child taking the medication.DDAVP is a synthetic analog of arginine vasopressin (ADH). Acting on the distal tubules of the kidney, it increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts, producing a more concentrated, lower volume of urine. The use of DDAVP to treat nocturnal enuresis is based on the observation that some children who have enuresis do not have the normal nocturnal rise in ADH production, potentially leading to polyuria. DDAVP theoretically reduces urine volume at night in such children, who thereby can avoid a full bladder at night.DDAVP is available in an oral form and a nasal spray. The bioavailability is only 1% for the tablet and 10% for the nasal spray. Its duration of action is extended (approximately 10 to 12 h), and it is rapidly absorbed from the nasal mucosa. The initial dose of DDAVP is 20 mcg or one 10-mcg puff in each nostril within 2 hours of bedtime, regardless of the patient's age. The dose may be increased in increments of 10 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks up to a maximum dose of 40 mcg. The response to DDAVP usually can be evaluated within a few days of starting therapy. Patients may remain on medication for 3 to 6 months,then should begin a slow decrease of the dose by 10 mcg/mo. If a child remains enuretic after 6 months of therapy, combination therapy may be considered. If oral medication is preferred, the starting dose is 0.2 mg(one tablet) administered 1 hour before bedtime. If there is no response within 1 week, the dose can be titrated by 0.2 mg up to a maximum of 0.6 mg nightly.Side effects of DDAVP are rare and include abdominal discomfort, nausea, headache, and epistaxis. Symptomatic hyponatremia with seizures has been reported very rarely, usually in the context of exceeding the recommended dosage. Nonetheless,nighttime fluid restriction is a reasonable recommendation for those receiving DDAVP. Contraindications include habit polydipsia,hypertension, and heart disease. There are few data on long-term use of DDAVP. In a Swedish study that monitored children who had MNE, 22% became dry with DDAVP, a response not significantly different from the spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year. All patients, however, had a marked reduction in the number of enuretic events per month. More patients remained dry after slow tapering of the DDAVP dose than following abrupt discontinuation of the medicine. Various studies show immediate response rates as high as 70% and relapse rates as high as 95%. Moffat et al reviewed 18 controlled studies of DDAVP and found overall that only 25% of children were completely dry on the medicine, with a relapse rate similar to that noted previously.DDAVP's high initial response rate is attractive for episodic use to treat enuresis, alone or in combination with other treatments. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis. DDAVP also may be useful to bridge the gap between enuresis and dryness during other treatments. Using DDAVP episodically also reduces its rather significant cost, which may be $150 to$250 for 1 month of nightly use.Oxybutynin chloride is an anticholinergic and antispasmodic drug that has a role in reducing uninhibited bladder contractions. It is used primarily to treat children who have symptoms of daytime urgency or frequency in addition to nighttime enuresis. It appears to be no better than placebo in treating children who have MNE. Side effects are related to the anticholinergic action of the drug and include flushing, blurred vision, constipation, tremor, and decreased ability to sweat. The recommended starting dose is 5 to 10 mg/d (or 0.1 mg/kg) for most children. This drug is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat enuresis in children younger than 5 years of age. Hyoscyamine is another anticholinergic agent used to treat bladder instability that recently has received attention in clinical studies on enuresis. These medications may play a role in the treatment of PNE.As a condition that has no single etiology and various causal factors in any one patient, it is not surprising that a single method of treating nocturnal enuresis is often of limited success. Age-related strategies that combine more than one treatment may improve response rates.For young children and their parents, reassurance and education about enuresis are of utmost importance. They must understand that nocturnal wetting is not the child's fault. There is no place for ridicule or a punitive approach to the problem by parents, siblings,or peers. Previously described motivational and behavioral methods that assist the child in waking to void and that praise successful dryness suit this age group best.For children who still have nocturnal enuresis at this age and for whom the child and family request an intervention, the enuresis alarm gives the best results in terms of response rate and low relapse rate. This also is the age at which intermittent use of medication such as DDAVP can be useful for special events such as an overnight at a friend's home or a camping trip.Because of the emotional impact of persistent bed-wetting in adolescence, aggressive intervention is indicated. If use of an enuresis alarm does not stop or greatly reduce the wetting episodes, continuous use of medication is justified as additional treatment. When 2 months of dryness using the combination of alarm and medication are achieved, the medication should be tapered gradually while continuing to use the enuresis alarm.Assessments of treatment results of enuresis must consider the rate of initial response, the duration of response, and the relapse rate. In general, studies comparing an alarm system with placebo or drug therapy show the alarm system to have the most favorable combination of initial response rate (60% to 70%) and relapse rate (10% to 30%), especially when dryness is assessed at 12 months after initiating treatment. The success rate with alarms, of course, depends on continued use of the alarm. A significant number of families (30% to 50%) discontinue use of the alarm within only 2 to 3 weeks. Studies evaluating medication alone compared with placebo show favorable initial response(10% to 60%), but a significant relapse rate (80% to 90%) when the child is off medication. Two studies documented identical rates of 56% of children maintaining dryness after 12 months' use of an alarm system. In both studies,the rate of dryness after 12 months when using medication alone, either imipramine or DDAVP, was no better than the expected improvement rate of about 15% with no treatment.Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem seen by the primary care physician. It remains a source of considerable anxiety for the child, parents, and sometimes the pediatrician. In spite of several decades of research, no single explanation or classification of enuresis is sufficient. The nocturnal wetting episode occurs when the child does not awaken during sleep at a time when urine volume exceeds functional bladder capacity, due either to excess urine production, small bladder capacity, or both. This perspective requires the practitioner to take a careful history for polyuria, sleep dysfunction, and daytime bladder symptoms to devise the best treatment for each child. Once organic causes are ruled out by careful history and physical examination, no laboratory or radiographic evaluation is necessary beyond a simple urinalysis. Although a spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year can be expected, intervention may benefit some children through earlier attained dryness and improved self-esteem. Behavior therapies, including alarm systems, have the best long-term results, but they require strong family commitment and do not offer immediate results. Medication has a better short-term cure rate than motivational/behavioral therapy, but relapse rates are high when drugs are discontinued. A combination of behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy is reasonable if monotherapy fails. The ultimate goal is for the child to maintain nighttime dryness or to self-awaken to void at night.",

Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them.

      "title": "Psychosomatic Aspects of Urinary Incontinence in Women",
      "abstract": "Urinary incontinence in women is a common problem. With increasing age its prevalence and severity of its manifestations increase. Among nursing home residents the frequency is between 43 and 77 %, 6 to 10 % of all admissions to nursing homes are due to urinary incontinence. The risk for urinary incontinence among women with cognitive deficits is 1.5- to 3.4-fold higher than for women without mental disorders. The most common form is stress incontinence (50 %), followed by mixed stress-urge incontinence (40 %) and purely urge incontinence (OAB = overactive bladder, 20 %). With regard to its cause, the latter remains unclarified in about 80 % of the cases. It is often difficult to treat. There are also cases in which urge incontinence is related to traumatic events. In such cases behavioural and psychotherapeutic options may be helpful. Almost inevitably every form of incontinence has psychological consequences: shame and insecurity are often results of uncontrolled loss of urine. Among others, in the long term, they lead to the avoidance of social contacts and possibly to depression and isolation. Consideration of the psychosomatics is important in the therapy for female urinary incontinence from three points of view: 1) the efficacy of treatment is better suited to the patient, 2) the treatment costs are lower, 3) the professional satisfaction of the responsible physician increases.Harninkontinenz bei der Frau ist ein häufiges Problem. Mit dem Alter steigt ihre Prävalenz und die Schwere ihrer Ausprägung. Bei Bewohnerinnen von Pflegeheimen beträgt die Häufigkeit 43–77 %, 6–10 % der Heimeinweisungen erfolgen wegen Harninkontinenz. Das Risiko für eine Harninkontinenz ist bei Frauen mit kognitivem Defizit um den Faktor 1,5–3,5 erhöht gegenüber Frauen mit ungestörter mentaler Funktion. Die häufigste Harninkontinenz ist die Belastungsinkontinenz (50 %), gefolgt von der gemischten Belastungs-Drang-Inkontinenz (40 %) und der reinen Dranginkontinenz (ÜAB = überaktive Blase, 20 %). Letztere bleibt hinsichtlich ihrer Ursache in ca. 80 % der Fälle ungeklärt. Sie ist gelegentlich schwierig zu behandeln. Es gibt Fälle, in denen eine Dranginkontinenz im Zusammenhang steht mit traumatisierenden Ereignissen. Dann können zusätzliche verhaltenstherapeutische und psychotherapeutische Ansätze hilfreich sein. Fast zwangsläufig hat jede Form von Inkontinenz psychische Folgen: mit unkontrolliertem Urinverlust sind häufig Scham und Unsicherheit verbunden. Sie führen u. U. langfristig zur Vermeidung von sozialen Kontakten, und evtl. zu Depressivität und Vereinsamung. Unter 3 Gesichtspunkten ist die Berücksichtigung der Psychosomatik bei der Therapie der weiblichen Inkontinenz wichtig: 1. die Effizienz der Behandlung wird der Patientin besser gerecht, 2. die Kosten der Behandlung sinken, 3. die Arbeitszufriedenheit der behandelnden Ärzte und Ärztinnen steigt.",

The biological effects of vibrations depend on the frequency, amplitude, and duration of the vibration. The most unfavorable are those with a frequency of 100-250 and an amplitude of .005 mm. General vibrations over a prolonged period of time lead to a typical syndrome of vegetative dysfunction and angiodystonic effects on a neurological basis. In the cardiovascular system, these effects are normally in the form of spastic reactions and perinephritis. The genital system function is particularly sensitive to vibrative disruptions, increasing with the frequency of the vibrations (such as with vehicle operators). Menstrual dysfunction is the most common of such disruptions. The cardiac, nervous, and muscular types of anomalies are well documented. What is now encouraged is research into prophylatic measures to prevent such disruptions.",

Most salient were deficiencies in memory; patient was amnestic to tests shortly after administration. Striking emotional lability/frequent bouts of laughing disproportionate to the conversation and social comportment inappropriate to the setting were present.To our knowledge, amnestic events preceding ACoA aneurysm rupture have not been reported, and perhaps the symptoms this patient experienced prior to the event were indeed prodromal in nature.

      "abstract": "All those involved in the care of babies need to maintain a high index of suspicion regarding the possibility of seizures. Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

Seizures are well known to occur at the onset of intracerebral hemorrhage and serve as a clinical marker. Onset seizures may be focal or generalized, are usually brief, and are associated with loss of consciousness in the setting of hemorrhage. A similar concept of immediate seizure occurs in traumatic brain injury. Predictive factors of ES can be classified of general and neurologic origin. An important question is whether ES per se worsen prognosis and outcome. The viability of the penumbral region in animal models of focal ischemia is influenced by the peri-infarct depolarization waves. If this also is true in humans, seizures in the immediate poststroke period might worsen outcome. Recently, hypercholesterolemia has been associated with better functional outcome at 1 month after a first-ever stroke, and multivariate analysis studies have shown that mean cholesterol values were lower in patients with ES compared with controls.",

There is an emergency when this is felt by any of the protagonists: the patient, the doctor or the entourage. The response in the environment can be indifferent, aggravating or pacifying. The behavioural outbursts in the agitated and aggressive situations necessitate a symptomatic treatment of the agitation, investigation of the underlying somatic or psychiatric pathology, and an evaluation of the milleu often at the origin of the aggravation or agitation. New types of emergency psychiatric consultations are currently being observed, underlaid by outbursts of anxieties and anguish, and this occuring across the board. Patients with diverse pathological anxieties arrive in the emergency department with an imperative demand to be relieved. Thus psychiatirc emergency go from behavioural to more intra-psychi situations, and necessitate an evaluation and an immediate response.",

      "abstract": "Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) is a syndrome characterized by chronic pain and/or stiffness in the neck, shoulders or upper arms and hips. It affects adult patients usually over 50 years old and is treated with low-dose oral corticosteroids. In this case, a 68-year-old female with a history of PMR, diagnosed by a specialist sporadically seen in the past, presented to a primary care physician due to herpes zoster (HZ) infection. Thorough history taking, along with a careful review of previous laboratory results, raised serious doubts concerning her diagnosis (PMR). Because the patient described diffuse pain throughout her body, sleep disturbances and a depressed emotional state, fibromyalgia was suspected instead and appropriate treatment was given. The patient remained free of symptoms and corticosteroids for almost a year. Information from this case may help to point out that PMR is a disorder that can be easily confused with other chronic pain conditions with similar manifestations, especially when the initial diagnosis is sped up in terms of consultation depth and care continuity. Under certain circumstances, primary care can lead to improved clinical outcomes.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

Thirty patients have been studied with this discharge as the chief complaint and 8 patients presenting various nervous complaints in addition. These patients usually showed few or no pus cells in urethral or prostatic smears. Patients have been reported only in whom a definite psychiatric diagnosis was possible, as follows in order of frequency: reactive depression, anxiety state, hysteria, prepsychotic personality, and psychopathic personality. Previous personality characteristics were frequently as follows: excessive conscientiousness, excessive shyness, tendency to drift on the line of least resistance, hypochondriasis, and excessive dependency. Usually the sexual activity was that of continence with an occasional lapse always followed by guilt feelings. The discharge often developed after a period of continence with temptation, excepting in a proportion of cases in which it represented the persistence of an originally infective discharge. Its onset or persistence could usually be correlated with the psychiatric history. Twenty-eight patients were given psychiatric treatment, mostly psychotherapy at a fairly superficial level. Short term follow-up indicated improvement in the local condition as well as the psychiatric disorder, although failures occurred and risks were involved. Probable mechanisms have been discussed in relation to the relevant literature.",

Case Description: Male, 62 years old, with chief of complaint of mouth dropped to the right since 1 day before admission. Complaints made the patient speak more difficult, slow and unable to form sentences. Physical examination show parese CN. VII UMN dextra. Siriraj score -5 and Head NCCT show cerebral infarction in the internal capsula interna. Patient was diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Discussion: The use of a scoring system can be useful when there are no brain imaging facilities that can clearly distinguish the causative pathology of stroke. criteria for diagnosis of ischemic stroke are symptoms of global neurological deficits or one / several focal neurological deficits that occur suddenly with evidence of brain imaging images (CT scan or MRI). The most common differential diagnosis is hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusion. Early recognition and appropriate treatment is important to cure acute ischemic stroke to achieve good quality of life and prevent further infarct to brain tissue.

While factitious disorder and malingering are usually acknowledged as contrived psychiatric conditions for acquisition of interior or exterior profits, respectively, another alternative, also, exists that though is not manufactured individually, is enforced peripherally. Such cases, which are usually referred by the judge’s ruling, for evaluation and treatment, are more important than comparable simulated or genuine mental conditions, because incorrect diagnosis, or careless, cagily, and guarded validation of preliminary diagnosis that has been issued in the authorized or emergency department, can seriously endanger the individual’s civil rights, while it should not be overlooked that incorrect diagnosis is a kind of malpractice that may harm an individual awfully.

ED can be distinguished as a pure psychogenic, organic and mixed disorder (4) .Potency is the ability to attain and maintain a functional /rigid erection and is best characterized by axial rigidity rather than hemodynamic parameter (5-7). Some clinical studies have shown that potency is not always associated with normal hemodynamics or vice-versa Therefore other factors may also be responsible for rigid erection. This disparity between penile rigidity and hemodynamic erectile response is because of expandability of erectile tissue as described by Udelson et al -(6-8) .

Drugs are both major precipitants and baseline risk factors for confusion. Evidence of normal function throughout the day and night is essential to exclude a diagnosis of confusion. Individuals at high risk of acute confusion need to be identified when hospitalisation, surgery, or the introduction of new medication is being planned. The first steps in management of confusion are to make the diagnosis early and then to list all contributing factors. Delaying potentially helpful test in the hope that the confused patient will be more cooperative later is usually futile. Worsening of confusion suggests incorrect or incomplete diagnoses of contributing factors, use of wrong or contraindicated medications, or the development of complications. Minimising predisposing and iatrogenic precipitants (particularly drugs), combined with early detection and treatment of all reversible factors in a therapeutic nursing environment, provides the best outcome.

The diagnosis of dementia is based on: 1) a history of persistent and progressive decline; 2) cognitive scores in one or more tests that fall beyond 2 SD’s from age and education-matched ranges; 3) change in scores that exceed 1 SD within a 6-12 month test/retest period; 4) scores below 36 in the Mini-mental State Exam are considered abnormal; 5) patients should be retesting in 12-18 months. The cognitive rehabilitation of elderly people requires specific programs.",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters.

To establish an accurate composite diagnosis, the urologist must be familiar with the many emotional and organic factors influencing sexual function. Research being carried on at various centers involves efforts toward better differentiation, or linkage, of psychogenic and organic impotence. The author has previously reported acceptable rates of successful therapy of psychogenic impotency in men. The technique consists essentially of attentive listening and emotional support. Treatment usually can be accomplished within three sessions at weekly intervals–a much shorter time than that involved in other current methods. Psychogenic impotency may be treated primarily by the urologist, or he may refer the patient to an appropriate consultant. Not all patients require or will respond to the same therapeutic approach.",

Here, in the hypothalamus and the thalamus, additional processing takes place before the information is translated into the sensation of \"pain.\" The subjective feeling of pain may be influenced by further factors such as distraction. In principle, the production of pain can be modulated, either amplified or reduced, at all of the aforementioned levels.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic pain syndromes are often treatment refractory and pose an enormous burden of suffering for the individual. Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is generally defined as noncyclic pain of at least 6 months duration and severe enough to require medical care or cause disability. CPP has been estimated to have a prevalence of 15% among women of reproductive age. Women are at increased risk for both major depression and chronic pain syndromes such as CPP, and are more likely to report antecedent stressful events, have higher rates of physical and sexual abuse, and subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder. High rates of sexual and physical abuse and other trauma have been shown among women with CPP, including symptoms of dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation), and vulvar pain. A detailed and comprehensive evaluation of the patient with CPP should include a thorough gynecologic exam and a full mental health assessment. Treatment of CPP must include an integrated approach targeted at both the psychiatric comorbidity and pain symptoms. A multidisciplinary treatment team offers the best chance for success with CPP, and it is critical to suggest psychiatric treatment (psychopharmacology and/or psychotherapy) in addition to traditional medical and surgical approaches.",

Controversy arises in those cases in which the noose is too tight, has too many turns or uses an atypical slipknot. Controversy also arises with regard to complete ligature marks, when the hanging is not possible from a sitting or kneeling position, or when there is no dribbling of saliva from the corner of the mouth, especially when there is suspicion of postmortem hanging. At times, it can be very difficult to determine whether the death was suicidal, homicidal or accidental in nature. The latter can often be differentiated on the basis of evidence at the scene of the crime, but problems arise in cases of suicidal/homicidal hanging, and in differentiating between antemortem and postmortem hanging.

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "title": "Supplementary Material for: Post-Stroke Apathy: An Exploratory Longitudinal Study",
      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "title": "Gender and Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a ubiquitous term we use to refer to transient feelings of low mood or sadness that are occasional responses to the stresses of daily life. However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

DSM-5 Proposed Criteria for NSSI requires an individual to engage in intentional self-inflicted damage to the surface of his/her body, on 5 or more days in the last 1 year, with the expectation that the injury will lead to only mild or moderate physical harm.

Dichos sintomas varian desde la ansiedad e irritabilidad moderadas, hasta la depresion severa. Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

      "title": "Is musical hallucination an otological phenomenon? a review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Musical hallucination is the subjective experience of hearing music, or aspects of music, when none is being played, and as such is a disorder of the processing of complex sounds. Objective of Review: To determine the extent to which the otological system is responsible for musical hallucination, and to evaluate approaches to clinical management. Type of Review: A review of all studies and literature reviews pertaining to musical hallucination, supplemented by inclusion of informative case reports. Search Strategy: A systematic search of multiple databases carried out on 22nd March 2009 was complemented by referral to the reference lists of included manuscripts. Results: Although not always troublesome in itself, musical hallucination can be a marker of underlying pathology in the ear or brain, or indicate obsessive‐compulsive traits or social isolation, and is likely to be clinically underreported. Associations have been reported with hearing loss, female gender, social isolation and being over 60 years of age, although it is rare even in this group, and these may well not be independent risk factors. Robust comparative analysis of these factors with controls has yet to be undertaken. Underlying causes include neurovascular pathology, psychiatric disorders and opioid medications, however these are absent in the majority of cases. Conclusions: This review supports the proposal that the otological system plays a role in the pathogenesis of musical hallucination. Hearing impairment may act as an initiating factor, and the primary dysfunction is overactivity of auditory association cortex, although an impairment of higher‐level inhibition does also seem necessary. Once underlying sinister causes have been excluded, first line treatment should be explanation of the condition and optimisation of hearing. Medications have a role only in selected patient groups.",

There was no tendency toward anticipatory symptoms according to age, sex, race, educational level, disease, or type of chemotherapy. Thoughts of chemotherapy, sights, specific odors and tastes evoked anticipatory symptoms. Pre-treatment or anticipatory nausea and vomiting are probably a manifestation of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning.",

      "title": "Child Abuse Syndrome (CAS): A Newly Recognized Distinct Entity",
      "abstract": "A number of children and adolescents experience stressful events during their life spans, which can affect them both physically and emotionally. Their reactions to these events are usually time-limited, as most of these children recover without further problems. However, a child or an adolescent may experience a severe traumatic event, including situations where someone's life (especially parents’ lives) is threatened or where major injuries occur (e.g., victims or witnesses of physical/sexual abuse or of violence in the home or community, of a car accident, a natural disaster or a war event, or the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness); in these cases, the risk of developing a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) becomes more likely, and is directly related to the severity of the trauma experienced, to the likelihood of the trauma being repeated, and, when the trauma affects a child’s relative, also to the child’s relationship with the victim [1, 2].\r\n\r\nThe American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) has recently proved that PTSD related to sexual abuse in children can manifest itself with unique clinical patterns, including specific signs and symptoms of varying degrees of intensity: losing interest in activities which normally gave them joy or pleasure, a regression to thumb-sucking, bedwetting or other age-inappropriate behaviors, also including loss of talking skills. Other leading hallmarks are the tendency to repeat some forms of behavior previously perpetrated against themselves; the development of a strong attachment to a parent or toward another reference figure; the manifestation of unusual fears regarding early death; and severe concentration problems interfering with learning or social activities. Additional potential consequences in adult life include suicidal thinking, active engagement in suicidal behavior and the onset of addictive relationships to food, alcohol or drugs [3, 4].\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years, increasing evidence of the changes in brain structure and function occurring in abused children suffering from PTSD have been recorded by neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, PECT) and neurophysiological (EEG, ERP) studies on large cohorts, mainly including changes in the frontal-limbic networks, the hippocampus and the amygdala [5, 6]. In addition, clinical and molecular geneticists have suggested and demonstrated that abused children who develop PTSD experience a biologically specific form of the disorder different from those caused by other types of trauma, including distinct genomic alterations and unique epigenetic DNA methylation profiles [7, 8].\r\n\r\nAccording to this recent clinical, neuroimaging, neurophysiological, genomic and epigenetic evidence, independently reported by separate teams of researchers, we propose that, for a better and more accurate clinical and diagnostic evaluation and understanding of the clinical phenotype, the overall manifestations and symptoms caused by child abuse be regarded as a specific and distinct entity, grouped under the term of “Child Abuse Syndrome” (CAS).",

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders. (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) The goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms and reduce anxiety, with improvement in overall function.",

      "abstract": "Stalkers can be loosely divided into those without a mental disorder (usually disgruntled ex-partners) and those who are mentally disordered. Although the former group is by far the larger, very little is known about the characteristics of those stalkers. The mentally disordered group comprises mainly those with erotomanic delusions, presenting either as a primary illness or secondary to another mental illness. The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

      "title": "Expanding the Boundaries of Early Intervention for Psychosis: Intervening During the Prodrome",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;It has long been recognized that subclinical manifestations of schizophrenia are evident prior to the onset of full psychosis. This period of time, during which changes in behavior begin to emerge and then progress into more specific early signs and symptoms prior to the onset of frank psychosis, is conceptualized as the “prodrome” or “prodromal stage” of schizophrenia. The term prodrome is somewhat of a misnomer, given the connotation that illness will inevitably follow. Despite this semantic problem, the label is in wide use and in this context suggests only the potential for later development of psychosis or schizophrenia. Verification that an individual is truly at-risk for psychosis (or is in the prodromal stage) can only be determined by following subjects over time. Therefore, putatively prodromal individuals are referred to as being at “ultra high risk” or “clinical high risk” for the development of psychotic disorders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea M.

      "abstract": "undiagnosed.It has been estimated that 75 percent of adults >65 years of age has sleep disturbance and 30 percent of them has insomnia.The classification of insomnia has less significance in the older adults as the subtypes demonstrate significant overlap and usually treatment of the underlying disorder does not solve the problem or cure it.The elderly has multiple comorbidities and poly pharmacy with a myriad of cause for insomnia.A comprehensive medical and psychiatric history together with a complete physical examination and mental state examination should be done in the evaluation of the older patient.Behavioural therapy with sleep hygiene education should be the initial treatment together with the treatment of the contributing physical and psychiatric conditions.Referral to an expert for cognitive behavioural therapy or multicomponent therapy may be necessary if the initial therapy failed to produce any improvement.If medications are needed it can be combined with behavioural therapy.Medication used term use of not more than four weeks.Medications used need to be discontinued gradually and one needs to be mindful of rebound insomnia upon withdrawal.Whenever possible, it will be ideal to avoid benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics as first choice for insomnia.Over the counter sleep aids which usually contain antihistamines may not be good choices as they carry significant risk of adverse events and drug interactions.Currently the safest medications for use in the elderly includes the Z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone), melatonin and low dose tricyclic antidepressant Doxepin.",

      "title": "Cambios en la psicopatología del trastorno limítrofe de la personalidad, en los pacientes tratados con psicoterapia psicodinámica",
      "abstract": "Summary There are very few studies on the changes in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) treated with psychodynamic psychotherapy, around the world, and as far as we know, this is the first report in Mexico on this subject. The main features of this disorder appear at 18 years of age (75% females; 25% males) and are frequent crises characterized by impulsivity (physical figths, substance abuse, suicide or selfmutilating behavior), affective instability (episodes of depression, anxiety and anger) and alterations in identity (sudden changes in values, vocational or laboral goals) that consume a lot of health resources and contribute to many failures in academic and work performance. Its treatment always needs some form of individual or group psychotherapy, with medication at times. In most of the clinical settings this disorder is considered as untractable or to take years to produce beneficial modifications. According to the epidemiological studies of several countries, this disorder appears in 1.1 to 4.6% in the general population, in 10% of the patients in ambulatory mental health centers, in 20% of the hospitalized psychiatric patients and in 30 to 60% of the patients with personality disorders. In a clinical psychiatric population in the Central Military Hospital (Mexico City) the prevalence was 35.7%. This paper reports changes observed in the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder treated by therapists trained in the Kernberg’s manualized psychodynamic psychotherapy, delivered in two weekly 45 minutes sessions, videorecorded and supervised once a week by experts. As for the therapists that participated in the study, four were psychoanalysts with a mean experience of 12 years (D.E. = 1.15) and 10 psychotherapists with a mean experience of 4.67 years (D.E. = 4.23). The experience of both groups of therapists was significately different (U = 7.5, p,.002). Nineteen patients were treated: four males and 15 females who met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria. Measurements of the psychopathology and global functioning were made at the beginning of the treatment, and every 24 sessions during a two years period, using the Clarkin’s Dimensional Scale of the DSM IV Borderline Personality Disorder, and the DSM IV Global Assessment of Functioning. The results were: a) Eleven patients no longer met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria at the 72 nd session measurement, b) there was a positive change in the severity of the psychopathology in all criteria along time, c) the impulsivity criteria disappeared at the 24 th session evaluation; affective instability criteria almost disappeared at the 48 th session evaluation, while identity alterations criteria had only minimal changes even in those patients that remained in treatment for almost two years, d) the gaining in the Global Assessment of Functioning from the beginning to the 72 nd session measurement was 70% and, f) there were no significative differences between the type of therapist and the improvement of the patient in the measurements. These results should be replicated and contrasted with randomized and comparative studies between this type of therapy and supportive psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, group therapy and medication in patients of other social classes treated by residents in psychiatry and clinical psychologists before making available this therapy to a wider patients population.",

      "title": "The Explanation of Impulsive Action",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Impulsive action, such as binge eating or drinking, wrist‐slashing, compulsive promiscuity or chronically explosive marital conflict, presents serious problems for psychoanalysis. Such action evokes explanations both from the analyst and from the patient. The analyst may be held captive by explanatory notions that emphasise one aspect of impulsive action rather than the whole process. These explanations are based on our notions of drive pressure, adaptation, control and attack of intimate persons, ‘acting out,’ and the ‘compulsion to repeat’. The patient's explanations may be either consciously stated or inferred by the analyst as unconscious‘explanations’from associative material. If the patient's explanations dovetail with or adapt to those of the analyst, the analyst may take them as confirmatory, and the whole process of breakdown and restitution may escape analytic scrutiny. This process includes: (1) a precipitant that is narcissistically wounding; (2) a prodrome consisting of an experience of lack or absence which the patient feels as persecution, and a restitutive phantasy of the lack as fillable by a consummatory act; (3) the act itself; (4) character defences that ward off mortification on awareness of personal disintegration (shame) or the consequences of the act (guilt); explanations emphasising guilt often screen those giving rise to shame; (5) an attempt to regulate distance to protect against narcissistic injury by keeping intimates from getting too close or too far away. The therapist's tendencies to overemphasise the precipitant, the meaning of the act, or its distance regulating may convey an attitude of blame rather than understanding. Therapeutic emphasis on the subjective experience in an unintegrated way is sympathy, not empathy; sympathy is collusive and fosters splitting and impedes working with the negative transference. Blame or sympathy may be buttressed by the type of explanation accepted by analyst and patient. Explanatory preconceptions must be transcended to do effective interpretive work. Interpretation should convey understanding of a preoccupied ego that manifests its disorganising and restitutive propensities in the process of impulsive action.",

This means that homosexual tendencies are repressed, or actualized through an imaginary elaboration or a symbolic one, by staying unconscious or manifesting through acting in a state of obnubilation. These different situations are illustrated by sexual dysfunctions (some forms of impotence and frigidity), hostile rejection and homosexual panic, jalousy, triolism and alcoholic aspects.

Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

      "title": "Review of Delusional Jealousy and Its Association with Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Introduction Mental state changes can affect one’s sexual life, while sexual dysfunction can lead to relationship challenges. Delusional jealousy, also called Othello syndrome, involves a paranoid belief in a partner’s infidelity, leading to controlling and violent behaviors. It can manifest as a paranoid disorder, as a delusional symptom of psychiatric, neurological or other medical conditions, or as side effect of dopaminergic medication. Although its exact prevalence remains uncertain, it has been identified in 0.5-1.4% of psychiatry inpatients. Objectives To describe sexual dysfunctions associated with delusional jealousy and to explore strategies for addressing these dysfunction. Methods A non-systematic review of the literature available at PubMed was conducted using the keywords “Sexual Dysfunction” AND “Delusional Jealousy OR Othello Syndrome”. Results A number of factors, including sexual dysfunction, can trigger or exacerbate delusional jealousy. This is especially true for middle-aged men who have a history of alcohol consumption, neurological or personality disorders. Individuals with sexual dysfunction experience feelings of insecurity, projecting these concerns onto their partners and suspecting extramarital relationships. On the other hand, sexual dysfunctions such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Female Sexual Arousal and Orgasmic Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction and Ejaculation Disturbance may occur as consequence of Othello Syndrome. Multiple factors contribute to these dysfunctions, including increased testosterone and cortisol levels, chronic alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric conditions and antipsychotics. There are reports of increased sexual desire, especially in cases of dementia. Conclusions Although the evidence is limited and dated, it points to a bidirectional association between delusional jealousy and sexual dysfunction. Further studies are essential to determine the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunctions in Othello syndrome, and the causal relationship between them. Additionally, investigating gender differences is crucial, given the male-centric focus of existing studies. This research can contribute to clinical care by promoting the screening for sexual issues and their integration into delusional jealousy management. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Seizures are either focal (partial) or generalized in onset (Table I).1 The manifestation of the seizure is related to the area of the brain involved in the initial electrical seizure discharge. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the motor strip then one might see a Jacksonian type of seizure with first clonic movements of the thumb and fingers, then a march up the hand, arm, face and leg on the contralateral side of the body. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the temporal lobe then one might see impairment of consciousness and automatic movements (automatisms). The \"aura\" is actually the start of the electrical seizure discharge which is confined to one area of brain. The type of \"aura\" that a patient has is related to the area of brain involved in the seizure discharge. For example, the olfactory aura of an unusual smell may be related to a mesial temporal lobe or mesial frontal lobe discharge. The aura of an unusual taste is related to a discharge in the insular cortex. If the electrical seizure discharge spreads out to involve other areas of brain or the whole brain then the patient has a secondarily generalized major motor seizure. The important point is to recognize that the seizure was a partial onset seizure becoming secondarily generalized and therefore due to a focal etiology rather than a primary generalized seizure disorder, which affects a particular area of brain which is may be precipitated in response to some stimuli which effects a particular area of brain which is extraordinarily sensitive because of an epileptic lesion in that area.

Many of the narrative plots described in earlier chapters have been rich in images and clearly co-created among participants. Not all clinical time is like this. A narrative orientation to therapeutic actions is always in tension with another structure of clinical action which resists emplotment. One sees narrative interruptions – plots that begin, a story that seems to develop between therapist and patient but is subverted, and often by the therapist.",

      "abstract": "Complex motor behaviors can be a challenge for even a seasoned physician. Opinions may be divided when behaviors occur out of sleep as general tendency is to categorize them as a parasomnia. A 43 y/o female with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was referred for a sleep study. She had severe OSA and a subsequent PAP titration study was performed. At 6 am, she had an arousal from N2 sleep with abduction of arms followed by writhing in bed. It was followed by flailing of arms in air with deviation of the eyes to the right. Later patient exhibited fast circling movements of the arms with chewing movements. Episode lasted for 25 seconds. Immediately after, patient was able to answer questions appropriately and walk without any difficulty suggesting no confusion. Limited EEG (done with PSG) was mostly obscured by muscle artifact and no clear epileptiform discharges could be discerned. No other abnormal EEG activity was noted during this sleep study prior to this event. She had similar behavior without any post event confusion on her sleep study 12 years ago. Patient demographic, clinical semiology and PSG/EEG features have been proposed to distinguish nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) seizures from parasomnias, validated guidelines are still missing. The short-lasting motor events cannot always be established as epileptic nature, on the basis of one event of clinical phenomena, but the recurrence of these similar observed movements in individuals can be used as an indirect marker of epileptic etiology. Distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from parasomnias is critical from pathophysiological relationship but has treatment implications. This case illustrates importance of reviewing clinical history and behavior semiology that was recorded as well as limitations of the ancillary testing such as polysomnography or EEG monitoring.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is significantly higher among patients with epilepsy than the general population. Moreover, the profile of depressive disorder is often atypical in patients with epilepsy. Data from human and animal studies have tended to point towards a bidirectional link in the pathophysiological basis of both epilepsy and depressive syndrome. Depressive symptoms in epilepsy can be divided into those occurring in the peri-ictal period (pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal), and those occurring in the inter-ictal period. Peri-ictal depressive disorders are particularly associated with temporal lobe epilepsies. These include: (i) peri-ictal dysphoria, (symptoms occur in the 24 hour period preceding a seizure); (ii) ictal depression, (symptoms develop during the seizure); (iii) post-ictal depression, (symptoms occur in the 72 hours following the seizure). The inter-ictal depressive disorders are not temporally related to seizures. The best characterized of these is ‘‘inter-ictal dysphoric disorder’’. This includes labile depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anergia, pain, insomnia), labile affective symptoms (panic-like symptoms and anxiety), and supposedly ‘‘specific’’ symptoms (paroxysmal irritability and instable-euphoric moods). Standard psychiatric classification may be inadequate to describe some of the atypical profiles seen in this patient population. Depression in patients with epilepsy is therefore under-diagnosed, and yet contributes to poorer quality of life, epilepsy outcome and risk of suicide. It is recommended that an appropriate screening tool be used to detect signs of major depression, the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E). Clinicians should recognize the characteristics of peri-ictal and inter-ictal depressive syndromes. 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

      "abstract": "Psychogene Bewegungsstörungen machen bis zu 5% aller Bewegungsstörungen in spezialisierten Ambulanzen aus. Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

The interviewer should list and rate each obsession identified by the child using the Feelings Thermometer. Meanwhile, in assessing for compulsions, the frequency of the repetitive behavior is rated. Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, which are repetitive and difficult to control, and/or compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day). In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning. Recognition by the child that the symptoms are excessive or unreasonable is not necessary to make the diagnosis in children.",

      "title": "A Chronic Canine Model of Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder that is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep (1-3). Upper airway closure results in reduction or cessation of breathing, leading to progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnia and increasing inspiratory efforts against the occluded airway. These stimuli ultimately provoke arousal from sleep, which leads to restoration of upper airway patency and resumption of breathing. An increasing body of clinical and epidemiological literature indicates that the sleep fragmentation and recurrent hypoxemia associated with OSA lead to a host of important neuropsychological, cardiovascular, respiratory control, and other disturbances, which in turn result in substantial morbidity and mortality (3-5). However, the investigation of the mechanisms by which these complications are produced has been hampered by the methodologic restrictions inherent to investigations involving humans, and by the fact that once the human condition comes to clinical attention, it has typically been present for some time. It is therefore difficult to determine which abnormalities represent a primaryfactor contributing to the disorder, a secondary complication of it, or an indirectly associated comorbidity.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Spastic paraplegia 3A (SPG3A; also known as ATL1-HSP) is characterized by progressive bilateral and mostly symmetric spasticity and weakness of the legs. Compared to other forms of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), in which diminished vibration sense (caused by degeneration of the corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns) and urinary bladder hyperactivity are present in all affected individuals, these findings occur in a minority of individuals with SPG3A. The average age of onset is four years. More than 80% of reported individuals manifest spastic gait before the end of the first decade of life. Most persons with early-onset ATL1-HSP have a pure (uncomplicated) HSP; however, complicated HSP with axonal motor neuropathy and/or distal amyotrophy with lower motor neuron involvement (Silver syndrome phenotype) have been observed. The rate of progression in ATL1-HSP is slow, and wheelchair dependency or need for a walking aid (cane, walker, or wheelchair) is relatively rare. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ATL1-HSP is established in a proband with suggestive findings and almost exclusively a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATL1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Note: The exceptions are two families with biallelic ATL1 pathogenic variants. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Medical treatment of spasticity may begin with oral baclofen or tizanidine, followed by chemodenervation with botulinum A or B toxins if oral antispasticity medications are not tolerated. Intrathecal baclofen pump may be considered for those who improve on oral baclofen but have significant systemic adverse effects. Medical therapy should be combined with intensive physical therapy focused on stretching and strengthening exercises that may help delay or minimize muscle tendon contractures, scoliosis, and foot deformities. Distal weakness (typically affecting foot dorsiflexion) can be ameliorated by ankle-foot orthoses. Urinary urgency can be treated with anticholinergic antispasmodic drugs. Surveillance: No consensus exists regarding the frequency of clinical follow-up visits, but reevaluation once or twice yearly to identify and treat new complications is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dantrolene, as it can induce irreversible weakness, adversely affecting mobility. Genetic counseling ATL1-HSP is almost exclusively inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. More than 95% of individuals diagnosed with SPG3A have an affected parent; the proportion of individuals with ATL1-HSP caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is currently unknown. Each child of an individual with ATL1-HSP has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the ATL1 pathogenic variant has been identified in a family member with autosomal dominant ATL1-HSP, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Although there are no large-scale, population-based studies of ASD, smaller studies have examined rates of ASD in select populations following a variety of traumatic events. The prevalence of ASD varies widely depending on the type of traumatic event and the population. The highest rates are in victims of sexual assault and violent crime, with more moderate rates in victims of motor vehicle accidents, burns, illness, disaster, war, and terrorism. Female gender, younger age, and a history of prior trauma, PTSD, or other mental health disorders are risk factors for ASD.",

A 25% of the patients referred to epilepsy services have paroxysmal clinical events associated with motor activities, sensory or emotional alterations, or consciousness impairment, which are not epileptic seizures. The non-epileptic seizures can be classified as psychogenic, which do not have a medical cause, and are associated with primary or secondary psychological problems, and as of physiological origin. The non-epileptic events are manifested by paroxysmal or repetitive behaviors that might be confused with epileptic seizures. The diagnosis is very important in order to avoid unnecessary tests and iatrogenic therapies. This study will present clinical cases and review of the main non-epileptic physiological events (sleep disorders, movement disorders, hypoxic-ischemic phenomena) and psychogenic events (somatoform disorders, fictitious disorders and anxiety disorder).",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

With appropriate sensitivity, the interviewer should physically demonstrate motor tics when inquiring about their presence. If duration of tics is less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder or Unspecified Tic Disorder and skip to Vocal Tics. Symptoms must have persisted for at least 1 year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

Il caso da noi riportato riguarda una donna di 21 anni che, dopo aver partorito con taglio cesareo per ipossia acuta fetale, in 7a giornata di puerperio riferisce che “c’e qualcosa che non va”: si dimostra particolarmente stanca, irritata, triste. Nei giorni successivi la sintomatologia si acuisce. Alla consulenza psichiatrica le viene diagnosticata “depressione post-partum moderata” e dopo una terapia per 6 mesi con paroxetina la prognosi e stata buona sia per la madre che per il neonato. I disturbi psichiatrici del post-partum rappresentano un importante problema di sanita pubblica, che puo anche avere conseguenze negative sullo sviluppo fisico e comportamentale, oltre che poter mettere a rischio la vita del neonato (“infanticidio”). Le varie legislazioni europee infliggono una pena minore nei casi di infanticidio, e in Italia la legge che lo regolamenta e l’art. 578 del c.p., riformulato dalla legge n. 42 del 5/8/1981: “La madre che cagiona la morte del proprio neonato immediatamente dopo il parto, o del feto durante il parto, quando il fatto e determinato da condizioni di abbandono materiale e morale connessa al parto, e punita con la reclusione da 4 a 12 anni”. Data quindi la potenziale gravita di questo disturbo, e importante diagnosticarlo in fase precoce ed attuare delle misure terapeutiche appropriate, oltre che supporto psicologico.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

Trauma on a woman's thoughts, feelings, dreams, fantasies, intentions, and relations changing her attitude to life as such, to her nearest, also to the values and eventually to herself. The consequences occurring as uncontrolled chain reaction affect her family life, career and communication; they break her as personality and lead towards destruction. There is always a risk of suicide. In psychiatry, termination of pregnancy is very important as it can be a reason of developing psychopathology. The identified psychopathological symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder which are considered a post-abortion syndrome. Psychopathology is distinguished by its personal, spiritually painful and stigmatized character. In the course of more than thirty years of clinical practice I have met, and medical documentation describes, about five hundred cases of post-abortion syndrome in Lithuania. The problem of termination of pregnancy exposes the tragic situation of family relations and discloses the destructive effects of the lack of love and warmth between nearest and dearest people, the poverty of sexual life, a woman's slavish behavior and dependence on a man.The topic has been highly syigmatized in Lithuania. Case presentation has been discussed.",

      "title": "Perimenopausal Mental Disorders: Epidemiology and Phenomenology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Perimenopause, the interval of irregular menstrual activity which directly precedes menopause, is characterized by widely fluctuating hormone levels amidst a large-scale decline in circulating estrogen. This phase in a woman's life is typically accompanied by physical discomforts including vasomotor symptoms, such as headaches, insomnia, and hot flushes, as well as genital atrophy. Not surprisingly, studies suggest a significant increase in mood lability for women during this time. While some evidence points toward an exacerbation of bipolar mood symptoms and an increase in schizophrenic psychosis during perimenopause, the majority of research conducted on perimenopausal mental disorders has focused on unipolar depression. Studies vary widely in methodology, definitions of menopausal status, and degrees of depression among subjects; however, the majority of findings indicate an increased susceptibility to depression during the perimenopausal transition. This greater susceptibility may be due to neuroendocrine effects of declining estrogen levels, the subjective experience of somatic symptoms resulting from this hormonal decline, and/or the more frequent occurrence of “exit” or “loss” events for women during this stage of life. At this time, more research is needed to address questions of prevalence, risk, and etiology for depression and other major mental disorders as related to the physiological and psychosocial changes associated with perimenopause.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain after hysterectomy in a patient with depressive disorder: A case report",
      "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain, defi ned as a non-cyclic pain of at least 6 months duration, is severe enough to require medical care or to cause disability. For such reason, only physical approaches and managements of chronic pelvic pain sometimes fail. Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can cause chronic pelvic pain and affects the course of pain management. This case is about chronic pelvic pain of 39-years-old unmarried woman with adenomyosis. She wanted to control her pelvic pain with medical treatments of adenomyosis, but finally decided to scarify uterus due to uncontrolled pain. Pshychosomatic symptoms were considered to cause the pain because her pain did not disappear even after hysterectomy. She was diagnosed with PTSD and depression. This case suggests that chronic pelvic pain patients always need psychological evaluation even if they have defi nit e causes of pelvic pain in gynecological area.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

In the vast majority of cases, symptoms resolve within days or weeks. The most common symptoms include: difficulty with concentration and attention, slowed speed of mental processing, anxiety, emotional lability, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache. The statistics regarding postconcussion syndrome vary considerably with the population studied. Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

They can be all named posttraumatic neuropathies: painless sensations in phantom limb ,painful phantom limb and painful posttraumatic stump. Painless sensations in phantom limb can be seen in 90% of cases in resected body parts as soon as first postoperative day, less often during the first week, and its clinical characteristics are usually stabilized during the first year. Painful posttraumatic stump appears because of pain neuroma existing, that forms at the proximal end of amputational stump as a consequence of physiological nerve regeneration attempt. Frequency of pain significantly varies considering authors from 5 - 90%, depending on definition of this phenomena and criteria used. It is considered that 5- 10% mast be under permanent medicament treatment. Phantom pain appears more often in elderly and people with specific affective personality construction. It can bee permanent, burning, nettling, tearing (25%), or intermittent, lancerating, in the shape of electrical discharging (32%), but it can also have bizarre attributes. Phantom pain appearance usually announces its duration in the longer period. After two years it is present at 59% of patients, with decreasing intensity, and only 5- 10% suffer severe pain. In our Institute in the period from 1980-2003, 48 patients have been treated, 36 patients with medicamentous treatment, local blockades and chronic stimulations, and 12 patients, who did not react at conservative treatment were operated.

You have just experienced a startle reflex. The startle reflex (or startle response) is commonly measured in research studies by a blink response in humans, elicited by some startling stimulus such as a loud noise. The blink response is an early and reliable component of startle in humans. It occurs to stimuli in various sensory modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, cutaneous) and often begins within 30 ms after the onset of a sudden and intense stimulus.",

      "abstract": "The taking of a careful history in patients with exophthalmic goiter commonly yields three important facts: (1) Information to the effect that one or more blood relatives is or had been suffering with \"nervousness,\" exophthalmic goiter, or diabetes mellitus; (2) the patient has been of more or less \"nervous\" temperament, characterized by irritability, impatience, fractiousness, and emotionalism, usually since childhood; (3) the onset of the symptoms of the disease followed soon after the occurrence of a psychic trauma. From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript presents working definitions for key clinical course indicators for bipolar disorder, including response, remission, relapse, recurrence, and roughening.A work group of experts in bipolar disorder reviewed prior efforts to define clinical course indicators for unipolar depression and for schizophrenia. Using these efforts as templates, the work group developed consensus operational definitions. The rationale for each of the definitions was a point of time when a treatment decision needed to be made.The group defined response as a 50% reduction in a score from a standard rating scale of symptomatology from an appropriate baseline, regardless of index episode type (manic, depressed, or mixed). In addition, the other pole cannot be significantly worsened during response. Remission was defined as absence or minimal symptoms of both mania and depression for at least 1 week. Sustained remission requires at least eight consecutive weeks of remission, and perhaps as many as 12 weeks. A relapse/recurrence was defined as a return to the full syndrome criteria of an episode of mania, mixed episode, or depression following a remission of any duration. Roughening was defined as a return of symptoms at a subsyndromal level, perhaps representing a prodrome of an impending episode.The work group recommends that all reports of clinical trials in bipolar disorder include results using these definitions. This will introduce standards for such reports. Hopefully, the definitions will be revised and improved over time.",

Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben.

For the purposes of this chapter, moderate adverse sedation-related events represent physiologic change that is extremely likely to lead to significant patient harm if unnoticed or responded to ineffectively by the sedationist. Apnea, airway obstruction, and laryngospasm are examples. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 400 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training so that sedationists can effectively respond to these adverse events or preempt them. Even though they are categorized as “moderate” and may not be associated with harm in and of themselves, these events may certainly progress to produce significant harm.",

Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund. Die Wesensveranderung kann so we it reichen, daB Kleptomanie, Pyromanie, Trunksucht, Nymphomanie und Halluzinationen beobachtet werden. Das pramenstruelle Syndrom gilt in GroBbritannien als strafmildern, in Frankreich gar als zeitweilige Unzurechnungsfahigkeit. Hinsichtlich der Pathophysiologie des pramenstruellen Syndroms gibt es eine Reihe von Hypothesen. Der zeitliche Zusammenhang zwischen der Menstruation und dem Auftreten dieses Syndroms lieB vermuten, daB eine gesWrte Ovarialfunktion mit veranderter Relation von Ostrogenund Progesteronsekretion ursachlich verantwortlich zu machen sei (Backstrom et al. 1976). Eine unzureichende sekretorische Umwandlung des J::ndometriums machte einen relativen Progesteronmangel zusatzlich wahrscheinlich. Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u. Yen 1981). Kritisch ist bei",

In Poland, disability after stroke, affects 70% of patients and is definitely higher than in the other developed countries. Information that stroke affects young, sexually active persons is becoming more and more common, however this aspect of patients' functionality falls into the background, both for patients and specialists, as it seems to be less important than other disorders. These patients report the decrease of all sexual functions such as libido, erectile function, orgasm, vaginal lubrication and sexual satisfaction; the frequency of intercourse decreases significantly. The sexual dysfunction in these patients depends on many factors. Among them, we can distinguish between the extent of the focus of the stroke, the method of treatment and the level of general post-stroke disability. Some of the sexual disfunctions are temporary in the initial period they result mainly neurological deficit (aphasia, movement disorders, paresis, limbs paralysis) later on, psychological factors may start playing a significant role. These disturbances also show some dynamics over time. The etiology of sexual disorders after stroke is multi-functional. There are organic factors and also psychosocial and psychological. Among psychological factors, depression, anxiety and fear that the stroke can come back can lead to the decrease of one's sexual drive. Sexual dysfunction in patients after a stroke may be associated with a malfunction of the genitourinary system, including urinary incontinence. Rehabilitation this patients require interdisciplinary actions.",

Six cases of extreme state dissociation are presented, with a review of the human and animal clinical and experimental literature. This multiple component concept of state determination must be kept in mind when pharmacologic or lesion studies are employed to suppress one or another state. Such manipulation may suppress some of the commonly used markers for that state (i.e., polygraphic) without affecting other variables of that state. The existence of mixed states will be a challenge to the development of automated computerized polysomnogram scoring.",

      "abstract": "Nausea and/or vomiting are aversive gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Nausea and vomiting manifest unconditionally after a nauseogenic experience. However, there is correlative, quasiexperimental and experimental evidence that nausea and vomiting can also be learned via classical (Pavlovian) conditioning and might occur in anticipation of the nauseogenic event. Classical conditioning of nausea can develop with chemotherapy in cancer patients. Initially, nausea and vomiting occur during and after the administration of cytotoxic drugs (post-treatment nausea and vomiting) as unconditioned responses (UR). In addition, 20%-30% of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy report these side effects, despite antiemetic medication, when being re-exposed to the stimuli that usually signal the chemotherapy session and its drug infusion. These symptoms are called anticipatory nausea (AN) and/or anticipatory vomiting (ANV) and are explained by classical conditioning. Moreover, there is recent evidence for the assumption that post-chemotherapy nausea is at least partly influenced by learning. After summarizing the relevant assumptions of the conditioning model, revealing that a context can become a conditioned stimulus (CS), the present paper summarizes data that nausea and/or vomiting is acquired by classical conditioning and, consequently, may be alleviated by conditioning techniques. Our own research has focussed on two aspects and is emphasized here. First, a conditioned nausea model was established in healthy humans using body rotation as the nausea-inducing treatment. The validity of this motion-sickness model to examine conditioning mechanisms in the acquisition and alleviation of conditioned nausea and associated endocrine and immunological responses is summarized. Results from the rotation-induced motion sickness model showed that gender is an important moderator variable to be considered in further studies. This paper concludes with a review of the application of the demonstrated conditioning principles as interventions to ameliorate distressing AN/ANV in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, which is the second focus of our work.",

      "title": "Depression and Cardiac Risk",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among American adults, with lifetime prevalence rates of up to 25% in women and 12% in men, and point prevalence rates of 6% in women and 3% in men.1 These gender differences are relatively constant over adulthood, although there is evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing and the age of first onset is decreasing. Major depressive disorder is even more common among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with estimates ranging from 16% to 27%, and an additional 20% to 30% of cardiac patients with minor depression (mDD) or elevated depressive symptoms.2 Major depressive disorder is best diagnosed by a psychiatric interview. To meet criteria for MDD, a patient must report sad or “depressed” mood or a significant loss of interest in all or most things that were previously considered enjoyable for a minimum of 2 weeks, and at least an additional 4 (or 3, if both dysphoric mood and loss of pleasure are present) of the following symptoms: significant weight loss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Minor depression (mDD) is not yet an official psychiatric diagnosis, but rather is a clinical syndrome often used for research purposes. Its features are similar to MDD, but with fewer depressive symptoms and less impairment. An episode of mDD involves either a sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and a total of at least 2 but less than 5 additional depressive symptoms. Dysthymia is marked by a chronically depressed mood state for at least 2 years. At least 2 additional depressive symptoms are present without meeting criteria for MDD. Self-report instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zung Depression Scale, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) can also reliably assess depressive symptoms, although questionnaires cannot diagnose MDD and should not be considered a substitute for clinical interviews for diagnostic purposes. In this issue of the journal, Todaro and colleagues report that more than 20% of patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) met criteria for a current depressive disorder, including 9.1% for MDD, 6.4% for mDD, and 5.5% for dysthmia. These figures may be somewhat lower than expected, based on previous reports.2 However, the lower estimates may be attributable to the relatively small sample size, selective enrollment (only 82% of eligible CR participants agreed to undergo the psychiatric assessment), and use of an unfamiliar instrument, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, for the diagnosis and severity rating of depression. In addition, it is possible that patients who are referred for CR—and more importantly, follow through with the referral—may not be representative of the general cardiac population. Indeed it has been shown that patients with depression are less likely to adhere to prescribed medical therapies, including participation in CR services.3 More striking, however, was the prevalence of depression among female patients, with 43% of female CR participants meeting criteria for depressive disorder during their lifetimes compared with only 19% among males. Furthermore, almost 29% of women in the study met criteria for a current depressive disorder compared with only 9% of men. These are sobering figures and are significant for a number of important reasons: depression takes a devastating toll on patients' quality of life; adversely affects marital and social relations; results in increased use of social and medical services; is associated with more days in bed or days away from normal activities; and is responsible for enormous financial costs for treatment, lost productivity, and absenteeism from work. In addition, there is mounting evidence that depression is associated with worse prognosis, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in relative risk in patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction (MI),4 congestive heart failure,5 and post—coronary artery bypass surgery.6 Moreover, mDD, dysthymia, and even subclinical depression as measured by elevated scores on self-report instruments such as BDI and CES-D scales are associated with increased risk.2 Thus, not only recognizing depression but also successfully treating it has become a priority. Several recent studies have assessed the extent to which depression can be successfully treated in cardiac populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely considered to be safe for patients with CHD. For example, the SADHART study showed that sertraline did not adversely affect cardiac function and was safe for most patients.7 While non-significant or modest reductions in depressive symptoms were noted in the sample as a whole, evidence suggested that treatment was effective for patients with recurrent or more severe depression. There is also great interest in nonpharmacological approaches to treatment. Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy all have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression in healthy, depressed populations without CHD. In addition, the ENRICHD trial recently showed that similar to antidepressant medication, CBT is modestly effective in reducing depression in acute post-MI patients.8 Evidence suggests that exercise therapy also may be an effective treatment for depression,9 and exercise after an acute MI has recently been reported to be associated with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with MDD,10 suggesting that exercise is a promising intervention for patients with CHD and depression. It remains to be seen whether treating depression may reduce risk of adverse events in depressed CHD patients. Although the ENRICHD trial failed to demonstrate that reducing depression improved survival, antidepressant use was actually associated with better clinical outcomes, independent of the effects on depression. Additional randomized controlled trials need to be undertaken with cardiac patients who are depressed to examine efficacy for psychosocial and “hard” clinical endpoints. It should be noted that because of improvements in the surgical and medical management of patients, it is possible that treating depression may not reduce significantly the risk of death or reinfarction over and above standard risk factors such as CHD severity and the presence of medical cormorbidities. Nevertheless, depression remains a highly prevalent and insidious comorbid condition in cardiac patients and needs to be recognized and treated, if not to prolong life then certainly to enhance patients' quality of life.",

They also summarized all systematic reviews and synthesized the sparse clinical studies to provide diagnostic recommendations, treatment options, and strategies for prevention.The incidence of first-lifetime onset postpartum psychosis/mania from population-based register studies of psychiatric admissions varies from 0.25 to 0.6 per 1,000 births. After an incipient episode, 20%-50% of women have isolated postpartum psychosis. The remaining women have episodes outside the perinatal period, usually within the bipolar spectrum. Presumably, the mechanism of onset is related to physiological changes after birth (e.g., hormonal, immunological, circadian), which precipitate disease in genetically vulnerable women. Some women have treatable causes and comorbidities, such as autoimmune thyroiditis or infections. N-methyl-d-aspartate-encephalitis or inborn errors of metabolism may present after birth with psychosis. Fewer than 30 publications have focused on the treatment of postpartum psychosis. The largest study (N=64) provided evidence that lithium is highly efficacious for both acute and maintenance treatment. Another report (N=34) described successful ECT treatment. Inpatient care is usually required to ensure safety, complete the diagnostic evaluation, and initiate treatment. The relapse risk after a subsequent pregnancy for women with isolated postpartum psychoses is 31% (95% CI=22-42). Strategies for prevention of postpartum psychosis include lithium prophylaxis immediately postpartum and proactive safety monitoring.Postpartum psychosis offers an intriguing model to explore etiologic contributions to the neurobiology of affective psychosis.",

More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age worldwide, along with painful menstruation and genital inflammation. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. A severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which requires psychiatric management. The onset and severity of PMS with multifactorial pathogenesis is triggered by psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms that are influenced by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, altering the neurotransmitter or neuropathway functions of the brain, e.g., the serotoninergic system. The psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms contribute to the development of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms, which are also influenced by the combined presence of other physiological (genetical background, metabolic and chronic inflammatory processes, chronobiological and circadian disorders) and psychological stressors and their interaction.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája világszerte a fájdalmas menstruáció és a nemi szervi gyulladások mellett. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS súlyos formája a pszichiátriában diagnosztizált és kezelt premenstruális dysphoriás zavar (PMDD). A multifaktoriális kóreredetű PMS megjelenését és súlyosságát a hypothalamus–hypophysis–ovarium tengely ciklikus működésének hatására kialakuló pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok indítják el, megváltoztatva az agy neurotranszmitter- vagy neuropeptid-funkcióit, például a szerotoninerg rendszer működését. A pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok hozzájárulnak a fizikai, a pszichológiai és a viselkedésbeli tünetek kialakulásához, melyeket befolyásol még az egyéb fiziológiai (például genetikai háttér, metabolikus és krónikus gyulladásos folyamatok, kronobiológiai és cirkadián működészavarok), illetve pszichikai stresszorok együttes jelenléte, illetve azok egymásra való kölcsönhatása is.

      "title": "From Onset and Prodromal Stage to a Life-Long Course of Schizophrenia and Its Symptom Dimensions: How Sex, Age, and Other Risk Factors Influence Incidence and Course of Illness",
      "abstract": "The core symptoms of psychosis-delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorders-are not unique to the disorder traditionally called schizophrenia. They occur at the early stages of various brain diseases, too. Psychosis seems to be a preformed pattern of response of the human brain. Most schizophrenia onsets are marked by a prodromal stage extending over several years and producing the maximum of social consequences. Schizophrenia incidence shows a steep increase culminating at age 15 to 25 years in males. In females it reaches a first peak at age 15 to 30 years and a second, flatter peak at menopausal age (44-49 years). Thereafter, incidence declines to a plateau at later ages. Unlike what the findings of most large-scale epidemiological studies applying an upper age limit of 45 to 55 years suggest, schizophrenia is a disorder of all ages. The lifetime risk seems to be the same for both sexes. The lower incidence in premenopausal women is accounted for by the downregulating effect of oestrogen on dopamine receptors. This hormonal protective effect is antagonised by the genetic effect of a high familial load. In the long-term illness course, right-censored to 11.2 years following first admission, the number of psychotic relapse episodes ranges from 0 to 29 with a mean of 3. The positive symptom dimension produces the highest number of relapses and the shortest duration of exacerbations with a mean length of two months. The depressive and negative symptom dimensions show exacerbations extending over nearly six months on average. Following the first illness episode symptom scores decline sharply, reaching a plateau five years after first admission. Negative symptoms come to a plateau after 2 to 3 years in females and after 5 years in males. Depression is the most frequent type of symptom in the long-term course. In the light of these results urgent treatment issues will be discussed.",

      "title": "Pain in Animals and Humans: An Introduction",
      "abstract": "No issue in animal research is more sensitive than that of inducing distress in animals. Both the Animal Welfare Act and Health Research Extension Act (1985) require special justification and committee approval before research likely to produce distress in animals is performed. It is therefore imperative that investigators carefully review all aspects of their proposed investigations, with the intention of reducing or eliminating factors that may lead to distress. A variety of factors contribute to distress in the research setting. These factors are commonly termed stressors and are known to elicit typical physiological and/or biochemical responses, for example, stimulation of the adrenocortical axis. While exposure to some stressful events is necessary for normal development, it is the abnormal response to these events, distress, that should be avoided. Whether or not an animal responds to a stressor by manifesting signs of distress depends on the duration and intensity of the stressor as well as the animal's previous experience. One signal of distress, sometimes the only sign, is maladaptive behavior. As a result, special attention must be given to species typical behaviors and abnormalities in these behaviors when attempting to assess the presence or absence of distress. One well recognized stressor is pain. While many scientific investigations can adequately avoid pain, a few types of experiments, especially those involved with testing analgesics, may induce pain. It is particularly important in these studies that the methods chosen appropriately simulate the condition under study in man, that the intensity and duration of the stimulus be the minimum necessary to generate scientifically valid results, and that special attention be given throughout the study to assess the presence of distress in the animal. Animals involved in studies that may lead to severe or chronic pain that is not expected to be relieved by analgesics should be euthanized during or at the conclusion of the procedure. With this in mind, we have invited a number of investigators to submit manuscripts dealing with pain and its assessment and alleviation in humans and nonhuman animals.

      "title": "Autistic phenomena in neurotic patients 1",
      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day.

It is defined as at least two recurrent attacks, lasting from 5 to 60 minutes, of reversible, visual, sensorial and / or language unilateral neurological symptoms. Methods: We present a case report of a male with typical aura without headache. Results: Male with a history of migraine without aura in adolescence and without vascular risk factors. Referred from ophthalmology by biweekly episodes characterized by central teicopsia that progressively covers the entire visual field in 20 minutes, without being influenced by opening or closing eyes, which disappears after 40 minutes from the beginning. The episodes are not stereotyped, they are not followed by headache, nor do they associate other neurological symptoms. Neurological examination and complementary tests were normal. It is concluded in favor of typical aura without headache and after six months of starting treatment with Lamotrigine there were no recurrences. Final conclusion: The diagnosis of typical aura without headache begins with an adequate anamnesis. Due to the nature of its manifestations it is necessary to differentiate it from other etiologies such as transient ischemic attacks and focal seizures due to the diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications. It may appear, as in this case, in patients with migraine without aura. Lamotrigine is an excellent therapeutic option in the typical aura without headache.",

      "title": "Stressful headache already among young adults?",
      "abstract": "Stress is defined as an organism’s total response to environmental demands or pressures. The impact of stress on the body was explored by Hans Selye in 1936 (1). He first defined a ‘‘general adaptation syndrome,’’ which revolves around the concept of homeostasis. According to the concept of homeostasis, in response to stressors the body seeks to return to its equilibrium state, or a normal level of stress resistance. The general adaptation syndrome is composed of an initial alarm phase, followed by a period of sustained resistance, and ending with exhaustion. During the initial alarm phase, the body begins to build up resistance to the stressor beyond normal resistance levels and mobilizes the sympathetic nervous system to meet the immediate threat. In the resistance phase, the individual’s body attempts to resist or cope with a persistent stressor that cannot be avoided. This phase also results in an increase in level of hormones like cortisol, which has been found to be elevated during stressful situations (2). Finally, the body enters the exhaustion phase which can threaten the person’s well-being and lead to psychological or physical health consequences. The causes of stress are a mix of personal, interpersonal, and social factors and can include any event or occurrence that a person considers a threat to his or her coping strategies or resources. For example, lack or loss of control over one’s physical environment or social support network can cause stress. In addition, some vulnerability to stress could be caused by genetic markers (3). The symptoms of stress can be either physical or psychological. Stress-related physical illnesses, such as heart attacks, arthritis, and chronic pain conditions, result from long-term overstimulation of a part of the sympatric nervous system that regulates the heart rate, blood pressure, and digestive system (4). Moreover, chronic stress increases the risk of developing depression and anxiety (5). Stress and headache are intricately interrelated and there are several questions concerning the etiology of stress and headache. On one side, stress could act as a trigger for headache or migraine attacks and modify or exacerbate headache intensity and duration. This also includes the immediate time after reduction of stress (‘‘let-down headache’’) (6). Stress and stressful life events may also increase headache/migraine attack frequency, eventually resulting in chronic headache forms (7,8). On the other side, headache and migraine attacks themselves could act as factors leading to increased stress levels. In this issue of Cephalalgia, Schramm and colleagues evaluate the association between headache and stress in a longitudinal population-based study (9). The data are from a large general population-based study from Germany that includes a broad age range (21–71 years old). This longitudinal study quantitatively shows that the frequency of stressful events is positively and significantly correlated with the frequency of headaches. Furthermore, this association is particularly pronounced in participants with tension-type headache and among younger headache sufferers. The results of the study strongly underscore the importance of the stress-headache association on the population level and highlight that this association starts early in life. All analyses between perceived stress and the headache forms are adjusted for sex, age, frequent intake of acute pain medications, alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, and education. These data highlight the importance of evaluating young adults for the presence of this association and call for the development of interventions specifically tailored to this population. In their discussion, the authors suggest the use of mind/body treatments, such as meditation, yoga, or tai chi, and behavioral treatments such as stress management, coping skills, biofeedback, and relaxation training. However, there are little data regarding the effect of various interventions on the stress-headache",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric manifestations are common in Wilson's disease and mainly include extrapyramidal and cerebellar symptoms. Presentations with psychotic symptoms have been described less frequently. In this report we present the case of a young boy with Wilson's disease who developed psychotic symptoms. A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease on the basis of the physical examination findings and low ceruloplasmin levels (8.1 mg/dl). After 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute onset illness, characterized by delusion of persecution, fearfulness, hypervigilence and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with any confusion, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations and affective symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. One week after the onset of the symptoms he was prescribed tab penicillamine, initially 250 mg/day, which was increased to 500 mg/day after 3 days. After increase in the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to hospitalization. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder (F06.2) due to Wilson's disease was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started, and the dose of penicillamine was reduced with which symptoms resolved. Whenever a young adolescent develops psychosis, especially of delusional type, the possibility of Wilson's disease must be considered.",

      "title": "CONCERNING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH",
      "abstract": "The results of the investigation may be thus summarized: I. Concerning immediate data we find that among the 60 cases there were 33 primaparaS and 27 multiparas. There were eight cases associated with pregnancy and in 52 psychoses followed childbirth. The onset of psychosis during pregnancy was found to be gradual, characterized by instability, unrest, mild anxiety, depressive mood with swing to elation, usually accompanied by insomnia and sometimes by headaches. In the post-partum psychoses the onset was rather sudden. In the majority of cases it would begin with excitement, in others with depression. The usual onset was between the first and fourteenth day. It was quite characteristic that the onset was related to the time of the patient's return home from the hospital, which was usually the tenth or twelfth day post-partum. At any rate the psychosis manifested itself during sub-involution, a point which, as will be seen later, is of importance. In case the onset was later there were prodormal signs during sub-involution. In the beginning there was very often a somatic element present, the more pronounced the closer the onset was to delivery. II. Personality data can be tabulated as follows: See table in the PDF file In the manic-depressive group there is often a history of a previous attack and there are cases which show a manic state of affairs during each pregnancy or after each childbirth. In the majority of cases the total affectivity and impulse-life are harmoniously integrated. Manifested affect whether elation or irritability is evenly distributed, everything pleases or irritates the patient, there is no exclusive investment of affect, but rather pathological accentuation. In schizophrenia the situation is quite different. There is obvious discord in integration of affectivity and impulse. We often meet, for instance, an insecure impulse and differentiated affectivity which may result in deceptive outward manifestations; for example, shyness and seclusiveness often harbors a rather strongly differentiated impulse. Moreover affectivity is not flexible, often exclusively and unmovably invested, and dissociation is present. Our findings concerning pre-psychotic sexual life such as frigidity are confirmatory to the findings of Anderson. While frigidity may be present, it is not particularly prominent. The age of marriage of our patients was between the ages of 16-28. Intersexual conditions were present in both groups. Again it is differently expressed in the two groups. If we consider the sexual impulse as a certain form of energy originally released by a biochemical, hormonal principle and evoluting into a force of infinite organic and psychological complexity, we find that the psychological component plays a greater rôle in the manic-depressive cases than in schizophrenia. On the other hand, impulse is of greater significance in the schizophrenic. Male distribution of bodily hair which is associated often with genital hypoplasia and dysplasia are more conspicuous in schizophrenia. In the manic case a very interesting feature is the outline of hair of the fronto-parietal region which has the masculine convex form, and which is quite pronounced. Activity is often of masculine order, the voice may also have a male character in the manic. III. Mental content. The ideation in the manic state is the usual one. The patient usually betrays her aspirations and solves them in a grandiose manner, for instance, a patient who is very fond of children expresed the idea that she is going to have more children and immediately. In case of rejection of the husband the cause is very easy to trace and is referrable to social or biological inferiority of the husband; for example, a patient who had superior cravings and whose husband was inferior to her in both aspects, spoke in her psychosis of marrying the Prince of Wales. They may sometimes deny marriage, but there is no such absurd compensation as in the schizophrenic. No infanticide ideas were met in the manic state but such ideas are not infrequent in depression. We shall discuss this point presently; the depressive phase offers otherwise the usual syndrome. The ideation of the schizophrenic is differently expressed. We are interested for the present in the question of rejection of the marital situation. The denial of the latter may assume a bizarre form, and its expression is a matter of degree. From simple hostility it may progress to ideas of virginity and further to identification with the Holy Virgin. Ideas of infanticide are common. Here we can trace at least two ways of their construction. In certain schizophrenics and in the depressed phase our findings are confirmatory to those of Hopwood. We find the primary idea to be suicide, which overflows and may enclose husband and child. (We have discussed the possible mechanism of suicide in another study.) In cases of this type infanticide seems to be prompted by the affect of sorrow for the fate of the family. It is of interest that in the pre-psychotic personality of such patients we find sentimentality to be an outstanding trait. In other cases infanticide must be regarded as a projective expression, and belongs primarily to the domain of impulse. The projection is also a matter of degree. It may involve child, husband and may progress to ideas of world destruction. In certain cases of catatonia when the extreme excitement or stupor subsides the patient may have no recollection of her previous ideation (such amnesia being often unjustifiably doubted). This seems to go with White's interpretation of catatonia on psychological lines when he states that the catatonic endeavors to shut out from consciousness his conflict by a supreme effort of repression. Biologically we like to interpret this as a vigorous effort on the part of the auto-regulation of functions (\"biological conscience,\" von Monakov) to restore balance. IV. Pathological data. In conjunction with our other work we have reason to believe that certain autopsy findings are of considerable importance for our problem. We wish to call attention to the damage to the reticulo-endothel which is quite pronounced and to ovarian changes. The latter have shown considerable damage. The changes suggested circulatory disturbance which obviously must impair nutrition and consequently secretion, with luteinization and conspicuous reduction of graafian follicules. We shall discuss these findings in conjunction with otherwise well established physiological changes which occur during pregnancy.",

The pattern was of mild but typical depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms were more common in subjects with more severe initial illness, but were not related to any other predictors, including longer prior illness, dysthymia, or lower dose of drug treatment during the illness episode. There were weak associations with personality that might have been consequences of symptom presence. Residual symptoms were very strong predictors of subsequent early relapse, which occurred in 76% (13/17) of those with residual symptoms and 25% (10/40) of those without.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction in Uremia",
      "abstract": "Disturbances in sexual function are a common feature of chronic renal failure. Approximately 50% of uremic men complain of erectile dysfunction while an even greater percentage of both men and women complain of decreased libido and a marked decline in the frequency of intercourse (1,2). The genesis of sexual dysfunction is multifactorial and is primarily organic in origin. In addition to the uremic milieu, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, and pharmacologic therapy all play an important role in the genesis of this problem. In addition, psychologic and physical stresses are also commonly present in this setting. Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men In men with chronic renal failure, disturbances in the pituitary-gonadal axis can be detected with only moderate reductions in the GFR and progressively worsen as the renal failure progresses. These disorders rarely normalize with initiation of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and, in fact, often progress. By comparison, a well-functioning renal transplant is much more likely to restore normal sexual activity, although some features of reproductive function may remain impaired (3). Testicular Function Chronic renal failure is associated with impaired spermatogenesis and testicular damage, often leading to infertility (4). Semen analysis typically shows a decreased volume of ejaculate, either low or complete azoospermia, and a low percentage of motility. These abnormalities are often apparent before the need for dialysis and then deteriorate further once dialytic therapy is initiated. Histologic changes in the testes include evidence of decreased spermatogenic activity with the greatest changes in the hormonally dependent later stages of spermatogenesis. The number of spermatocytes is reduced and there is little evidence of maturation to the stage of mature sperm. In most instances, the number of spermatogonia is normal but on occasion complete aplasia of germinal elements may also be present. Other findings include damage to the seminiferous tubules, interstitial fibrosis, and calcifications. Unlike other causes of severe primary testicular lesions, the Leydig and Sertoli cells show little evidence of hypertrophy or hyperplasia. This later finding suggests a defect in the hormonal regulation of the Leydig and Sertoli cells as might occur with either gonadotropin deficiency or resistance, rather than a cytotoxic effect of uremia where spermatogonia would be most affected (5). The factors responsible for testicular damage in uremia are not well understood. It is possible that plasticizers in dialysis tubing, such as phthalate, may play a role in propagating the abnormalities once patients begin maintenance hemodialysis. Sex Steroids In addition to impaired spermatogenesis, the testes also show evidence of impaired endocrine function. Total and free testosterone levels are typically reduced, although the binding capacity and concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin are normal (6,7,8). Acute stimulation of testosterone secretion with administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a compound with luteinizing hormone-like actions, produces only a blunted response in uremic men (9). Lower free testosterone levels and impaired Leydig cell sensitivity to HCG are first detectable with only moderate reductions in the GFR and before basal levels of testosterone fall. Recent studies have shown evidence of a factor in uremic serum capable of blocking the luteinizing hormone receptor, thus providing an explanation for the sluggish response of the Leydig cell to infusion of HCG (10). This blocking activity is inversely correlated with GFR and largely disappears after transplantation. Compared with testosterone, the total plasma estrogen concentration is often elevated in advanced renal failure (8). However, the physiologically important estradiol levels are typically in the normal range. As with the lack of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of Leydig cells, normal levels of estradiol suggest a functional gonadotropin deficiency or resistance in uremia because increased luteinizing hormone levels should enhance the testicular secretion of estradiol (5). Hypothalamic-Pituitary Function The plasma concentration of the pituitary gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone (LH), is elevated in uremic men (8). Elevated levels are found early in renal insufficiency and progressively rise with deteriorating renal function. The excess LH secretion in this setting is thought to result from the diminished release of testosterone from the Leydig cells, since testosterone normally leads to feedback inhibition of LH release. In addition, the metabolic clearance rate of LH is reduced as a result of decreased renal clearance. The increase in serum LH is variable and modest when compared to that observed in castrate nonuremic subjects. The lack of a more robust response of LH to low levels of circulating testosterone suggests a derangement in the central regulation of gonadotropin release. Infusion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) increases LH levels to the same degree as in healthy subjects; however, the peak value and return to baseline may be delayed (11,12). Since the kidney contributes importantly to the clearance of GnRH and LH, decreased metabolism of these hormones may explain the observed variations. The abnormal LH response to GnRH precedes and is not corrected by dialytic therapy. By contrast, renal transplantation returns the response of gonadotropins back to normal. In addition to decreased metabolism, subtle disturbances in LH secretion have also been described. Under normal circumstances, LH is secreted in a pulsatile manner. In uremic subjects, the number of secretory bursts remains normal but the amount of LH released per secretory burst is reduced (13). It is not known whether this decrease in amplitude is the result of a change in the pattern of GnRH release from the hypothalamus or a change in the responsiveness of the pituitary. In either case, the secretory pattern of LH returns to normal with the placement of a well-functioning allograft. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is also increased in men with chronic renal failure, although to a more variable degree such that the LH/FSH ratio is typically increased. FSH release by the pituitary normally responds to feedback inhibition by a peptide product of the Sertoli cells called inhibin. The plasma FSH concentration tends to be highest in those uremic patients with the most severe damage to seminiferous tubules and presumably the lowest levels of inhibin. It has been suggested that increased FSH levels may portend a poor prognosis for recovery of spermatogenic function after renal transplantation (4,14). Clomiphene is a compound that acts by competing with estrogen or testosterone for receptors at the level of the hypothalamus and prevents the negative feedback of gonadal steroids on the release of GnRH and subsequently the release of pituitary gonadotropins. When administered to chronic renal failure patients, there is an appropriate rise in the levels of both LH and FSH, suggesting that the negative feedback control of testosterone on the hypothalamus is intact and that the storage and release of gonadotropins by the pituitary is normal (8). In summary, a number of observations suggest that gonadal failure is an important consequence of chronic renal failure. The finding that LH levels are typically increased is consistent with the presence of testicular damage. However, the lack of Leydig cell hypertrophy and normal estradiol levels also raise the possibility of functional hypogonadism. The finding that LH levels are only modestly increased in chronic renal failure suggests a diminished response of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to lowered testosterone levels and impaired regulation of gonadotropin secretion. One explanation for the blunted rise in LH in response to low levels of testosterone is that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in chronic renal failure is reset in such a way that it is more sensitive to the negative feedback inhibition of testosterone. In this manner, the axis begins to assume a similar characteristic as seen in the prepubertal state where there is extreme sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of gonadal steroids (5). Prolactin Metabolism Elevated plasma prolactin levels are commonly found in dialyzed men (15). Increased production is primarily responsible, since the kidney plays little, if any, role in the catabolism of this hormone. Prolactin release is normally under dopaminergic inhibitory control. Its secretion in chronic renal failure, however, appears autonomous and resistant to stimulatory or suppressive maneuvers. As an example, dopamine infusion or the administration of oral L-dopa fails to decrease basal prolactin levels. On the other hand, procedures that normally increase prolactin secretion such as arginine infusion, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, or thyrotropin-releasing hormone infusion elicit no response or only a blunted response. Again, these abnormalities resolve after a successful renal transplant. Increased prolactin secretion in chronic renal failure may be related in part to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. An infusion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in healthy men enhances prolactin release, a response that can be suppressed by the administration of L-dopa (16). Furthermore, partial inhibition of PTH release by the administration of calcitriol led in one study to an elevation in plasma testosterone levels, a reduction in plasma gonadotropin concentrations, and improved sexual function (17). However, this benefit could not be confirmed in a controlled trial of calcitriol therapy (18). Depletion of total body zinc stores may also play an etiologic role in uremic hyperprolactinemia (19). The clinical significance of enhanced prolactin release in uremic men is incompletely understood. Extreme hyperprolactinemia is associated with infertility, loss of libido, low circulating testosterone levels, and inappropriately low LH levels in men with normal renal function. These observations led to the evaluation of therapy with bromocryptine, which reduces prolactin secretion. Although it can lower prolactin levels to near normal in men with advanced renal disease, there has been an inconsistent effect on sexual potency and libido (15). In addition, a high incidence of side effects may be seen, particularly hypotension. Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occurs in approximately 30% of men on maintenance hemodialysis. This problem most often develops during the initial months of dialysis and then tends to regress as dialysis continues. The pathogenesis of gynecomastia in this setting is unclear. Although elevated prolactin levels and an increased estrogen-to-androgen ratio seem attractive possibilities, most data fail to support a primary role for abnormal hormonal function. Alternatively, a mechanism similar to that responsible for gynecomastia following refeeding of malnourished patients may be involved. Evaluation of Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men Sexual dysfunction can be manifest in several ways in uremic men. Perhaps the most common complaint the physician must address is that of impotence (Table 1). In evaluating and ultimately treating the impotent renal failure patient, one must not only consider disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis discussed above, but also abnormalities in the sympathetic nervous system and derangements in the arterial supply or venous drainage of the penis. In addition, the psychologic effects of a chronic illness and lifestyle limitations may have a negative impact on sexual function.Table 1: Factors involved in the pathogenesis of impotence in uremic menaA through history and physical can provide useful information during the initial evaluation of a patient with impotence. A history of normal erectile function before the development of renal failure suggests a secondary cause of impotence. Symptoms or physical findings of a neuropathy as in a patient with a neurogenic bladder would indicate a neurologic etiology. Similarly, symptoms or signs of peripheral vascular disease may be a clue to the presence of vascular obstruction to penile blood flow. One should look for the presence of secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial, axillary, and pubic hair. The lack of these findings and the presence of small soft testicles suggest primary or secondary hypogonadism as the cause of the impotence. Neurogenic and vascular causes are more likely to be associated with normalsized testicles. Even when the history and physical point to a specific abnormality, one must also consider that an individual patient may have more than one factor responsible for the erectile dysfunction and other causes may need to be ultimately evaluated. A review of the patient's medications may reveal a drug that could be responsible for impairing sexual function. Antihypertensive medications are common offenders, with centrally acting agents and beta blockers being the most commonly implicated agents in causing impotence. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are associated with a lower incidence of impotence and represent a useful alternative in renal failure patients with hypertension. Other drugs commonly implicated include cimetidine, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and metoclopramide. If the history and physical examination reveal no obvious cause, then a psychologic cause of erectile dysfunction may need to be considered. Testing for the presence of nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) has been done in some centers as a means to discriminate between a psychologic and organic cause of impotence. The basis for this test is that during the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, males normally have an erection. The assumption is that a man with a psychologic cause of impotence would still experience erections while asleep, whereas the absence of an adequate erection would make an organic cause more likely. If a patient is found to have nocturnal erections, then psychologic testing and evaluation is indicated. It should be noted that NPT testing is not infallible and that if a patient has a normal test and no psychologic cause is found then evaluation for an organic cause should still be pursued. Primary depression may affect sexual function and lead to reduced libido and decreased frequency of intercourse. As a result, it has been suggested that depression may play a role in the genesis of sexual dysfunction in chronic renal failure patients. Studies addressing this issue have produced conflicting results. Procci et al. found no association between the presence or absence of depression and measures of sexual function such as frequency of intercourse or ability to develop an erection as determined by NPT testing (1). In a more recent study, Steele et al. surveyed a randomly selected group of 68 peritoneal dialysis patients that included both men and women and found that 63% of patients reported never having intercourse, 19% had intercourse less than or equal to two times per month, and 18% had intercourse more than two times per month (20). In this study, standard psychologic questionnaires indicated that the patients who never had intercourse were more depressed and anxious, and assessed their overall quality of life at a level that was significantly lower than that of the other two groups. Thus, subclinical depression may be underrated as a contributory cause of sexual dysfunction in both uremic men and women. It is also likely that mental symptoms of fatigue and listlessness associated with the treatment of end-stage renal disease are also major factors in this problem (2). There are tests that may aid in the discrimination between a neurogenic and a vascular cause of impotence. Tests performed to exclude a vascular etiology of impotence include Doppler studies to measure penile blood flow, measurement of penile BP, and penile pulse palpation. Neurogenic impotence is suggested by detecting a prolonged latency time of the bulbocavernous reflex or confirming the presence of a neurogenic bladder. With the availability of sildenafil (see below) to use in a therapeutic trial, such tests are generally reserved for nonresponders who may eventually be considered for surgical placement of a penile prosthesis. As discussed previously, hormonal abnormalities are frequently detected in chronic renal failure patients. Endocrine tests that are useful in the evaluation of an organic cause of impotence include measurement of serum LH, FSH, testosterone, and prolactin levels. It should be noted that only a small percentage of uremic patients will have prolactin levels >100 ng/ml. Imaging studies of the hypothalamic-pituitary region should be performed in patients with levels of greater magnitude to exclude the presence of a microadenoma or macroadenoma. Treatment of Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men The treatment of sexual dysfunction in uremic men is initially of a general nature (Figure 1). One needs to ensure optimal delivery of dialysis and adequate nutritional intake. Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin has been shown to enhance sexual function in chronic renal failure. It is likely that the associated improvement in well-being that comes with the correction of anemia probably plays an important role in this response. In some studies, erythropoietin therapy has been reported to cause normalization of the pituitary gonadal feedback mechanism with reduced plasma concentrations of LH and FSH and increases in plasma testosterone levels (21,22). Reductions in elevated plasma prolactin levels have also been noted (23). It is controversial as to whether these endocrinologic changes are solely the result of correction of the anemia or a direct effect of erythropoietin. As mentioned previously, controlling the degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism with 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D may be of benefit in lowering prolactin levels and improving sexual function in some patients.Figure 1.: Approach to sexual dysfunction in uremic men.Patients with normal NPT testing should be evaluated to determine whether there is a psychologic component to the impotence. If a problem is found then a trial of psychotherapy is warranted. The effectiveness of antidepressant medications and/or psychiatric counseling in chronic renal failure patients with sexual dysfunction has not been well studied. In patients with a neurogenic or vascular cause of impotence, therapeutic options include intracavernous injection of alprostadil (synthetic PGE1), use of vacuum/constriction devices, or urethral suppositories containing alprostadil. Surgical placement of a penile prosthesis is typically considered in patients who fail the less invasive first-line treatments. With the recent approval of sildenafil for the treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, many physicians now utilize this agent as the first-line therapy for patients with psychogenic, vascular, or neurogenic causes of impotence. There have been no published studies to date specifically addressing the effectiveness and safety of sildenafil in chronic renal failure patients. However, anecdotally the drug appears effective in such patients. Since the majority of patients receiving renal replacement therapy in the United States are diabetic, it is noteworthy that a recently published randomized controlled trial found that sildenafil was both effective and well tolerated in diabetic men with erectile dysfunction (24). More than 95% of the patients in this study were believed to have either a neurogenic or vascular etiology of erectile dysfunction. Whether diabetic patients with renal disease will experience a similar benefit is not known. It should be emphasized that sildinafil is contraindicated in patients who are currently taking organic nitrates. Caution should also be exercised when prescribing this agent to patients with known coronary artery disease. In patients with low circulating levels of testosterone, correcting the deficit generally results in clinical improvement in other forms of gonadal failure. By contrast, administration of testosterone to uremic men usually fails to restore libido or potency, despite increased testosterone levels and reduced release of LH and FSH (25,26). In a recent report of 27 male dialysis patients with biochemically proven hypogonadism, administration of depot testosterone fully restored sexual function in only three patients (27). In those patients unresponsive to medical therapy, use of a vacuum tumescence device completely corrected penile erection dysfunction in the majority of cases. In a hypogonadal patient whose primary complaint is decreased libido, a trial of testosterone may be warranted. In very limited studies, administration of clomiphene citrate has also been reported to cause a normalization of plasma testosterone levels associated with some improvement in sexual function. Patients found to have increased circulating levels of prolactin may benefit from a trial of bromocryptine. This agent is a dopaminergic agonist that has shown some efficacy in improving sexual function presumably by reducing elevated prolactin levels. However, its usefulness has been limited by a relatively high frequency of side effects. Other dopaminergic agonists, such as parlodel and lisuride, seem to be better tolerated but have only been used in small short-term studies. Zinc deficiency has also been suggested as a cause of gonadal failure. Uremic patients are often deficient in zinc, probably due to reduced dietary intake, zinc malabsorption, and/or possible leaching of zinc by dialysis equipment. In a controlled trial, supplemental zinc resulted in significant increases in the plasma testosterone concentration and sperm counts, as well as significant declines in LH and FSH levels compared with a control group (28). Potency, libido, and frequency of inter-course also improved in those patients given zinc. It is possible that normalization of total body zinc may also be effective in correcting uremic hyperprolactinemia (19). Thus, the aggregate data suggest that the administration of zinc in a zinc-deficient man is a reasonable therapeutic option. Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Women Disturbances in menstruation and fertility are commonly encountered in women with chronic renal failure, usually leading to amenorrhea by the time the patient reaches end-stage renal disease. The menstrual cycle typically remains irregular with scanty flow after the initiation of maintenance dialysis, although normal menses is restored in some women (29). In others, hypermenorrhagia develops, potentially leading to significant blood loss and increased transfusion requirements. The major menstrual abnormality in uremic women is anovulation, with affected patients being infertile (30). Women on chronic dialysis also tend to complain of decreased libido and reduced ability to reach orgasm (2,20). Pregnancy can rarely occur in advanced renal failure, but fetal wastage is markedly increased. Some residual renal function is usually present in the infrequent pregnancy that can be carried to term. The subject of pregnancy in chronic renal insufficiency has recently been reviewed (31). Normal Menstrual Cycle The normal menstrual cycle is divided into a follicular or proliferative phase and a luteal or secretory phase. Normal follicular maturation and subsequent ovulation require appropriately timed secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins. FSH secretion exhibits typical negative feedback, with hormone levels falling as the plasma estrogen concentration rises. In contrast, LH secretion is suppressed maximally by low concentrations of estrogen but exhibits positive feedback control in response to a rising and sustained elevation of estradiol. Thus, high levels of estradiol in the late follicular phase trigger a surging elevation in LH secretion, which is responsible for ovulation. After ovulation, progesterone levels increase due to production by the corpus luteum. Progesterone is responsible for the transformation of the endometrium into the luteal phase. Hormonal Disturbances in Uremic Premenopausal Women Indirect determination of ovulation suggests that anovulatory cycles are the rule in uremic women (32). For example, endometrial biopsies show an absence of progestational effects, and there is a failure to increase basal body temperature at the time when ovulation would be expected. In addition, the preovulatory peak in LH and estradiol concentrations is frequently absent. The failure of LH to rise in part reflects a disturbance in the positive estradiol feedback pathway, since the administration of exogenous estrogen to mimic the preovulatory surge in estradiol fails to stimulate LH release (32). In contrast, feedback inhibition of gonadotropin release by low doses of estradiol remains intact. This can be illustrated by the ability of the antiestrogen clomiphene to enhance LH and FSH secretion. It remains unclear whether the disturbances in cyclic gonadotropin production originate in the hypothalamus (via impaired production of GnRH) or in the anterior pituitary (30). It is possible, for example, that endorphins are involved. Circulating endorphin levels are increased in chronic renal failure due primarily to reduced renal opioid clearance, and endorphins can inhibit ovulation, perhaps by reducing the release of GnRH. Prolactin and Galactorrhea Women with chronic renal failure commonly have elevated circulating prolactin levels. As in men with chronic renal failure, the hypersecretion of prolactin in this setting appears to be autonomous, as it is resistant to maneuvers designed to stimulate or inhibit its release. It has been suggested that the elevated prolactin levels may impair hypothalamic-pituitary function and contribute to sexual dysfunction and galactorrhea in these patients. It is of interest in this regard that nonuremic women with prolactin-producing pituitary tumors commonly present with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and low circulating gonadotropin levels. However, uremic women treated with bromocryptine rarely resume normal menses and continue to complain of galactorrhea (if present), despite normalization of the plasma prolactin concentration (32). Thus, factors other than hyperprolactinemia must be important in this setting. Hormonal Disturbances in Uremic Postmenopausal Women Postmenopausal uremic women have gonadotropin levels as high as those seen in nonuremic women of similar age (32,33). This observation is consistent with the finding mentioned above in premenopausal women that negative feedback inhibition of estrogen on LH and FSH release is intact in uremia. However, the age at which menopause begins in chronic renal failure tends to be decreased when compared to healthy women. Treatment The high frequency of anovulation leads sequentially to lack of formation of the corpus luteum and failure of progesterone secretion. Because progesterone is responsible for transforming the endometrium into the luteal phase, lack of progesterone is associated with amenorrhea. For patients who desire to resume menses, administration of a progestational agent during the final days of the monthly cycle will usually be successful. On the other hand, ongoing menses can contribute significantly to the anemia of chronic renal disease, particularly in those patients with hypermenorrhagia. In this setting, administration of a progestational agent during the entire monthly cycle will terminate menstrual flow. Rarely, a patient may require hysterectomy for refractory uterine bleeding. It is not known whether the usual absence of menses in women with chronic renal failure predisposes to the development of endometrial hyperplasia and possible carcinoma. Since these patients are often anovulatory, there is no disruption of the proliferative effect of estrogen by the release of progesterone. It is therefore recommended that women with chronic renal failure be monitored closely by a gynecologist; it may be desirable in at least some patients to administer a progestational agent several times per year to interrupt the proliferation induced by unopposed estrogen release (Figure 2).Figure 2.: Approach to sexual dysfunction in uremic women.Although pregnancy can rarely occur in women on chronic dialysis, restoration of fertility as a therapeutic goal should be discouraged. In comparison, the abnormalities in ovulation can usually be reversed and successful pregnancy achieved in women with a well-functioning renal transplant. Uremic women who are menstruating normally should be encouraged to use birth control. Studies addressing the therapy of decreased libido and sexual function in uremic women are lacking. Amenorrheic hemodialysis patients may have low estradiol levels that can secondarily lead to vaginal atrophy and dryness and result in discomfort during intercourse. Such patients may benefit from local estrogen therapy or vaginal lubricants. Low dose testosterone may be effective in increasing sexual desire but is rarely used secondary to potential toxicity. Bromocryptine therapy in hyperprolactinemic patients may help in restoring sexual function but has not been well studied. Estrogen supplementation may improve sexual function in those patients with low circulating estradiol levels. Successful transplantation is clearly the most effective means to restore normal sexual desire in women with chronic renal failure (2). Summary In summary, sexual dysfunction is a common finding in both men and women with chronic renal failure. Common disturbances include erectile dysfunction in men, menstrual abnormalities in women, and decreased libido and fertility in both sexes. These abnormalities are primarily organic in nature and are related to uremia as well as the other comorbid conditions that frequently accompany the chronic renal failure patient. Fatigue and psychosocial factors related to the presence of a chronic disease are also contributory factors. Disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can be detected before the need for dialysis but continue to worsen once dialytic therapy is initiated. Impaired gonadal function is prominent in uremic men, whereas the disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are more subtle. By contrast, central disturbances are more prominent in uremic women. Therapy is initially directed toward optimizing the delivery of dialysis, correcting anemia with recombinant erythropoietin, and controlling the degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism with vitamin D. For many practicing nephrologists, sildenafil has become the first-line therapy in the treatment of impotence. In the hypogonadal man whose only complaint is decreased libido, testosterone may be of benefit. Regular gynecologic follow-up is required in uremic women to guard against potential complications of unopposed estrogen effect. Uremic women should be advised against pregnancy while on dialysis. Successful transplantation is the most effective means of restoring normal sexual function in both men and women with chronic renal failure.",

      "title": "Estudio de la eficacia de un tratamiento psicológico breve en la disminución de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno de panico se define como un trastorno en el que los ataques de panico presentan de forma inesperada y recurrente y al menos uno de ellos va seguido de un minimo de un mes de inquietud o preocupacion persistente por la aparicion de nuevas crisis o sus consecuencias, y/o por un cambio significativo y desadaptativo en el comportamiento que se relaciona con los ataques de panico. El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

Most victims do not seek professional help nor do they report the abuse to the police, and most of the victims who do seek medical help do not mention the abuse. Doctors often do not recognize the signs of sexual abuse. Most victims of rape have symptoms that may develop into posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if they persist for more than 4 weeks, such as sleep problems or panic attacks. Victims of sexual abuse also more often develop a psychiatric disorder or medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Doctors should ask about sexual abuse in cases of MUS or unexplained mental problems. The complications of abuse can be treated with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) or cognitive processing therapy (CPT).",

      "abstract": "espanolEn la ultima decada estudios previos han demostrado un aumento de las cifras de prolactina en pacientes con un primer episodio psicotico libres de tratamiento respecto a controles sanos. Aunque no existen mecanismos fisiopatologicos claros, existe la posibilidad de que se trate de una alteracion secundaria al contexto estresante del debut psicotico. Alternativamente, los pacientes con un trastorno psicotico podrian sufrir una regulacion anomala de la secrecion de prolactina con un exceso de factores estimuladores o un defecto de los factores inhibitorios. En la presente revision narrativa se comentan diferentes posibles mecanismos fisiopatologicos implicados incluyendo el papel del estres y la regulacion de la secrecion de prolactina en la via tuberoinfundibular, que puede evaluarse clinicamente con pruebas funcionales endocrinologicas. Este conocimiento ofrece una oportunidad de investigar las causas de estas alteraciones y dilucidar los mecanismos implicados en la hiperprolactinemia en fases tempranas de psicosis. EnglishIn the last decade, previous studies have shown an increase in prolactin levels in drug-free patients with a first psychotic episode compared to healthy controls. Although pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood, there is the possibility that this finding is secondary to the stressful context of the psychotic onset. Alternatively, patients with a psychotic disorder may suffer from an abnormal regulation of prolactin secretion with an excess of stimulating factors or a defect in inhibitory factors. In the present narrative review different possible physiopathological mechanisms are discussed, including the role of stress and the regulation of prolactin secretion in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which can be evaluated clinically with endocrinological functional tests. This knowledge offers an opportunity to investigate the causes of these alterations and elucidate the mechanisms involved in the hyperprolactinemia at early phases of psychosis.",

      "title": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and highly comorbid illness characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry (Box 19- ). It is marked by a later onset than other anxiety disorders (Kessler et al. 2005) and is associated with fluctuations in symptom severity and impairment (e.g., Wittchen et al. 2000). It demonstrates both a low probability of recovery (32%–58%) and a high likelihood of recurrence (45%–52%) (Rodriguez et al. 2006) over a 2- to 12-year period. GAD is associated with significant disability and impairment comparable to pure major depressive disorder (Hoffman et al. 2008) and can be more debilitating than pure substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and personality disorders, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and comorbid conditions (Grant et al. 2005). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder 300.02 F41.1 Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months): Note: Only one item is required in children. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. Being easily fatigued. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. Irritability. Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder). Individuals with GAD attempt to enhance their sense of control or preparedness through anticipation of negative outcomes or worst-case scenarios. They scan their environment for potential danger and negatively interpret neutral or ambiguous stimuli as threatening (Mathews and MacLeod 1994). Because of their lack of present moment focus, these individuals tend to ignore information in their immediate surroundings that could potentially challenge their distorted views (Borkovec and Newman 1998), which triggers emotional distress. This emotional distress is associated with many somatic features, including restlessness, fatigue, irritability, concentration difficulties, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. Overall, GAD is a serious and costly mental illness with regard to degree of distress, disability and subsequent loss of work productivity, and quality of life (Newman 2000). Thus, targeted interventions are necessary to effectively address core symptoms and associated features. In this chapter we discuss several empirically established approaches to treatment for GAD, including conventional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and integrative psychotherapy.",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

Mais la semiologie critique des autres mouvements buccaux est souvent plus difficile a decrire et a interpreter. Nous rapportons le cas d'une patiente de 38 ans, gauchere, dont les crises se manifestent essentiellement par des mouvements buccaux difficiles a caracteriser (ni un mâchonnement, ni un pourlechage, ni un phenomene moteur elementaire) qui evoquent des dyskinesies bucco-faciales. Elle a presente une meningite a l'âge de 7 mois, des crises d'allure generalisee a 9 ans, puis des crises partielles pluri-quotidiennes depuis l'âge de 24 ans. Ces crises debutent par une sensation de blocage dans la gorge avec blocage du langage, suivie d'une crispation des paupieres, inconstamment des membres superieurs et de mouvements buccaux. L'examen neurologique et les electro-encephalogrammes inter-critiques sont normaux. Les EEG critiques montrent une decharge rapide initiale fronto-centrale gauche. Une origine insulo-operculaire ou proche de l'aire motrice supplementaire a ete evoquee, d'autant que l'imagerie par resonance magnetique encephalique revele un hypersignal dans cette region a gauche.

La stimulation electrique de l'insula anterieure provoque une sensation de gorge serree alors que celle de la region lesionnelle declenche une crise electro-clinique. Les mouvements buccaux complexes de notre patiente apparaissent quand il existe une mise en jeu bipolaire, impliquant simultanement l'AMS et l'opercule precentral.

      "abstract": "To report our experience and investigate 5 original hypotheses: (1) multiple types of epileptic seizures occur in alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), and these can be the initial presentation; (2) epileptiform abnormalities often appear well after clinical seizures; (3) nonepileptic reduced awareness spells (RAS) occur frequently; (4) epilepsy is commonly drug resistant but may respond to vagal nerve stimulation (VNS); and (5) status epilepticus (SE) is common and is usually refractory and recurrent.We analyzed a cohort of 51 consecutive patients with AHC.Thirty-two of 51 patients had epilepsy: 18 focal seizures, frontal more frequently than temporal, and then posterior. Eleven had primary generalized seizures (tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and/or absence). Epileptic seizures preceded other AHC paroxysmal events in 8 (lag 5.63 ± 6.55 months; p = 0.0365). In 7 of 32, initial EEGs were normal, with the first epileptiform EEG lagging behind by 3.53 ± 4.65 years (p = 0.0484). RAS occurred equally in patients with epilepsy (16 of 32) and patients without epilepsy (10 of 19, p = 1.0). Twenty-eight patients had video-EEG; captured RAS showed no concomitant EEG changes. Nineteen patients (59%) were drug resistant. VNS resulted in >50% reduction in seizures in 5 of 6 (p < 0.04). Twelve patients (38%) had SE (9 of 12 multiple episodes), refractory/superrefractory in all (p < 0.001), and 4 of 12 had regression after SE.Epilepsy in AHC can be focal or generalized. Epileptic seizures may be the first paroxysmal symptom. EEG may become epileptiform only on follow-up. Epilepsy, although frequently drug resistant, can respond to VNS. RAS are frequent and nonepileptic. SE often recurs and is usually refractory/superrefractory. Our observations are consistent with current data on AHC-ATP1A3 pathophysiology.",

Hope exists that early detection and early intervention will enable us to prevent, delay or alleviate psychosis onset (McGorry et al., 1996).

      "abstract": "Etwa 5 bis 10% der erwachsenen Bevölkerung geben an, sich ziemlich häufig bis sehr häufig einsam zu fühlen. Darüber hinaus ist Einsamkeit ein Phänomen, welches im klinischen Alltag häufig anzutreffen ist, auch wenn es von Patientinnen und Patienten nicht immer spontan berichtet wird. Das aversive Gefühl der Einsamkeit tritt auf, wenn unser menschliches Grundbedürfnis nach sozialen Beziehungen nicht genügend befriedigt ist. Es zeigt sich bei Betroffenen, die über zu wenige oder qualitativ nicht ausreichend befriedigende Kontakte verfügen. Es ist wichtig, zwischen vorübergehender, situativer und überdauernder Einsamkeit zu unterscheiden. Denn obwohl jede Art von Einsamkeit schmerzhaft ist, ist Einsamkeit nicht immer dysfunktional. Während vorübergehenden und situativ bedingten Einsamkeitsgefühlen in der Regel eine adaptive Funktion zugeschrieben wird, sind überdauernde Einsamkeitsgefühle mit einem hohen Leidensdruck und einer Vielzahl von psychischen und somatischen Beschwerden assoziiert. Überdauernde Einsamkeitsgefühle spielen bei der Entstehung und/oder Aufrechterhaltung verschiedener psychischer Störungen eine zentrale Rolle. Der Band sensibilisiert Fachpersonen für das Thema Einsamkeit, fasst den aktuellen Stand zur Phänomenologie und Verbreitung von Einsamkeit zusammen und nennt verschiedene Risikofaktoren für die Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung von Einsamkeit. Zudem werden empirische Zusammenhänge von Einsamkeit mit psychischen und somatischen Störungen sowie klinischen Phänomenen wie Suizidalität berichtet. Der Band stellt verschiedene Erklärungsmodelle vor und beschreibt spezifische, darauf aufbauende Interventionsmöglichkeiten. Diese sollen Fachpersonen beim Umgang mit dem Thema Einsamkeit in der Therapie unterstützen und eine auf die individuellen Umstände einer Person abgestimmte Therapie ermöglichen.",

Isolated VVS cannot be regarded as a disease for several reasons: spontaneous syncope occurs in about half of individuals during their lives, and the unidentified neural pathways involved in the vasovagal response are probably present in all healthy humans, with individual differences in susceptibility; VVS is induced during tilt testing in several subjects with no history of syncope; during haemorrhagic shock, the vasovagal reaction can be observed in subjects with no history of syncope; about 20% of astronauts, who are selected on the basis of their great resistance to orthostatic stress, experience syncope or presyncope on landing after a short-duration space flight; to date, no genetic basis of VVS has been demonstrated; subjects with VVS are generally normotensive and, importantly, have normal blood pressure regulation apart from the episodes of syncope; hormonal disorders or a generalized state of autonomic involvement, although frequently investigated, have never been clearly demonstrated. Isolated VVS should be distinguished from those forms that start in old age and which are often associated with cardiovascular or neurological disorders, and other dysautonomic disturbances such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity, post-prandial hypotension, and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. In these subjects, VVS appears as an expression of a pathological process, i.e. a disease, mainly related to a generalized involvement of the autonomic nervous system, which is not yet well-defined from a nosological point of view.",

This is an attitude that they unfortunately share with most nonalcoholics; therefore some tact is required in referring them for treatment. If the alcoholic demonstrates abnormal behavior, appears depressed, or evidences a disturbance in his thinking (most frequently, ill-founded or illogical suspicions or grandiose opinions), he should certainly be examined psychiatrically, since in such cases the drinking may only be symptomatic of a severe underlying mental disturbance.

      "title": "Erectile dysfunction, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia are more common among acquired premature ejaculation patients in contrast to other premature ejaculation syndromes",
      "abstract": "Time (of the intravaginal ejaculatory latency, or IELT); control (of the ejaculation); distress (perceived by the patient and the partner): These are the dimensions well recognized as being intrinsically connected, and affected, in premature ejaculation (PE) patients.1 However, it is unanimously accepted that PE is a tri- or multidimensional disorder (considering the impairment of the orgasm2), meaning that other relevant psychosexological correlates characterize the condition and contribute to its pathophysiology and clinical presentation. This finding significantly emerges also from the recent and interesting paper \"erectile dysfunction, anxiety, perceived stress and Insomnia are more common among acquired premature ejaculation patients compared to other premature ejaculation syndromes\" by Demirci et al. In particular, erectile dysfunction (ED) severity was found to be high in patients with acquired PE (APE) (80.0%) and moderate in lifelong PE (LPE) (38.5%), while the greatest number of patients with no ED were found in the type subgroup previously (although not consistently) defined in the past as \"subjective\" PE (SPE in the article, a now misleading acronym, being used for the well-structured taxonomic category of subclinical premature ejaculation, having major and minor diagnostic criteria: SPE3) (75.0%). However, looking at the other side of the coin, 11 of 18 of such SPE patients (thus more than 50%) were found to have moderate or severe ED too. If, on the one hand, it is bizarre to notice that such patients who thought they have ejaculated early despite a normal time (hence labelled as subjective PE) and, for this reason, in contrast to \"true\" PE patients (i.e., LPE and APE) end up having ED too, on the other hand (and looking from a more realistic perspective) such data are not surprising at all. Indeed, in clinical practice, 50% of patients with PE also report ED, and the correlation between erectile and ejaculatory function is so well-known that recently a new taxonomic entity called \"loss of control of erection and ejaculation\" has been proposed,3 to identify the condition of impaired ability to control at the same time erectile and ejaculatory function which so frequently occurs among patients,4 and so frequently it is neither diagnosed nor treated. In fact, the decision not to treat a patient that complains about PE because he thinks to have ejaculated early despite a normal time, can forecast potential risks in clinical management. Indeed, often such patients, despite showing a subnormal IELT, may still face a relevant lack of control in the ejaculation process (and significant perceived distress). ED can often be superimposed on these patients, who instinctively reduce their level of excitement in an attempt to control their ejaculation. Thereby, considering them as having a subjective disorder, simply reassuring rather than treating them, may worsen the situation, harbouring, bona fide, the risk of converting a situation of subclinical PE into an overt PE. Among the patients analyzed by Demirci et al., only four of 18 of subjective PE reported good or very good ejaculatory control. Moreover, the median value of their premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT), is 11, which yet accounts for a PE diagnosis. Indeed, PEDT, the most important psychometric test aiding the diagnosis of PE, has precisely two items dealing with control, two for distress, and one only for time. Interestingly, the Patient Reported Outcomes of this diagnostic tool are now validated for the autoerotic setting, enlarging the diagnostic possibilities of PE diagnosis to single people.5 More emphasis is given to the lack of control and distress, rather than the IELT, for defining what PE is. This has been similarly stated by the latest guidelines of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine, which recommended considering the aspects of the tri-dimensional definition of PE in order of clinical importance.6 Hierarchically, loss of control over ejaculation is clinically more relevant than the distress provoked in the patient or the partner, and even more than short IELT.7 We found another interesting finding in the Demirci et al.'s article. The Colleagues nicely found, by well-validated psychometric tools, that PE symptoms are associated with worse sleep quality and erectile function. Future research should concentrate on the levels of testosterone, robustly related to nocturnal apneas and ED, also in PE, which presents significantly higher levels of T with respect to other sexual dysfunctions such as ED.8 Altogether, this article reminds us once more that time is only one of the main criteria for establishing a diagnosis of PE and that the clinical spectrum of PE is quite more complex. We thereby encourage, when dealing with PE patients both in the research and in the clinical practice, to consider the sexual and non-sexual comorbidities,9 as well all the lights and shades of the current definitions and to realistically appraise the whole clinical spectrum of PE patients, very far from being only a matter of (short) time.10",

Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history.

Los casos fueron divididos en 4 tipos été ataques: espasmos infantiles, estatus epilepticus, y “otros” generalizados o parciales (enfermos sin espasmos o status). Durante más été un ano se estudié la mortalidad en 334 casos y el pronéstico mental y neurologico en 313 ninos. El pronostico global fué muy pobre incluso en los casos sin espasmos infantiles. La mortalidad fue más alta y las secuelas neurológicas m^s comunes en los casos sintomaticos que en los criptogenicos. La más alta mortalidad y el mayor niimero été defectos neurolbgicos se encontraron en los status epilepticus y en el grupo été“otros” ataques parciales. Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

The obvious differences in disease courses between patients led to the classification of MS as either relapsing–remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS). The majority of patients starts with a relapsing–remitting disease course characterized by acute exacerbation followed by partial or total recovery; whereas PPMS is associated with a continuous worsening of symptoms and is only observed in about 10–15% of the patients. However, even the clinical presentation does not always allow clear separation between RRMS or PPMS, since some MS patients start with a progressive disease course after a single or few relapses or suffer from a progressive disease from the beginning superimposed by few relapses. The subsequent rate of disease progression is comparable in SPMS and PPMS and is not affected by relapses as soon as a certain Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score is reached. 1 Only about 50% of siblings with MS show an identical disease course. The recently identified susceptibility genes, each of which each contributes less than 1% of disease risk, are comparably distributed in RRMS and PPMS. 2 These epidemiological findings suggest that the different disease courses represent different ends of a disease spectrum rather than different diseases or disease etiologies. This point of view is supported by histopathological and imaging studies that describe quantitative rather than qualitative differences between different clinical courses. Although no fundamental differences have been identified between patients with either RRMS/SPMS or PPMS, this does not mean that the same pathomechansims are responsible for clinical symptoms in all MS patients. The histopathological hallmarks of MS change with disease duration. Whereas the development of new focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions in grey and white matter dominate the pathology at the beginning of the disease, the progressive disease phase is characterized by diffuse white matter abnormalities, accumulation of axonal loss in demyelinated as well as normal-appearing white matter and limited remyelination. The relapses are believed to be the consequences of focal inflammatory lesions whereas recovery may be induced by resolution of inflammation and edema, increased plasticity and endogenous repair mechanisms such as remyelination. RRMS patients develop numerous contrastenhancing lesions which presumably represent actively demyelinating lesions and the number of newly developing lesions decrease with disease duration. 3 This point of view is supported by histological studies which demonstrate a higher number of actively demyelinating lesions in RRMS than in SPMS. Patients with PPMS also develop contrastenhancing lesions and this is associated with a more rapid progression of disease. 4 Not surprisingly, actively demyelinating lesions can also be found in patients with PPMS. 3 These highly inflammatory lesions, observed in the early disease stages, are heterogeneous with respect to composition of inflammation and extent of initial oligodendroglial cell death, suggesting that different pathomechanisms may lead to demyelination. However, these different histological patterns described by Lucchinetti et al. are not predictive for the clinical disease course. 5 Due to the accumulation of new lesions, the extent of demyelination increases with disease duration: histopathological and imaging studies show that patients with PPMS tend to have comparable lesion loads to RRMS or SPMS patients but that the lesions",

      "title": "Chapter 7 EPILEPSY AND SEIZURES: EXCITOTOXICITY OR EXCITOTROPHICITY?",
      "abstract": "Excitotoxic neuronal death has been clearly documented in the adult brain following status epilepticus (SE), a state of uninterrupted seizure activity that may last for hours . The severity and duration of SE determine the extent of neuronal injury; in most animal models damage is observed with durations of one hour or longer. Severity , duration and rate of onset may also influence the extent to which the neuronal death is mediated by apoptotic or necrotic processes. In contrast to the adult brain, the immature brain is resistant to SE-induced damage ; nevertheless long-term deleter ious effects of SE have been observed in animals that experienced SE in infancy without exhibiting neuronal loss. Likewise , in adult animals , long-term abnormalities such as spontaneous seizur es have been documented follow ing SE even under conditions in which the brain was protected from damag e. This suggests that SE-induced excitotoxic injury is not required for the development of long-term disrupt ion of neuronal function in the aftermath of SE. In contrast to SE, recurrent intermittent brief seizures such as those typicall y associated with epilepsy, do not necessar ily cause neuronal inj ury. In patients with epilepsy it is often difficult to determine whether brain lesions are a cause or consequence of the seizure condition ; little or no injury has been observed with chronic brief seizures in several animal models . In fact, exposure to repeated brief non injurious seizures has been shown to exert a neuroprotective action, possibly as a consequence of induction of expression of neurotrophic factors . This e xcitotrophic effect of seizures extends beyond protect ion against SE-induced injury to include protection in models such as adrenalectomy-induced granule cell death . It is therefore possible that seizures may serve to protect against neurodegeneration and promote regrowth and remodeling in the face of insults to the nervous system. Thus , seizures can span a spectrum from trophic and adaptive to toxic and maladaptive, depending upon the conditions of their occurrence and the extent to which they are regulated. In this context, seizures may be analogous to fever: adaptive and protective in specific settings, with the capacity to become maladaptive and injurious in their own right if they develop into SE or a long lasting epileptic condition .",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background:</h3> Systemic manifestations are common in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and play a major role in the prognosis. Neurological complications may affect both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). The incidence varies from several to several dozen percent. The course of the disease and the severity of the symptoms may be mild and self-limiting or progressive, leading to permanent neurological deficits. It is worth remembering that the symptoms of nervous system involvement may precede the onset of symptoms of dryness, and diagnosis of pSS may be delayed after a certain duration of neurological symptoms. <h3>Objectives:</h3> The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of PNS involvement among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with the diagnosis of pSS in our University Clinical Centre. <h3>Methods:</h3> We studied a consecutive group of fifty unselected patients aged from 33 to 74 years (mean 55.8 years). All patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of pSS. Additional connective tissue diseases and diabetes were the exclusion criteria. Disease activity was evaluated according to the EULAR Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI). All patients underwent clinical neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) of nine peripheral nerves. For the classification of polyneuropathies the ESTEEM (European Standardized Telematic tool to Evaluate Electrodiagnostic Methods) guidelines were used. Clinical examination and nerve conduction study were performed and evaluated by one certified neurologist. <h3>Results:</h3> Of our 50 patients, 48 were female with a mean (±SD) age 53.6±10.5 years and mean disease duration 7.9±5.3 years. Two were male with mean age 43.7±25.8 years and mean disease duration 5.7±0.6 years. The mean age at diagnosis was 50.4±14 years. 23 (46%) patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of neuropathy. The most common PNS manifestation was sensorimotor neuropathy 11/23 (47%), mononeuropathy was present in 6/23 (26%) patients, pure axonal sensory neuropathy was present in 1/23 (4.3%) patient, axonal motor neuropathy in 1/23 (4.3%), SFN in 1/23 (4.3%) and cranial nerve involvement was present in 4/23 (17.4%) (one of the patients had both cranial and sensorimotor neuropathy). Neurological symptoms preceded the diagnosis of pSS in 8 (35%) of 23 PNS+ patients. The frequency of following symptoms and extraglandular manifestations was significantly higher in PNS+ compared to PNS- patients: salivary gland enlargement (74% vs 44% p&lt;0,05), respiratory tract involvement (65% vs 37% p&lt;0,05) and lymphadenopathy (61% vs 19% p&lt;0,05). The mean ESSDAI in patients with and without neurological involvement was 7±6,82 and 4,7±4,58 respectively (p=0.245). In this subgroup the use of cyclophosphamide, due to extraglandular manifestations, was increased (p&lt;0,05). <h3>Conclusion:</h3> We found that PNS involvement is a common extraglandular manifestation of pSS (46% in our group). Sensorimotor neuropathies were most frequent. Involvement of the PNS seems frequent but remains underestimated. NCS is a non-invasive test which might be useful at diagnosis and follow-up. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral neuropathies in patients with pSS are needed. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

      "abstract": "In the USA, severe psychiatric illness after childbirth strikes one woman for every 1000 births, or about 3500 women each year. An unrecorded number of new mothers experience lesser degrees of postpartum illness, and two distinct forms of severe illness can be distinguished. One form, called postpartum psychosis, is an agitated, very changeable condition, often characterized by confusion, hallucinations, delusions and sometimes episodes of violent behaviour. The other condition, major postpartum depression, begins two or three weeks after childbirth, and is characterized by confusion, depression of mood, and often with exhaustion, headache and digestive upset. Mixtures of the two severe disorders occur frequently. This volume contains a number of essays which support the position that postpartum disorders are primarily organic and are mainly disorders of hormonal deficit. They develop as the endocrine system falls back from the hyperactivity of pregnancy toward or beyond the levels of the prior non-pregnant state. Tremendous therapeutic opportunities exist or are imminent for both the organic and the psychological components of postpartum mental illness.",

      "abstract": "A CASE OF RECURRENT PSEUDO CYESIS C. KNIGHT ALDRICH, MD* Pseudocyesis (false pregnancy) is, in a way, the ultimate psychosomatic condition in that the interrelationship among psychological and somatic causes and psychological and somatic symptoms is welldefined and relatively uncontroversial. Pseudocyesis has been recognized since the time of Hippocrates. Its incidence has been reported [1] as one case per 250 pregnancies. The signs and symptoms of amenorrhea, abdominal and uterine enlargement, changes in breasts and cervix, fetal movements, and nausea, vomiting, and weight gain have led physicians through the centuries to misdiagnose pregnancy as often as once in three cases, even in recent years [1, 2]. Symptoms are often related with such complete conviction by the patient that the physician or obstetrician is led to omit examinations or tests he might otherwise perform. Earlier psychodynamic formulations considered pseudocyesis to be a manifestation of a hysterical conversion. Later formulations viewed the condition as an organ neurosis. A more recent view [3] implicates depression as a major determinant. Childhood deprivation, the need to avoid abandonment or loss of love object, and the fear of losing the capacity to bear a child (most cases occur in childless women of an average age of thirty-three) have been implicated as potential contributors to causation. Psychophysiological correlates have also been explored. Fried et al. report that \"the psychic factor ... is capable of affecting the pituitary, probably by way of the hypothalamus, causing the release of lactogenic hormones, the suppression of follicle stimulating hormone and consequent persistence of lutein function with the production of estrogen and progesterone\" [pp. 1332-1333]. Brown and Barglow [3] postulate that depression is associated with alterations in the neuronal networks connecting the higher brain centers with the median eminence of the hypothalamus. This is as- * Professor of psychiatry, New Jersey School of Medicine, 100 Bergen Street, Newark, New Jersey 07103. Perspectives in Biology and Medicine · Autumn 1972 | II sociated with a decrease of available biogenic amines at the neuronal receptor sites in the region of the median eminence. There is a resultant suppression of the release of follicle stimulating hormone releasing factor (FRF), luteinizing hormone releasing factor (LRF), and prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF) from the median eminence. The anterior pituitary reacts by decreasing follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and by increasing prolactin secretion. The decrease of FSH and LH prevents ovulation and results in amenorrhea. The increased prolactin promotes lactation (and may support the persistence of the corpus luteum if prolactin is luteotropic). [P. 227] Most of the patients discussed at length in previous reports have had a single episode of pseudocyesis. Case histories of recurrent pseudocyesis have not, to my knowledge, been reported in detail, although there are brief accounts of up to four occurrences in one subject [4]. The following history describes a patient who suffered two episodes in a span of approximately four years. Case History The patient's parents were married near the turn of the century. It was a marriage of convenience, arranged because both fathers thought that it would consolidate a merger of their extensive international interests. At the time of her marriage, Mrs. T. was twentyfour , a plain, stout, highly religious woman with neither interest nor competence in the hectic social life which already appealed to her eighteen-year-old husband, and which was to appeal to him even more over the years. The couple had little in common: she had been born and educated in Europe and never felt as comfortable speaking English as she did speaking her native tongue. He was intelligent and attractive, and grew up to be competent and successful in business as well as in society . Both were fond of children, but they were disappointed when five successive pregnancies led to miscarriages or stillborn infants. By the time a living daughter, Mary, was born, on 2/18/16, even their shared affection for the child was not enough to bring them together. Mr. T., much warmer in temperament than his wife, was obviously delighted with his daughter. He indulged her, lavished affection on her, and loved to show her off to company. Her more restrained mother, on the other hand, showed little outward affection toward...",

      "abstract": "L’alcoolo-dépendance est une maladie chronique hautement récidivante dont l’enjeu principal est la prévention des rechutes. Les rechutes sont favorisées par le ressenti du sujet vis-à-vis de son environnement social [1]. L’alcoolo-dépendance entraîne des troubles cognitivo-comportementaux dont des déficits de reconnaissance émotionnelle et une altération des interactions sociales [2] majorant le risque de rechutes [3]. Ces troubles pourraient être liés à une altération du sentiment de familiarité. La familiarité se définit comme un sentiment de connaissance préalable d’un stimulus générant une émotion inconsciente, sans souvenir conscient de son identité [4]. Nous nous proposons d’étudier la familiarité aux visages dans l’alcoolo-dépendance. Douze patients alcoolo-dépendants (AD) étaient appariés en sexe et en âge à 12 témoins (T). Les participants ne présentaient ni trouble psychiatrique, ni neurologique, ni addiction en dehors d’un trouble d’usage sévère d’alcool pour le groupe AD (classification DSM-5). Des morphes entre visages familiers et inconnus (contenant 5 à 95 % du visage familier) étaient présentés. Les sujets devaient indiquer les visages leur semblant familiers. Un pourcentage de réponse « familier » était alors calculé par niveau de familiarité, permettant de construire une fonction psychométrique par sujet, et d’en déduire le seuil de familiarité (pourcentage de familiarité contenue dans le morphe pour lequel 50 % des stimuli étaient considérés comme familiers). Les interactions sociales étaient évaluées par une échelle de cognition sociale (MASC). Le seuil de familiarité était significativement plus faible dans le groupe AD que dans le groupe T (48,79 % versus 54,94 % – p = 0,025). Parallèlement les 2 groupes différaient sur les scores au MASC (AD : 26/45 ; T : 31/45 – p = 0,015). Ces résultats démontrent une hyperfamiliarité dans l’alcoolo-dépendance, associée à une altération de la cognition sociale. L’implication de l’altération de ces deux processus sur les risques de rechute est abordée.",

The spells generally appear during the first two years of life, but rarely before 6 months of age. They usually disappear spontaneously after 4 years of age and rarely recur after age 6 years. Breathholding episodes are observed almost exclusively in children with normal intelligence and do not cause demonstrable evidence of brain damage. However, they are frequently associated with or followed by behavioral disturbances. The familial incidence is high. Breathholding attacks are essentially innocuous and the general outlook is excellent. The associated unconsciousness and convulsions are very short and benign, and require no immediate care. The administration of antiepileptic or tranquilizing drugs or both is of no value. Treatment consists primarily of parent-child guidance and reassurance.",

Differentiating confusion, fear, or irritability following a seizure from a postictal psychosis requires careful history taking. Psychosis can also be the result of a comorbid illness; one should also consider potential causes such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The timing of symptoms is a key consideration when trying to determine if someone has a postictal psychosis. Postictal psychosis is classically preceded by a lucid interval, followed by a prolonged period of psychosis lasting more than 24 hours. Treatment with antipsychotic medications is often required. For many patients, antipsychotic medications can be discontinued once symptoms resolve.",

      "abstract": "There may be a strong underlying wish to return to primary narcissism, with accompanying hopelessness and unconscious shame. When shame is avoided, pathological narcissism, counterfeit behaviour, hostility or violence may result. A move by a patient into a merged state with the therapist may, therefore, signal anxiety due to the presence of unconscious shame. The way that the therapist deals with the projected shame may be crucial to the outcome of the therapy. The situation may become an intractable \"shame-guilt cycle\" in which there is a repetition-compulsion, without insight, of an unconscious sado-masochistic relationship in the transference and countertransference. Defences against shame are manifestations of a wish to hide from oneself or from the seeing other. Whatever the sequence of cause and effect, shame and sexuality are closely associated. Shame undoubtedly plays a part in many, if not all, psychological disturbances and may be the most important factor in some.",

The term, “sui generis,” emphasizes this. Addiction involves an intense focus on using, with a motivational salience to use frequently, and to engage in associated behavior, cognition, and conation -- to the point that it takes over the user’s life, superceding common sense, reasonable judgment, and acceptable behavior. Addiction is usually accompanied by physical dependence, but is not the same thing: that is, using to avoid withdrawal is not the same as using to gratify addictive craving. But physical dependence or other motivations may appear as “pseudo-addiction.” Addictive craving is not a psychological derivative of other motivations (though an addict will say otherwise). In its pathogenesis, occasional alcohol or drug use becomes routine. Then, regular use becomes a turning point for many, toward addiction.",

La experiencia clinica muestra situaciones concretas donde es probable que exista una cierta confusion de terminos. Asi, se pueden entender de manera erronea como sedacion paliativa los casos de tratamiento sintomatico del delirium hiperactivo en la etapa de ultimos dias (una situacion que se presenta a menudo como la primera causa de sedacion en agonia) o aquellos en que se lleva a cabo un aumento progresivo de la medicacion paliativa, que con frecuencia puede tener un efecto sedante, paralelo a la mayor intensidad de los sintomas en enfermos con un deterioro severo debido a la progresion de la enfermedad. En ambos casos se emplean farmacos con efecto sedante para aliviar las complicaciones clinicas y el sufrimiento en un enfermo que tiene la muerte cercana pero las circunstancias del enfermo, el objetivo de estos tratamientos y el modo en que se emplean no coinciden con la definicion de sedacion paliativa. EnglishPalliative sedation in defined as the deliberate reduction in the level of consciousness of the patient by administering the appropriate drugs in order to avoid intense suffering caused by one or more refractory symptoms; sedation in the patient who is in his last days or hours of life is assumed to be continuous and as deep as needed. Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

      "abstract": "Asphyxia describes any condition that results in oxygen deprivation and, in the unborn or soon-to-be-born infant, may occur prenatally in utero, during delivery or postnatally [1]. In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

There is a known association among women with previous history of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder and relapse during the menopausal transition. First-onset mood disorders during this time have been less studied. A literature review in PsycInfo Ovid of records pertaining to first-onset mood disorders during perimenopause showed that this multifactorial process involves hormonal fluctuations, with estrogen being a key player. In addition, vasomotor symptoms, previous negative life events, and socioeconomic status were found to contribute to first-onset mood disorders during perimenopause. Treatment options include established medication regimens for psychiatric conditions; however, hormone therapy also has proven beneficial for this patient population. Further research, particularly on bipolar disorder, is needed to develop a clear association between perimenopause and first-onset mood disorders.",

Only four essential neurological characteristics have to be considered: primary reflexes, convulsions, apathy or swallowing disorders, respiratory disorders.

      "title": "A Case of Forgotten Poisoning in a Patient Presenting with Speech Disorder",
      "abstract": "Anticholinergic poisoning is one of the most common causes of poisoning in the emergency department. Beautiful hawthorn (atropa belladonna), which is found in our country, is one of the plants that can cause anticholinergic syndrome. It is important in the differential diagnosis in cases progressing with general status disorder and loss of consciousness and psychotic findings. The onset of anticholinergic intoxication varies depending on the toxin and occurs within one to two hours following oral ingestion. The diagnosis of anticholinergic poisoning is based on clinical findings. Anticholinergic poisoning is easily diagnosed when a history of exposure to an anticholinergic substance is obtained and the patient shows altered mental status, delirium or hallucinations. However, in cases with no history and unknown exposure, the diagnosis of anticholinergic intoxication is considered when clinical signs and symptoms caused by mental status disorder and anticholinergic effects are detected on physical examination. A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of slurred speech, altered consciousness and facial shifting that started about 2 hours ago. On physical examination, the patient was incoopere and disoriented, GCS:12 eyes were spontaneously open, obeying orders but making unintelligible sounds, nuchal rigidity was suspiciously positive, bilateral babinski reflex was positive. On admission vital signs were blood pressure 144/72 mmHg, pulse 98/min, temperature 37 °C, SO2 94%, fingerstick blood glucose 104 mg/dl and ECG was in normal sinus rhythm. There were no acute pathologic findings on both brain CT and brain MR imaging. In the control physical examination, both pupils were mydriatic, IR -/- and the patient had dry mouth. According to the anamnesis obtained from another relative of the patient, it was learned that they ate spinach in the evening and speech disorder started afterwards. The patient was diagnosed with anticholinergic intoxication considering that the spinach eaten by the patient with clinical findings might have been mixed with the beautiful hawthorn weed. In this case report, we aimed to emphasize the importance of detailing the anamnesis and the necessity of a complete systemic examination in patients presenting with confusion and speech disorder.",

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

MUS are a heterogeneous group of symptoms and can involve almost all types of symptoms that patients present to their GP. Functional somatic syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), as well as symptoms stemming from a specific somatic disease that are more severe, more persistent, or limit functioning to a greater extent than expected, based on (objective) disease parameters, are also referred to as MUS. MUS represent a spectrum of severity from mild via moderate to severe, characterised by an increased number and duration of symptoms and functional limitations. Most of the time MUS are transient and self-limiting, but sometimes MUS persist, resulting in extensive investigations and referrals and unnecessary healthcare costs. Therefore, early recognition of MUS is of paramount importance. Although only 2.5% of the patients in general practice meet criteria for persistent or severe MUS (such multiple symptoms that persist for longer than 3 months resulting in severe functional limitations), GPs experience many difficulties in caring for these patients.2 For that reason the Dutch College of General Practitioners decided to publish the evidence-based primary care guideline on MUS, which provides …",

      "abstract": "Throughout history, various changes and ways of referring have given to this mental illness now known as schizophrenia. There is still no concrete explanation as to the onset of the disorder; it is considered that their presence tends to be more common in men than in women. Between possible triggers for schizophrenia it noted age of onset and genetic factors. The genetic risk for the disorder is not enough because approximately 60% of people with schizophrenia have no family history whatsoever. The environment unlike this factor demonstrates a higher weight. Classically they have divided into positive and negative symptoms. It must be remembered that not in all cases the same combination of symptoms occur as it is considered to schizophrenia as a heterogeneous disorder. The decrease in attention, memory or disturbances in executive functioning are also symptoms called cognitives, which can get to add to the traditional division of existing symptoms. These symptoms and signs should be continued for at least 6 months of persistence. To continue with the diagnosis, have to remember that persistence is the key to the process of psychological evaluation, and in this case that presents psychotic symptoms is recommended a regular contact with the patient.",

      "title": "Clinical approaches for poststroke seizure: a review",
      "abstract": "Poststroke seizure is a potential complication of stroke, which is the most frequent acute symptomatic seizure in adults. Patients with stroke may present with an abnormal or aggressive behavior accompanied by altered mental status and symptoms, such as hemiparesis, dysarthria, and sensory deficits. Although stroke manifestations that mimic seizures are rare, diagnosing poststroke seizures can be challenging when accompanied with negative postictal symptoms. Differential diagnoses of poststroke seizures include movement disorders, syncope, and functional (nonepileptic) seizures, which may present with symptoms similar to seizures. Furthermore, it is important to determine whether poststroke seizures occur early or late. Seizures occurring within and after 7 d of stroke onset were classified as early and late seizures, respectively. Early seizures have the same clinical course as acute symptomatic seizures; they rarely recur or require long-term antiseizure medication. Conversely, late seizures are associated with a risk of recurrence similar to that of unprovoked seizures in a patient with a focal lesion, thereby requiring long-term administration of antiseizure medication. After diagnosis, concerns regarding treatment strategies, treatment duration, and administration of primary and secondary prophylaxis often arise. Antiseizure medication decisions for the initiation of short-term primary and long-term secondary seizure prophylaxis should be considered for patients with stroke. Antiseizure drugs such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, phenytoin, and valproate may be administered. Poststroke seizures should be diagnosed systematically through history with differential diagnosis; in addition, classifying them as early or late seizures can help to determine treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

Le deficit est brutal, temporaire (de 1 a 24 heures), et touche preferentiellement les patients âges (âge moyen 65 ans). A la phase aigue, les patients presentent une amnesie anterograde complete, une amnesie retrograde tres variable, (pouvant s'etendre de quelques jours a une dizaine d'annees) et un etat d'anxiete important se manifestant par un questionnement repetitif. La recuperation est spontanee, se fait sans sequelles et la recidive est rare.

Ces nouveaux elements apportes par l'IRM relancent la discussion sur les differentes hypotheses physiopathologiques de l'Ictus Amnesique. En effet, l'unicite des lesions observees traduisant probablement une cascade metabolique identique conforte les hypotheses de la congestion veineuse et du stress metabolique. Pourtant, aucune des hypotheses actuelles ne peut expliquer la survenue de tous les Ictus Amnesiques.

      "title": "Sexual Behavior, Function and Satisfaction in Headache Associated with Sexual Activity: A Systematic Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Headache associated with sexual activity (HSA) is the painful event of head and neck precipitated only by sexual activity. The negative impact of sexuality is expected to be more severe in HSA patients and their partners than other headache disorder. In addition, social and cultural taboo may conceal sexual problem or hinder seeking counseling for sexual perplexity. A sufficient scientific evidence is therefore needed to clarify the misunderstanding and schedule appropriate education in clinical practice. Methods: A systematic review of literature was completed to elucidate the sexual behavior, function and satisfaction in HSA patients and their partners. Results: A total of 97 publications are eligible after careful screening. However, most of the studies focus on the etiopathogenesis or treatment. Sexual change was mentioned in 23 publications. Orgasmic headache is the most frequent type of HSA. The HSA occurs more frequent in dyadic than extradyadic sexual activity. Intercourse is the leading sexual act for HSA occurrence, following by masturbation. A few patients suffer HSA under specific sexual position, like kneeling, and trigger, such as cannabis. Pain can be rapidly ceased in half of patients when sexual activity was halted. Sexual function and sexual satisfaction may decrease in HSA patient and partner but improve after pain reversal. Conclusions: A shortage of sexuality data of HSA is documented in literature but that still clarifies the extradyadic and masturbatory effect on HSA occurrence. Nevertheless, HSA disturbs sexual function and satisfaction in patients and their partners. The pathogenesis of pain includes two components, the hypersympathetic status and exertional action. Therefore, physician can schedule their education and counseling for HSA according to these findings. Further investigation for sexual function and satisfaction is warranted.",

      "title": "Risk, Disorder and Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "abstract": "The name schizophrenia comes from a combination of the Greek words shizeiu - to split and fren - reason. Eugen Bleuler has introduced the name schizophrenia in 1991 and the goal was to replace the negative meaning of the disease. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that does not allow a sick person to distinguish the real from the unreal experience, interferes with daily thinking and emotional experiences towards others and disrupts normal social functioning. The symptoms that occur in this disease are delusions, hallucinations, illusions, disorganization and impoverishment of mental functions. The symptoms of the disease are divided into positive and negative. The disease occurs between the ages of 15 and 35, and we recognize it by its early symptoms, sometimes these symptoms are absent, so the disease is noticed only in the acute phase, only the beginning of the disease is gradual or sudden. The diagnosis of schizophrenia requires that the patient's symptoms be present for at least six months and that there is a prodromal phase that lasts for another 5 months, with some symptoms maintaining, but in a milder form. Schizophrenia is treated with drugs, but they are not enough to achieve the highest possible level of independence in patients later in life, so psychosocial methods are also used. It is of great importance to involve the patient's family, environment and community in the treatment process so that the return to normal life and recovery is as fast and high quality as possible. Schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental illness, it is caused by prejudice, stigmatization entails discrimination, which ultimately has negative consequences for the patient and his family. A nurse is the person who spends the most time with a patient with schizophrenia, so she is the only one who can notice problems in the field of health care. Nursing documentation is also of great importance and the first step in patient care. To solve the problem, the nurse selects the most appropriate nursing interventions that are patient-centered and individualized for himself. A good and quality relationship of trust between the nurse and the patient is the most important characteristic of quality health care.",

Cases may go underdiagnosed, misdirected, or commonly treated inappropriately. Clinical studies have conclusively shown an obvious link between childhood trauma and the emergence of symptoms. Transient dissociative episodes are common and normative phenomena during childhood. We reported a case of an 8-year-old boy, who presented with a 5-day history of hallucinatory behavior. He was causing significant nuisances, sudden onset of shouting aggressively, and behavioral changes, associated with neuropsychiatric presentation such as repetitive irregular movement involving his head, neck, and upper limb. There was an asynchrony of symptoms exhibited which were unexplained by clinical semiology or patterns. He was screaming in fear, talking irrelevantly, and acting suspiciously. This was his first presentation to the hospital and no features to suggest organicity. There was no family history of mental illness. No substances, or alcohol and drug usage Serial investigation turned out to be normal and unremarkable. The episodes get frequent whenever parents or hospital staff give more attention toward him. He was given a low dose of antipsychotics, but no obvious rapid changes were observed afterward. Further exploration noted, his parents reported that the patient had been very worked up with past related trauma at school and constantly talking about it. He was afraid, distressed, and anxious as he felt something bad would happen to him. There were significant issues related to attachment figures in this boy, possibly the absent parenting style.

Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together.

Representaciones que el analista habia parcialmente negado hasta ese momento y que, a partir de ahi, poco a poco iran apareciendo en la conciencia con motivo de una ausencia del paciente. francaisApres qu'une analyse se soit installee dans une economie nevrotique apparemment temperee, le travail analytique peut se voir parfois confronte a des resistances drastiques de l' ordre du masochisme qui sont en rapport a des troubles de la pensee et qui expriment une pathologie du clivage dans les relations et les identi:fications primaires, lesquelles n' etaient pas jusque-la veritablement apparues dans le champ de la communication, et qui, de ce fait, avaient echappe ( ou pu echapper) al' analyste. Dans le cas de figure processuelle proposee l' angoisse identitaire du patient va apparaitre a la faveur de representations et de pensees contradictoires (sinon paradoxales) chez l'analyste lui-meme concernant son patient, representations que l' analyste avait jusque-la partiellement deniees et dont il va prendre conscience, petit-a-petit (ou pas-a-pas), a l'occasion d'une absence du patient. EnglishWhen analysis is estabhshed in an apparently moderately neurotic economy, the analytic work may at times be confronted with radical resistance of a moral masochism type closely related to thought disorders reflecting pathological splitting the primary relations and identifications, which had not appeared until that moment in the communication, and hence would have escaped (or would have been able to escape) the analyst. In the case of procedural figure postulated by the author, the patient's identity anxiety will appear in the analyst's s representations and contradictory ( even paradoxical) thoughts towards his patient. These are representations that the analyst had up until now partially denied and which, from this point on, gradually appear to consciousness owing to an absence or lack in the patient.",

The worsening of psychic state and full development of anorexia nervosa symptoms occurred during stressful life event (e.g. avoidance by sexual partner). The majority of those patients had present and past (from adolescence) various anxiety and depressive disorders and personality disorders (obsessive--compulsive, borderline). In most of the women older than 40 years, anorexia nervosa comorbid with depressive disorders, less often with mixed, anxiety--depressive, disorders. The symptoms occurred during menopause, after loss of life-partner (separation or death). It was not established, which of these disorders appeared as the first one. The prognosis was better for the second group of those patients.",

In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

The connection between depression and alterations in gonadal function may have further psychophysiological implications.

Future studies using these constructs will be of use in further clarifying psychological and neuroendocrinological relationships.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

Psychologic assessment can be incorporated into routine prenatal evaluation. Typically, patients who cope poorly during pregnancy have had previous emotional difficulty. Transient emotional disturbances during the early stages of pregnancy are not unusual. Treatment consists of providing support, education, and opportunity for the patient to ventilate her feelings. These interventions can be provided by the sensitive primary care physician who is willing and able to commit the time, to listen, and to communicate. Drug therapy should usually be avoided. Postpartum blues is common, occurring most often in those who experienced emotional distress during pregnancy and in those with a history of premenstrual tension. Management ideally begins before delivery. Treatment of postpartum depression or psychosis involves use of medication and/or psychotherapy.

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "title": "Crying Behaviour and Its Importance for Psychosocial Development in Children",
      "abstract": "Introduction For generations, parents have experienced the stress and frustration of increased, inconsolable crying in their infants in the first three to five months of life. In its most extreme manifestations, this increased crying has been considered a clinical problem, often referred to as “colic.” The most extreme and dangerous consequence for the infant is abuse or neglect, and especially the specific form of abuse referred to as “shaken baby syndrome.” Many of the properties of crying are unique to the first few months, and therefore generate their own particular problems. Later in the first year of life, the amount of crying is much reduced. However, more stable individual differences between infants appear. Those infants who tend to be more reactive and to respond negatively (by crying) can be completely normal, but they are often thought of clinically as having a “difficult temperament.” If the crying is associated with difficulties feeding and sleeping, they are often thought of in clinical terms as having behavioural regulation problems (“regulatory disorder”). While the vast majority of these crying behaviours are not associated with disease or pathology, the meaning of the crying behaviour for the infants’ caregivers (“perceptual set”) is usually a determinant of its psychosocial consequences for the infant. Although many questions remain, research findings have changed our understanding of the nature and significance of this early behaviour.",

Expert system architecture which has a concept adapted by psychologists in making the diagnosis, the presence of disorder diagnoses the condition should have more than two symptoms of the disorder which used diagnosis. The process of the expert system to infer the types of psychological disorders experienced by the client begins looking for the symptoms first owned by the client, this is in accordance with the mechanism of the forward chaining and the current uncertainty in handling concludes the counseling because the rules are not met to do with the data counseling clients using bayes formula to get the value of early diagnosis possible so users still get the diagnosis of psychological disorders in clinical psychology expert system.",

      "title": "Foetal pain?",
      "abstract": "The majority of commentary on foetal pain has looked at the maturation of neural pathways to decide a lower age limit for foetal pain. This approach is sensible because there must be a minimal necessary neural development that makes pain possible. Very broadly, it is generally agreed that the minimal necessary neural pathways for pain are in place by 24 weeks gestation. Arguments remain, however, as to the possibility of foetal pain before or after 24 weeks. Some argue that the foetus can feel pain earlier than 24 weeks because pain can be supported by subcortical structures. Others argue that the foetus cannot feel pain at any stage because it is maintained in a state of sedation in the womb and lacks further neural and conceptual development necessary for pain. Much of this argument rests on the definition of terms such as 'wakefulness' and 'pain'. If a behavioural and neural reaction to a noxious stimulus is considered sufficient for pain, then pain is possible from 24 weeks and probably much earlier. If a conceptual subjectivity is considered necessary for pain, however, then pain is not possible at any gestational age. Regardless of how pain is defined, it is clear that pain for conceptual beings is qualitatively different than pain for non-conceptual beings. It is therefore a mistake to draw an equivalence between foetal pain and pain in the older infant or adult.",

      "abstract": "AIDS, the acquired immune – deficiency syndrome (sometimes called “Slim Disease”) is a newly described, usual fatal illness caused by a retrovirus known as the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) which breaks down the body‟s immune system, leaving the victim vulnerable, to a host of life-threatening opportunistic infectious, neurological disorders or unusual malignancies among the special feature of HIV infection is that a person once infected will be infected for life. Strictly speaking, the term AIDS refers only to the last stage of HIV infection. AIDS can be called our modern pandemic, affecting both industrialized and developing countries.\r\nA number of social conflicts such as fear of exposure of diagnosis and being a member of a stigmatized group are commonly experienced by people who have HIV. Crisis Points – Several Crisis Points occur during the course of HIV disease. The diagnosis of HIV may be first crisis with the initial diagnosis the person often feels intense anxiety, fear, anger and guilt and may act impulsively. High levels of anxiety and depression may continue for 2-3 months and may be exhibited in agitation, risky sexual behavior, crying and suicidal ideation and attempts. In fact symptoms of depression and anxiety may overlap with HIV symptoms complicating diagnostic and treatment efforts.\r\nThe National AIDS Control Organization of India (NACO) estimates the number of people within India as 5-1 million in 2004. India has the second highest number of people living with HIV/AIDS with the world after South Africa. India Accounts for almost to persons of the million people living with HIV/AIDS globally.\r\nThe objectives of the study was to assess level of depression and coping strategies among HIV Clients. A descriptive Research design was adopted for this study. The study was conducted in We Care Social Service Society, Singaperumal among 100 clients. The data was collected from HIV Clients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria by using Beck's depression Inventory and Lazarus coping Inventory. The Interview was conducted in Tamil. Ethical aspects were considered throughout the study. The conceptual framework adopted for this study was modified Pender‟s Health Promotion Model.\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\nThe study findings revealed that among 100 HIV Client, 11% of HIV clients had mild depression, 15% of HIV Clients had sever depression and 74% of HIV clients had moderated depression. It also revealed that 3% of HIV Clients had inadequate coping, 7% of HIV Clients had adequate coping and 90% of HIV Clients had moderately adequate coping.\r\nThe Psychiatry Nurse, as a Nurse Educator should aim at reorienting general education system and professional curriculum to suitably incorporate the preventive measures and management strategies regarding HIV. As a Psychiatric Nurse the investigator has provided information to the entire subjects about HIV and method to overcome the problems.",

If the patient's romantic ideas shaped private fantasies instead of determined public behavior, there would be little cause for concern. The situation becomes critical when the fantasies are dramatized in real life with an unsuspecting and usually unwilling man cast in the role of the lover. The woman dwells on the feelings she ascribes to her \"suitor.\" Such delusional thinking, resulting from an ego defect and producing bizarre actions, may be shaped largely by feelings of being unloved or even unloveable; a narcissistic blow is overcome by a grandiose fantasy. Cases in which erotomania is prominent are usually diagnosed as paranoid state or paranoid schizophrenia.",

A tic is a non-voluntary movement of the body or a vocal sound that can occur suddenly and is repeated, often rapidly. With appropriate sensitivity, the interviewer should physically demonstrate these tics when inquiring about their presence. If duration of motor tics is less than one year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder or Unspecified Tic Disorder and skip to Vocal Tics. Symptoms must have persisted for at least one year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than one year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> There is evidence that concussion can increase the risk of sustaining a subsequent musculoskeletal (MSK) injury up to 24-months post injury. The reason for increased risk is unknown although irregularities in brain and motor function post-concussion that are sustained beyond clinical recovery have been implicated. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine the likelihood of UK High Performance System athletes sustaining a subsequent MSK injury within a 4-month period post-concussion. <h3>Design</h3> Retrospective Cohort Study. A concussion was identified by a medical records diagnostic code of 'concussion without loss of consciousness', 'concussion with loss of consciousness', or 'concussion not otherwise specified'. The attrition rate is the average occurrence of an MSK injury during the 4-month period. An attrition rate for all MSK injuries was determined using the formula; 'Number of MSK Injuries'/'Number of Athletes'. An attrition rate for all MSK injuries subsequent to a concussion was determined by the formula; 'Number of MSK injuries that occur in the 4-months after a concussion'/'Number of Athletes who sustained a concussion'. <h3>Setting</h3> UK High Performance System Olympic and Paralympic athletes <h3>Participants</h3> 1979 athletes from 33 sports <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> MSK attrition rate compared to MSK/Concussion attrition rate. <h3>Results</h3> Athletes were found to have a 27% increased risk of suffering a MSK injury 4-months post-concussion, with the overall MSK attrition rate of 0.78, increasing to 0.99 post-concussion. A higher MSK/Concussion attrition rate was identified in 26 of 33 sports. <h3>Conclusions</h3> There is an increased risk of sustaining a MSK injury post-concussion amongst UK Olympic and Paralympic programme athletes. Therefore, identifying and addressing risk factors for subsequent MSK injury should be considered during concussion rehabilitation. This might include visio-motor, oculo-motor, balance and neuromuscular impairments alongside screening, monitoring and programming physical preparation to ensure any work-load imbalances associated with time away from sport are addressed.",

Depersonalization has been well-documented in medical literature for more than 100 years, but this book, the first definitive work on the subject, is long overdue. Everyone feels “unreal” from time to time. It may happen after a traumatic event, while in new or foreign surroundings, or in times of severe stress. As a defense mechanism, depersonalization serves a purpose—to mentally distance an individual from horrific or overwhelming circumstances. But this mechanism can go awry and exhibit a darker side, which manifests itself as depersonalization disorder.",

Women are at higher risk for depressive episodes beginning at early adolescence and then throughout the life span. Unipolar depressive disorders can onset at any point in the life span, but are most prevalent in late adolescence through early to mid-adulthood. Bipolar disorder (BD)s generally onset before mid-adulthood; new cases are rare thereafter. More severe cases of unipolar and bipolar disorders are characterized by a chronic/recurrent course. Both unipolar and bipolar disorders are commonly comorbid with other forms of psychopathology; overall severity and poorer outcome over time is associated with comorbidity. If gender differences are of interest, the effects of potential etiological factors are measured in persons of both genders and their associations with depressive disorders are statistically compared across genders.",

      "title": "The Impact Of Menopause On The Musculoskeletal System: A Practical Overview",
      "abstract": "Key Points • Menopause is associated with a rapid decline in estrogen, which significantly affects bone, joint, and muscle health. • Bone loss accelerates during the menopause transition, with up to a 10% reduction in spine bone density within the first five years after the final menstrual period. • Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been shown to be effective in preserving bone density and reducing fracture risk. • Musculoskeletal symptoms, such as pain, stiffness, and joint discomfort are common and often underrecognized during the menopause transition, sometimes leading to misdiagnosis. • Foundational strategies for preserving musculoskeletal health during and after menopause include lifestyle interventions such as strength training, balance exercises, and adequate protein and vitamin D intake. Menopause represents an important phase in a woman's reproductive life, marked by the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, signalling the end of the reproductive years. In North America, the average age of onset is 50.5 years, generally occurring between the ages of 45 and 55. Hormonal fluctuations and symptoms of hypoestrogenism—such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood and cognitive changes—can begin up to 10 years before menopause, during the perimenopausal or menopause transition. These symptoms stem from fluctuations in sex hormones, primarily estrogen, which has receptors distributed throughout the body and impacts nearly every organ system, including the bones, joints, and muscles. In this review, we will summarize the effects of hypoestrogenism on bone, joint, and muscle health during and beyond the menopause transition.",

Amenorrhea is often mentioned as a symptom of depression. Other menstrual disturbances of unknown etiology which are usually classified as hypothalamic amenorrhea might also be a part of this spectrum. The connection between depression and alterations in gonadal function may have further psychophysiological implications. This could, in part, be due to the sequence of neuroendocrine events associated with depression, leading to decreased FSH and LH secretion from the anterior pituitary. Future studies using these constructs will be of use in further clarifying psychological and neuroendocrinological relationships.",

      "abstract": "Acute symptomatic seizures are those caused or provoked by an\r\nacute medical or neurological insult and it is as common as epilepsy in the\r\nmedical wards. Acute symptomatic seizures differ from epilepsy in several\r\nimportant aspects. First, unlike epilepsy, these seizures have a clearly\r\nidentifiable proximate cause, to the extent that one can never be certain of\r\na causal association. When one considers the temporal sequence of acute\r\nsymptomatic seizures (e.g.uremia, head injury, or stroke immediately\r\npreceding a seizure), the biologic plausibility (acute disruption of brain\r\nintegrity or metabolic homeostasis) and in many cases the dose effect\r\n(severity of injury correlated with the risk for seizures) all quite\r\ncompellingly indicate causation. Although a risk ratio for the immediate\r\nassociation between cause and effect has not been calculated, it must be\r\nenormous. Second, unlike epilepsy, acute symptomatic seizures are not\r\ncharacterized by a tendency to recur. The risk for subsequent epilepsy may\r\nbe increased in individuals experiencing such insults; in general, one does\r\nnot expect seizures to recur unless the underlying condition recurs. \r\nThe maximum incidence of seizures occurred in the age group of 60\r\nto 70 years in the study.\r\nCerebrovascular disease was the most common etiology observed in\r\nour study. Among cerebrovascular disease, ischemic cerebral\r\ninfarction was the most common cause. Central nervous system\r\ninfections, was the second most common cause followed by\r\nmetabolic causes in our study. So all efforts should be taken to\r\nevaluate the patients who presented with seizures in the elderly\r\npatients to identify the etiology, for accurate management.\r\nPartial seizures was the most common seizure type encountered in\r\nthe study.\r\nImmediate non contrast CT brain was useful, for emergency\r\npatients, presenting with seizures to guide appropriate acute\r\nmanagement. MRI Brain was useful in detecting lesions, which were\r\nmissed in CT Brain. Both CT Brain and MRI Brain were\r\nindispensable in patients with acute symptomatic seizures in the\r\nelderly.",

      "abstract": "After trauma, it is often possible to prevent, or at least reduce the effect of, certain medical sequelae if intervention occurs within a particular time period: \"the golden hour(s)\". The possibility of a similar window of opportunity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is discussed here. The essence of acute distress management should be to help contain and attenuate emotional reaction, and to encourage a return to full function and activity. Early intervention at this point could prevent the subsequent development of PTSD. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that amnesia of the traumatic event is associated with a decreased prevalence of PTSD, and that debriefing is not necessarily beneficial. Randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed in order to examine what psychological and/or pharmacological interventions should or should not be made during the \"golden hours\" following trauma.",

It is often referred to in the literature as “transverse myelitis” or “acute transverse myelitis”. Myelopathy and by extension myelitis, can present as pyramidal (motor), sensory, and/or autonomic dysfunction to varying degrees. Symptoms typically develop over hours to days and worsen over days to weeks. Sensory symptoms usually present as paresthesia ascending from the feet with or without back pain at or near the level of the myelitis. A cervical level focal myelitis can present as sensory symptoms restricted to the feet without ascending extension. Motor symptoms often include weakness that preferentially affects the flexors of the legs and the extensors of the arms (pyramidal distribution of weakness) and can include sphincter dysfunction. This is the case of a 55 years old female patient who develops sudden onset abdominal abscess one year after bariatric surgery that was complicated by an extensive infectious myelitis and cerebral abscesses without any cerebral symptoms. She received adequate antibiotherapy treatment with good evolution. This case is among the first in the medical literature that has occurred one year after bariatric surgery complicated by an abdominal and cerebral abscesses, and extensive infectious myelitis. We discussed all types of myelitis including, the autoimmune and the infectious origin. We showed the progressive evolution by showing MRI sequences. We emphasized about the importance of rapid initiation of the antibiotherapy as well as adding glucocorticoids.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which start shortly before or at the onset of menses and which could last for 3 days. In particular, PD negatively impacts the quality of life (QOL) of young females and is the main reason behind their absenteeism from school or work. It is suggested that increased intrauterine secretion of prostaglandins F2α and E2 are responsible for the pelvic pain associated with this disorder. Its associated symptoms are physical and/or psychological. Its physical symptoms include headache, lethargy, sleep disturbances, tender breasts, various body pains, disturbed appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and increased urination, whereas its psychological symptoms include mood disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, and irritability. While its diagnosis is based on patients' history, symptoms, and physical examination, its treatment aims to improve the QOL through the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and/or the use of non-pharmacological aids (e.g., topical heat application and exercise). Patients must be monitored to measure their response to treatment, assess their adherence, observe potential side effects, and perform further investigations, if needed.",

      "title": "Parasomnias",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical and/or experiential phenomena accompanying sleep that involve skeletal muscle activity (movements, behaviours), autonomic nervous system changes, and/or emotional-perceptual events. Parasomnias can emerge during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of sleep; therefore, all of sleep carries a vulnerability for parasomnias. Parasomnias can be objectively diagnosed by means of polysomnography (i.e. the physiologic monitoring of sleep—figures 4.14.4.1, 4.14.4.2), and can be successfully treated in the majority of cases. Understanding of the parasomnias, based on polysomnographic documentation, has expanded greatly over the past two decades, as new disorders have been identified, and as known disorders have been recognized to occur more frequently, across a broader age group, and with more serious consequences than previously understood. Parasomnias demonstrate how our instinctual behaviours, such as locomotion, feeding, sex, and aggression, can be released during sleep, itself a basic instinct. There are at least eight reasons why parasomnias should be of interest and importance to psychiatrists: 1 Parasomnias can be misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated as a psychiatric disorder. 2 Parasomnias can be a direct manifestation of a psychiatric disorder, e.g. dissociative disorder, nocturnal bulimia nervosa. 3 The emergence and/or recurrence of a parasomnia can be triggered by stress. 4 Psychotropic medications can induce the initial emergence of a parasomnia, or aggravate a preexisting parasomnia. 5 Parasomnias can cause psychological distress or can induce or reactivate a psychiatric disorder in the patient or bed partner on account of repeated loss of self-control during sleep and sleep-related injuries. 6 Familiarity with the parasomnias will allow psychiatrists to be more fully aware of the various medical and neuro-logical disorders, and their therapies, that can be associated with disturbed (sleep-related) behaviour and disturbed dreaming. 7 Parasomnias present a special opportunity for interlinking animal basic science research (including parasomnia animal models) with human (sleep) behavioural disorders. 8 Parasomnias carry forensic implications, as exemplified by the newly-recognized entity of ‘Parasomnia Pseudo-suicide.’ Also, psychiatrists are often asked to render an expert opinion in medicolegal cases pertaining to sleep-related violence.",

This presentation notes the lack of description in the literature of the events which lead to and culminate in a psychotic episode. A phenomenological account is offered. The description of the pre-psychotic and psychotic break presented here has some resemblance to a dream state. Nightmares and the psychotic break also have similar qualities. Through systematic interviews 23 adult, male schizophrenic patients described their first psychotic break. If over 50% of the sample commented on a symptom, it was included in the interpretation.",

      "title": "Provoked and reflex seizures: Surprising or common?",
      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

The presence of seizure discharges in the limbic portions of the tem­ porallobes leads to a global hyposexuality in the majority of cases. The dis­ appearance of these epileptic potentials-either postoperatively, after fits, or during control with anticonvulsant therapy-sometimes leads to normali­ zation of the sexual drive and sometimes to hypersexual episodes. 2. Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by a severe disturbance of paroxysmal behaviour: a disordered sexuality with inability to experience an orgasm, and an increase in impulsive irritability with a tendency towards outbursts of anger and rage. 3. One can oppose the limbic excitatory syndrome with its hypo­ sexuality and episodic hyperaggressiveness to the limbic depression syn­ drome with its tendency towards hypersexuality and tame behaviour. The latter corresponds to the Kluver-Bucy syndrome. At the level of the limbic system there may be a reciprocal inhibition of the bias towards sex and towards aggression. 4. Attempts at treating the limbic excitatory syndrome -i.e. the exces­ sive irritability of some temporal lobe epileptics-with a progesterone com­ pound appear promising.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory.

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

Previously, it was assumed that a single cause might explain these deaths. Subsequently, it has been found that several pathologic entities that are often virtually indistinguishable from SIDS can cause sudden death in infants. A commonly held concept is that for a SIDS death to occur, at least three conditions must be present, the so-called “triple-risk model.”1 First, the infant must have a congenital or acquired underlying vulnerability. Second, there must be a maturational process creating a peak age of vulnerability, occurring at age 2 to 6 months. Finally, a precipitating stress must be present that brings about the sudden death, generally assumed to be cardiovascular or respiratory in origin. Given these concepts, there has been great interest in discovering the source of underlying vulnerability, either physiologic …",

It should be of interest to psychiatry professionals looking to investigate the prodromal phase of psychosis. This case is regarding a 50-year-old, Caucasian male. He presented to clinic with a feeling of excitement. Despite being referred for suicidal ideation, he described himself as \"the happiest guy that I know. I wake up every morning feeling excited.\" This original case should highlight the possibility of this phenomenon in other patients.

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen.

The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) in adults is a state of continuous seizures lasting more than 5 minutes, or rapidly recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness. The overall US and European estimated crude incidence rate of SE ranges from 6.8 to 41/100,000/yr. The etiologies of SE include primary central nervous system pathologies and systemic disorders. The two basic mechanisms involved in the genesis of SE are an excess of excitatory activity and a loss of normal inhibitory neurotransmission. Mortality associated with SE can be as high as 26% for the average adult. Early recognition and treatment are important for improving the chances for a good outcome. The first line of treatment is an intravenous benzodiazepine, with lorazepam being the current preferred agent. All patients with SE who remain with altered awareness 20 to 30 minutes after cessation of clinical seizures should undergo electroencephalographic studies, because up to 20% of patients without clinical evidence of seizures after initial treatment can have nonconvulsive SE.",

En la anestesiología hay mayor riesgo de dependencia a opioides e hipnóticos que en otras especialidades y puede llegar a afectar al 1% de los médicos anestesiólogos. La fisiopatología del trastorno por uso de sustancias tiene hechos comunes para diferentes drogas. Interactúan la vulnerabilidad genética y factores psicosociales como predisponentes y los efectos psicobiológicos de la sustancia como factor gatillante. En el caso de los anestesiólogos, la sustancia se encuentra en el lugar de trabajo y por lo tanto, el individuo está constantemente expuesto. Una disfunción previa del sistema de recompensa en el circuito mesocorticolímbico o causada por la exposición a la sustancia adictiva es la piedra central de la neurobiología de las adicciones. Los opioides, anfetaminas, canabinoides, alcohol y nicotina, son algunas de las sustancias exógenas que activan el circuito y causan inicialmente un efecto hedónico que reforzará la conducta por repetir la experiencia. Con el tiempo la interacción con la droga será para evitar los síntomas de abstinencia. Dada la exposición laboral de los anestesiólogos, es necesario prevenir, detectar y tratar precozmente a quienes están abusando de sustancias durante su ejercicio profesional. Por las características de estos fármacos, aspectos psicológicos especiales de los médicos y el contexto laboral se hace necesario un tratamiento especializado y en anestesiólogos la reinserción laboral debe ser un proceso controlado, gradual y con un seguimiento prolongado.

Substances use disorder has common mechanisms of disease regardless which drug has been abused. There are interactions between genetic vulnerability and psychosocial facts as a risk factor and psychobiological effects of the substance as a triggering factor. Anesthesiologists use addictive substances in their patients at work everyday, therefore individual is constantly exposed. Previous reward dysfunction or triggered by drugs exposure on mesocorticolimbic circuit is central stone of the neurobiology of addictions. Opioids, amphetamines, cannabinoids, alcohol and nicotine, are exogenous agents whose activates the reward circuit generating a hedonic effect that reinforces drug-seeking behavior. Meanwhile a rising tolerance ocurs and positive reinforcement decreases. Finally substance will be used to avoid withdrawal. Because anesthesiologists are occupationally exposed, it is necessary to reduce risk by preventing strategies and early detection who are abusing substances in a professional frame. Because drugs characteristics and physicians psychological aspects a specialized treatment team is required and reentry to labor should be in a controlled and long follow-up.",

      "title": "Premedication: Is clonidine the answer?",
      "abstract": "It is generally accepted that apprehension and anxiety should be controlled before children are transported to the operating room for anesthetic induction. Anxiety during the perioperative period has been described as a subjective feeling of apprehension, fear, and nervousness.[12] It may be expressed by children in various forms, including tearfulness, screaming, clinging to parents or caregivers, apathy, and withdrawal. In addition to facilitating the induction of anesthesia and providing a calm perioperative environment, the benefits of effective premedication may be long lasting. Extended postoperative maladaptive behaviors, such as new onset enuresis, feeding difficulties, apathy, withdrawal, and sleep disturbances have been attributed to uncontrolled anxiety before anesthesia and surgery in children.[12] Up to 60% of all children may manifest undesirable behavioral changes at 2 weeks postoperatively and 20% of children continue to exhibit some of those behavioral changes for as long as 6 months following a surgical procedure.[13] In addition to the psychologic complications, inadequate premedication, can also add to the stress response during the perioperative period resulting in a series of hormonal, immunologic, and metabolic changes culminating in a negative nitrogen balance, tissue catabolism, delayed wound healing, and even immunosuppression, which may potentially increase perioperative morbidity and extend the hospital stay.[4–6] Various factors are involved in the development of preoperative anxiety in children presenting for surgery. The primary mechanism in the developmental scheme of children that results in perioperative anxiety is separation from caregivers. Separation anxiety usually begins after 9 months of age, with children 1–5 years of age having the highest risk for developing extreme anxiety.[12] The level of parental anxiety has also been shown to be an important factor in the development and evolution of the child's anxiety.[2] Previous unpleasant experiences during clinic visits, anesthetic induction, surgery, or hospitalization have a strong association with the development of subsequent preoperative anxiety.[2] Awareness of these factors may help identify the high-risk population and allow for appropriate management with either behavioral or pharmacological therapies to allay preoperative anxiety. Historically, the rationale for preoperative medication was to minimize the side effects of the commonly used volatile anesthetic agents at the time, including ether and cyclopropane. As such, anticholinergic agents were commonly administered, generally via the intramuscular route, prior to anesthetic induction to prevent salivation and bradycardia.[6] With the advent of sevoflurane for inhalation induction and its decreased incidence of bradycardia and the elimination of the need for an antisialogogue, the focus of premedication has shifted. Additionally, the art of premedication has evolved over time so that in modern anesthetic practice the goal is to ally anxiety, thereby making the experience of anesthesia and surgery more pleasant and less traumatic.[6] In the United States, the oral route (80%) is the preferred method for the administration of premedication.[2] In selective cases, other routes of administration have been used, including intranasal, sublingual, intramuscular, and rectal.[2] These alternative routes are generally chosen when the patient refuses oral administration or when comorbid conditions preclude the oral route. Although it has been argued that the use of an oral premedication violates the general policy of holding patients nil per os, it has been clearly demonstrated that the use of the oral route for a premedicant does not significantly alter gastric residual volumes.[7] As far as the choice of the agent, midazolam is the most commonly used agent for premedication, being chosen in up to 85% of children. Alternative agents include ketamine, transmucosal fentanyl, meperidine, and the α2-adrenergic agents, such as clonidine.[2] Introduced into clinical use in the 1980s, midazolam was quickly accepted and became the wonder-drug for premedication, especially in the adult population where it has been suggested that no one enters the operating room without receiving 2 mg of midazolam intravenously. Midazolam, a relatively shorter-acting benzodiazepine when compared with diazepam, has become the most frequently used agent for the premedication of children due to several reasons. The perceived benefits of midazolam as a premedicant in children include its rapid onset, reliability in achieving sedation and anxiolysis, and its availability in an oral formulation with a commercially available liquid, which contains 2 mg/mL of midazolam in a cherry-flavored syrup.[8–10] However, in many centers, when the commercially available solution is not available, the standard intravenous formulation (5 mg/mL) is used via the oral route. In such a practice, the benzyl alcohol which is in the intravenous solution as a preservative makes the solution somewhat unpalatable with the need to mask the flavor by placing it in some type of syrup (acetaminophen) or sweet solution (honey). When this is done, alterations in the absorption characteristics and oral bioavailability may occur due to changes in the ring structure of the parent compound.[11] Therefore, the search for the ideal premedicant continues given the potential concerns of midazolam, such as the bitter taste, intense burning or stinging from nasal administration and side effects, such as hiccoughs, cognitive impairment, delayed awakening from short procedures, long-term behavioral disturbances, and respiratory depression.[1011] Clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, has emerged as a potential alternative to midazolam as premedication in pediatric patients.[12–14] Since the first report of its use as a premedicant in the pediatric population in 1993,[13] there have been numerous reports in the pediatric population demonstrating its efficacy in this clinical scenario.[15–19] Various authors have expounded on the virtues of clonidine as a premedicant for children. Nishina et al. stated that clonidine when used as a premedication in pediatric patients reliably produced sedation and anxiolysis.[1819] It has also been shown to provide excellent quality of separation from parents and blunting of the response to placement of the mask at the time of inhalational induction.[1520] Pretreatment with clonidine decreases the minimum alveolar concentration of the inhalational agents for induction, endotracheal intubation, and maintenance of anesthesia.[16192122] Additional perioperative advantages include attenuation of the reflex tachycardia and hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation and prevention of intraoperative hemodynamic instability and swings in hemodynamic parameters.[2223] Benefits beyond the intraoperative period include a decreased postoperative incidence of nausea, vomiting, shivering, and emergence delirium, as well as a reduction of postoperative requirements for opioids.[14171824–26] Unlike midazolam, clonidine does not accentuate opioid-induced respiratory depression.[27] In this issue of the Saudi Journal of Anaesthesia, Trevor et al. provide additional information comparing clonidine with the commonly used premedicant, oral midazolam.[28] The authors compared premedication with standard doses of oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and clonidine (4 μg/kg) in a cohort of 60 pediatric patients (ASA I–II) undergoing elective surgery. Their protocol demonstrates some of the challenges with oral premedication in the pediatric population as with both medications, some extra steps were necessary, including the use of honey to mask the flavor of midazolam as they used the standard intravenous preparation with benzyl alcohol and the need to compound the oral clonidine by crushing adult tablets of 0.1 mg. Additionally, one of the major drawbacks to clonidine use was noted as the authors administered clonidine 90 min prior to anesthetic induction given its slow onset of action. This practice is likely not feasible in many operating rooms given the timing of patient arrivals in the preoperative holding area and the rapidity of turnover of the operating rooms. Also of note was the fact that although clonidine effectively prevented separation anxiety (80% of those receiving clonidine vs only 30% with midazolam, neither drug was particularly effective during venipuncture for placement of an intravenous cannula (33.3% with clonidine vs 23.3% with midazolam) or during placement of the mask for anesthetic induction (26.6% with clonidine vs 20.0% with midazolam). However, the level of anxiolysis was judged to be better with midazolam than with clonidine at all 3 critical junctures (separation from parents, venipuncture, and mask application). Although statistically significant differences were noted in the blood pressure between the two groups with a lowering blood pressure with clonidine, no clinically significant hemodynamic effects were noted. The authors concluded that although clonidine was an excellent sedative with other beneficial effects, which have been outlined above, it is not a better anxiolytic alternative to midazolam. Given the results of this study, it is evident that we still need future studies to determine the optimal premedication or perhaps combination of premedicants for children. The current study demonstrates successful premedication in only approximately 1/3rd of the patients. This may be related to the long onset time of clonidine or the erratic absorption due to the administration of the intravenous preparation of midazolam in honey. More importantly, we have no information on the long-term behavioral outcomes of these patients or the amnestic effects of the premedicants. At least in the pediatric population, although effective and easy separation and tolerance of the mask is desirable, perhaps the goal should be to ensure amnesia for the perioperative process. The ideal preanesthetic medication should provide a quick onset, have short-lived effects while enabling easy separation of the child from the caregivers. Given the experience in the operating room and the issues noted in this editorial, the ideal premedicant has not been identified. Although frequently used, midazolam frequently falls short of the mark suggesting that novel agents or more appropriately, combinations of agents should be studied. Although the literature is replete with head-to-head comparisons of various agents, it seems that perhaps we should start studying combinations of agents. The α2-adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine, have many beneficial properties throughout the perioperative period, although the onset time of sedation is such that it is likely not the ideal agent by itself to provide ideal preoperative sedation. However, as noted above, there are numerous other benefits, such as decreasing the minimum alveolar concentration of the inhalational agents for induction, endotracheal intubation, and maintenance of anesthesia. Clonidine also attenuates the surgical stress response, blunts the hormonal response to surgery, and prevents intraoperative hemodynamic instability and swings in hemodynamic parameters. Benefits beyond the intraoperative period include a decreased postoperative incidence of nausea, vomiting, shivering, and emergence delirium as well as a reduction of postoperative requirements for opioids. These are provided without potentiating opioid-induced respiratory depression. These beneficial effects could be utilized if the undesirable properties of clonidine could be masked or covered with an additional agent. Ongoing work is currently evaluating the newest α2-adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, as a potential agent for premedication with its use by nonparenteral routes.[29–32] Although we are getting closer, we still believe that we have not found the ideal agent for premedication of children in the perioperative setting. It is likely that the question may not be which agent, but rather, which combination of agents.",

Attacks commonly occur on waking, a potentially helpful diagnostic clue. The amnesic attacks may be associated with persistent memory complaints. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical history, wake or sleep - deprived EEG (often repeated) and/or a clear - cut response to anticonvulsivant therapy. The pathophysiology remains poorly understood. It is uncertain whether recurrent episodes of amnesia represent ictal or post-ictal phenomena.",

      "abstract": "There are different forms of sleep apnea, each with different causes. Fortunately, they are all treatable. 1] Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the muscles and soft tissues in the upper airways relax and become blocked during sleep. It is often accompanied by loud snoring or snorting. OSA is the most common form of sleep apnea, 2] Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain stops sending signals to the respiratory muscles while sleeping. Although the airways remain open, breathing stops. CSA is less common than OSA, 3] Mixed sleep apnea is a combination of central and obstructive sleep apnea, and Common to all of these disorders is the occurrence of apneas and hypopneas. Apnea is when the muscles and soft tissues in the upper airways slacken and collapse to the point that they are completely blocked for 10 seconds or more. Hypopnea is a partial blockage of the airways that decreases airflow by more than 50% for 10 seconds or more.",

It can be seen in healthy children one year and older and is particularly common among preschool-aged children . Most individuals have bowel movements at regular intervals, and although the frequency varies from person to person, stools should pass without significant straining or discomfort. Functional constipation is often described as difficult or infrequent bowel movements/ deviation from normal frequency, painful defecation, the passage of hard stools, and/or sensation of incomplete evacuation of stool. It is often not caused by any underlying systemic cause or anatomical defect. It is usually multifactorial to include environmental conditions, stress, diet, coping skills, and social support.",

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behaviours are relatively rare and are not known to be associated with social phobias, with an intense scientific debate on going if it constitutes a behavioral addiction. Compulsive sexual behaviours otherwise known as Hypersexuality/problematic sexual behaviour and is identified by a persistent pattern of failure to control repetitive, intense urges, fantasies and behaviours of a sexual nature over an extended period of time that causes marked impairment in multiple areas of functioning, in this case, especially educational functioning. Phobic anxiety disorders also known as social phobias are a group of conditions in which anxiety is triggered typically in well-defined situations that are not currently dangerous with resulting avoidance of such situations. Nevertheless, CSB is not captured in DSM V and ICD10, although, diagnostic criteria were proposed during DSM V revision, it is not currently recognized in the DSMV. Although, CSB has been proposed for inclusion in ICD 11 as an impulse control disorder, rather than as a mental and behavioural disorder as previously debated, in addition, strict diagnostic guidelines were instituted due to concerns of over pathologizing sexual behaviours. This presents a diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the psychiatrist when a patient presents with symptoms of Compulsive sexual behaviours with or without anxiety, since there are presently no diagnostic and treatment guidelines. We present the case of a 23 year old 3rd year medical student with a 5 year history of compulsive masturbation, persistent pornography viewing, failure to resist impulses and fantasies with accompanying intense distress especially following periods of abstinence and a two year history of recurrent panic attacks in social settings in which women were triggers complicated by depressive symptoms, symptoms significantly impaired most areas of functioning particularly his academics.\r\n\r\n A diagnosis of Social Phobia/Social Anxiety disorder with episodic panic attacks and compulsive sexual behaviours and mild depressive episode was made because patient met criteria according to ICD 10 and proposed ICD 11. Mental state examination shows anxious mood, congruent with affect, depersonalization, derealization as well as anxious ruminations. Within a year, after commencement of an SSRI, Atenolol and Lisonopril and CBT all anxiety symptoms resolved with marked reduction in the frequency of pornography viewing as well as compulsive masturbation with associated fantasies. This case report lends voice to the on-going debate about the inclusion of compulsive sexual behaviours as a mental and behavioural disorder Dependence syndrome in diagnostic classification systems as well as the need for development of standardized appropriate treatment modalities. This case report will highlight Compulsive Sexual Behaviours, rationale for its inclusion as an addiction in classification systems and treatment approaches to the disorder.",

Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

Capgras syndrome was initially considered a purely psychotic disorder, but recently, Capgras syndrome understands as a neurological disorder, in which the delusion primarily results from organic brain lesions or degeneration. The case report aims to review previous literature on topic and present a case of pregnant woman experiencing Capgras delusion under full consciousness and whose expediencies are not linked to any psychiatric or neurological illness. Case presentation: A 29 year old, pregnant woman was brought for psychiatric consultation by her family with chief complaints of belief that her husband had been replaced by identical impostor, associated with irritability, anger and hostility since 4 months and aggravated in the last month. This pregnant woman showing absence of emotional response, no familiarity toward her husband and delusion that her husband replaced by imposter. Conclusion: Capgras syndrome is not necessarily pathological and can occur in a healthy population. Capgras syndrome may happen spontaneously under full consciousness in the healthy subjects; like in neurological and psychiatric patients. In this case report the phenomenological aspects of Capgras syndrome may similar in the content of the delusion to other studies were carried out with psychiatric or neurological patients, but no evidence of depersonalization, physical violence or aggression.",

The incidence is 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7) but it ranges from 1-8 and 25 out of every 1000 born in developed and developing countries, respectively. The most frequent causes are detachment of the placenta, prolapse of the umbilical cord and uterine rupture. The diagnostic criteria include partial or total incapacity for the newborn to cry and breath at birth even when stimulated, requiring assisted ventilation in the delivery room, Apgar < 5 in 5 and 10 minutes, acidemia (pH ≤ 7 and / or bases deficit ≥ 12 mmol/l), alterations of the conscience and the reflexes of Moro, grasping and suction, muscular stretching and muscle tone. The clinical forms are mild, moderate and severe. In the mild forms, the recovery is total in three days without, or with minimal, neurodevelopmental alterations. The moderate and severe forms cause permanent neurological deficits and neurodevelopmental alterations (48%) or death (27%). The regular or amplitude integrated EEG and the magnetic and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging performed between 24 and 96 hours and 7 and 21 days after birth, respectively, have a high diagnostic and prognostic value. Induced hypothermia (33.5° C for 72 hours) is recommended before 6 hours old. The result is a decrease in mortality (from 35% to 27%) and morbidity (from 48% to 27%).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: A subsequent headache within seven days of a head injury (or after regaining consciousness after the head trauma)is referred to as a post-traumatic headache (PTHA); it is referred to as chronic or chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTHA) if it lasts longer than three months after the injury. Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "abstract": "As effects of excitement may be noted—( a ) those which are transitory, occurring during the excitement, and (b) those which persist. As transitory effects there may be an apparently general hypermnesia, in which there is a marked freshening of all memories, or there may be a selective hypermnesia, where certain rather narrow lines of association are followed. The lasting effects may be hypermnesia, hypomnesia, or total amnesia for events experienced during the excitement. The following lasting effects may also be noted upon experiences that have occurred before the emotion: (1) The well-known retro-active amnesia; (2) The opposite, retro-active hypermnesia to which little attention has formerly been paid; (3) a combination of both these effects; for the same person the stretch preceding the critical event may show vivid recollections followed by a period of utter blank. The retro-active hypermnesia in the author's cases rarely goes beyond the events of the day preceding the excitement. It occurred in 25 out of 225 cases. The antecedent events are unusually vivid—more vivid than any other of the patients' memories. The vividness is not confined to visual images, although these are more frequent; sounds, the mood, the general state of the mind may be clearly represented. There is some indication that women experience it more frequently than men. In some cases the effect has come at some crisis at early childhood, in others at a later date. The quality of the emotion seems of less importance than the intensity of the shock. Fear, or fearless surprise, or pleasurable surprise may be the cause. If the intensity be exceeded the experiences connected with it are in some degree suppressed; while if it be not reached the experiences are lost probably by a mere failure to gather up the events into the mesh of interest. Emotion facilitates the recall of whatever is noticed during the excitement, and it seems probable that memory images may be treated by the emotional onrush in the same way as perceptive images. The experiences of the preceding day, however, probably do not exist as actual images at the time of the emotion but as psycho-physical dispositions or traces, so that where there is retro-active hypermnesia the emotion would seem to have the power to strengthen these dispositions and the connections by which they may be called into life. The author gives illustrative cases.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging in Epileptic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders, and affects about 50 million people around the world. It is a heterogeneous condition characterized by recurrent spontaneous epileptic seizures. There are no age, sex or race discriminations, although incidence of the first epileptic seizure has a bimodal distribution, with peaks in childhood and after 60 years of age (Engel & Pedley, 2008). According to their localization, epilepsies and epileptic seizures should be classified as focal (or partial) and generalized. Partial seizures begin in a restricted portion of cerebral cortex. Partial seizures are associated with a restricted area of the of the cerebral cortex and are clasified as either simple or complex, depending on the level of conscious awareness. Simple partial seizures are characterized by brief specific neurologic dysfunction, contingent upon the localization of the epileptogenic focus. By definition, they do not compromise consciousness during the event, and might manifest as motor signs (with a focus involving the primary motor area), sensitive symptoms (focus in the primary somatosensory area), autonomic or psychic signs (mesiobasal areas). Complex partial seizures affect the patient’s consciousness from the onset of the event. Both simple and complex partial seizures can propagate to the whole brain and become secondarily generalized seizures. Examples of primary generalized seizures are absence seizures, tonic-clonic generalized seizures, and myoclonic seizures. All those three seizure types are generated by epileptic discharges involving both cerebral hemispheres from their onset. By extension, focal epilepsies are characterized by recurrent spontaneous partial seizures, and generalized epilepsies have generalized seizures as their main seizure type. Epilepsies can be idiopathic (without an identifiable structural cause), symptomatic (due to a structural lesion), or cryptogenic (with a presumed lesion, not detectable by current available neuroimaging methods). Broadly, idiopathic epilepsies (partial or generalized) begin in the childhood years, have a good prognosis, and go into remission during adolescence. The symptomatic generalized epilepsies encompass a group of epileptic syndromes with very poor prognosis, characterized by extremely refractory seizures and accompanied by neurodevelopmental delay. The symptomatic partial epilepsies depict a large spectrum of epileptic disorders caused by several types of brain lesions. A significant percentage of patients who have seizures not responsive to antiepileptic drugs is affected by this type of epilepsy. Surgical treatment becomes a good therapeutic option for these patients, and the identification of the structural cortical lesion causing their epilepsies is primordial for a good postsurgical prognosis (Panaiyotopoulos, 2010).",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Ejaculatory dysfunction is a common complaint and is often associated with a reduced quality of life for sufferer and partner. The spectrum of ejaculatory dysfunction extends from premature ejaculation ( PE ) to delayed ejaculation ( DE ) and anejaculation. Over the past 20–30 years, the PE treatment paradigm, previously limited to behavioural psychotherapy, has expanded to include drug treatment. Multiple well‐controlled, evidence‐based studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors in delaying ejaculation, confirming their role as first‐line agents for the treatment of lifelong and acquired PE . More recently, there has been increased attention to the psychosocial consequences of PE , its epidemiology, its aetiology and its pathophysiology by both clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry. DE and anejaculation are probably the least common, least studied and least understood of the male sexual dysfunctions. However, their impact is significant as they may result in a lack of sexual fulfilment for both the man and his partner, an effect further compounded when procreation is among the couple's goals of sexual intercourse. The causes of DE , anejaculation and anorgasmia are manifold. Numerous psychotherapeutic treatments are described for the management of delayed or anejaculation. Although some appear to be effective, none has been properly evaluated in large‐scale samples. Treatment of DE or anejaculation with pharmacotherapy has met with limited success. No drugs have been approved by regulatory agencies for this purpose, and most drugs that have been identified for potential use have limited efficacy, impart significant side‐effects or are yet considered experimental in nature.",

      "title": "Prescribing for depressed adolescents: Office decision-making in the face of limited research evidence",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a relatively common, disabling, potentially life-threatening medical condition.1 MDD is diagnosed when there are five or more symptoms occurring over 2 or more weeks.2 Adult and adolescent symptoms of MDD are almost the same. However, irritable mood and lack of weight gain can qualify as depressive symptoms in adolescents.2 The lifetime prevalence of unipolar depression (MDD or dysthymic disorder) in adolescence is 11.7%; three-quarters of this percentage suffer severe impairment.3 Adolescent MDD has very high levels of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders.4 Depression is the condition most commonly implicated in adolescent and adult suicide.5 Adolescent depression runs a remitting and relapsing course, often recurring later in adolescence or adulthood6, 7 (see Fig. 1). Of those adolescents who recover from their depression, about 50% will have another depressive episode in the next 5 years.6, 8 In summary, adolescent MDD is a serious and sometimes chronic medical condition that requires assertive treatment. Course of adolescent major depression. *No depressive symptoms for over 2 months. A number of antidepressants have come onto the market since 1987 that provide fewer side effects at therapeutic dose and in overdose than the older tricyclic antidepressants.9, 10 These newer agents include the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram), the serotonin–norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine). The prescribing of antidepressants to children and adolescents has increased from 1996 to 2007.11 Overall, 19% of Australian paediatricians and 68% of child psychiatrists self-report prescribing SSRIs.12 However, this is very unlikely to be specifically for major depression, as paediatricians prescribe across a broad variety of diagnoses and at times for off-label conditions. The SSRIs are a class of antidepressant that have a high affinity for blocking the presynaptic serotonin transport proteins but not the other monoamine transmembrane transport proteins.13 SSRIs differ in their effects through secondary binding to non-serotonergic receptors,14 the antidepressant effects of their metabolites, their excretion half-lives and their effect on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.15 Despite their differences, the available SSRIs are all effective treatments for moderate adult depression16 and display similar overall side effect profiles.15 In 2004, evidence emerged from antidepressant trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies that there was an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviours in children and adolescents given antidepressants. In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered that pharmaceutical companies add a ‘black box’ warning on all antidepressant medication warning of the heightened risk of suicidality.17 There have been several key guidelines, meta-analyses and papers published since the FDA black box warning that have added further information in an attempt to clarify the role of antidepressants in the treatment of depressed adolescents. Despite the increasing amount of information available, it is our contention that the available literature remains limited and at times contradictory about prescribing. A selective review of the key papers is provided with a discussion on the implication for practice-based management of depressed adolescents. The association of antidepressants and suicidal behaviour in adolescents is discussed elsewhere.18 Do antidepressant drugs work at all in adolescent depression? There is universal agreement that tricyclic antidepressants have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. A Cochrane meta-analysis found that there was no difference in the rate of recovery in children and adolescents with depressive disorder between those given tricyclic antidepressants and those given placebo treatments.19 The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English peer-reviewed journals for the treatment of adolescent or combined adolescent/child depression (n = 14) are shown in Table 1. The majority of the studies were industry-funded and were conducted in North America. Unpublished and non-English-language studies on nefazodone, citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine and mirtazapine have been noted elsewhere.34-37 Fluoxetine is the drug with the most consistent positive response, in three out of the four studies. On the basis of evidence of efficacy from RCTs, the FDA has approved both fluoxetine, in 2003,38 and escitalopram (the active enantiomer of citalopram), in 2009, for use in adolescent depression.39 While seven studies show superiority of drug over placebo, the reported findings from some of the studies have been queried since publication. A study of sertraline by Wagner et al. (2003) that reported positive results had in fact pooled two studies with the same methodology.25 When each of the sertraline studies is taken on its own there is no significance in either study.18 Jureidini (2008) noted that the significant difference between paroxetine and placebo reported by Keller et al. (2001) was found using measures not cited in the original protocol (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression depressed mood item, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia – Lifetime depressed mood item, Clinical Global Impression).40 It is possible that the outcomes reported from each of the RCTs may be influenced by the variables related to the study design, medication compliance, placebo response rate and the nature of the cohort recruited.37, 41-43 The differences between the studies restrict direct comparison of their reported findings. The limitations of single RCTs point us to systematic reviews with meta-analyses that have the capacity to pool data and address the problem of small sample sizes.44 An early meta-analysis (n = 5 RCTs) reported a small effect size for antidepressants over placebo, with suggested negligible clinical benefit.45 Tsapakis et al. (n = 29 RCTs including tricyclics) reported an overall number needed to treat (NNT) of 9, with a higher response rate in adolescents compared with children.46 Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry (n = 12 RCTs)47 and Whittington et al. (n = 5 RCTs)48 reported a modest benefit for fluoxetine over placebo. In summary, these meta-analyses found small effect sizes that have been interpreted as reflecting limited to negligible clinical improvement. The most recent Cochrane review (n = 19 RCTs) of 3335 participants treated with newer antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, mirtazapine, venlafaxine)35 found a small statistically significant difference in response/remission favouring antidepressants over placebo, but this finding was qualified as being not clinically meaningful.35 Other authors came to different conclusions. Bridge et al. (n = 15 RCTs) found in their meta-analysis that the NNT for antidepressants in children and adolescent MDD was 10 but advocated for ‘the cautious and well monitored’ use of antidepressants.37 Other techniques have been used to assess antidepressant efficacy. Gibbons et al. (2012) pooled all the data from each participant in the fluoxetine RCT studies (n = 708) over the first 6 weeks of treatment, arguing this approach was superior to a meta-analysis as it utilised all the data available.49 Gibbons et al. found that using fluoxetine compared with placebo, the NNT for response to treatment was 4.49 Higher response and remission rates were reported for fluoxetine in depressed youth than adults.49 The overall findings suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine and less evidence for that of other antidepressants in the short term. The various complex analyses, in the main, have been confusing, as different authors have argued for exclusion of selected RCTs from analysis depending on their orientation.46, 50, 51 Further, meta-analysis itself is not an exact science and is open to some interpretation depending on which studies are included, the quality of the studies and the nature of the statistical analysis (fixed-effects vs. random-effects regression).37, 52 Some studies that have compared combined cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication treatments to monotherapeutic approaches for adolescent depression have shown differences in the relative efficacy of CBT, antidepressants or combination after 3 months.31, 53 However, there is convergence in efficacy across all the treatments (medication vs. CBT vs. combination) in the subsequent months53, 54 and years.8 In a meta-analysis of five RCTs, antidepressants (predominantly fluoxetine) have been shown to be equivalent to a combination of antidepressant and CBT at 26 and 36 weeks' follow-up.55 These findings challenge the assumption that two treatments are ultimately better than one. In contrast, for adolescents with MDD who do not respond to the initial SSRI, changing to another antidepressant (SSRI or venlafaxine), especially in conjunction with CBT, has been shown to result in an improvement in depressive symptoms in half of patients.56 In this treatment-resistant group the change to a combination of CBT and antidepressant or another antidepressant led to 38.9% achieving remission at 24 weeks.57 RCTs of antidepressant efficacy have typically aimed to examine short-term outcome (2 to 3 months). Adolescent depressive disorder runs a relapsing, remitting course into early adulthood.6 There have been two placebo-controlled studies of children and adolescents with MDD looking at relapse prevention.58, 59 Over 32 weeks' (n = 40) and 6 months' (n = 102) follow-up of patients who remitted from MDD, fewer patients relapsed on fluoxetine than placebo, and those on placebo relapsed more quickly than those on fluoxetine,58, 59 providing preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of fluoxetine in reducing risk of MDD relapse. Kennard et al. conducted a pilot study of adolescents with MDD (n = 46) who had responded to fluoxetine, randomising them to CBT and fluoxetine or fluoxetine only over the next 6 months.60 Those adolescents who were given CBT and fluoxetine were eight times less likely to relapse than those who received medication alone.60 There is early evidence that in the continuation phase of treatment (6 to 12 months after the acute phase), there is a role for antidepressant and possibly CBT prophylaxis to prevent relapse. Depression in children and adolescents is associated with parental depression.61 This association is likely to be mediated by genetic susceptibility; exposure to parental depressive emotions, cognitions and behaviours; and increased familial stresses. Intervention studies to treat depressed parents have largely focused on maternal depression.62 For depressed adolescents whose mothers are concurrently depressed, treating the mother's depression has been shown to improve internalising disorders in their offspring.63 This improvement continues at 12-month follow-up.64 These studies, taken together, point to the importance of looking at the whole family system and not just treating the adolescent in isolation. There are several clinical practice guidelines that incorporate these research findings and expert opinion to assist paediatricians in the management of the depressed adolescent. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care treatment (GLAD-PC) were published in 2007,65 the beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines were released in 2010,66 and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines were released in 200567 and updated in 2011 without change. The NICE guidelines recommend that children and adolescents with moderate to severe depression should be offered, as first-line treatment, CBT, interpersonal therapy or short-term family therapy of at least 3 months' duration. Antidepressants should only be prescribed if the adolescent has moderate to severe depression, is assessed by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services tier 2 or 3 professional and is receiving concurrent psychological treatment. The beyondblue guidelines recommend that fluoxetine should be considered for reduction of depressive symptoms in the short term where psychological treatment has failed, is inaccessible or is refused.66 The GLAD-PC guidelines recommend using an SSRI for moderate to severe depression, outlining dosing regiments for six different SSRIs.65 The NICE guidelines appear to be the most conservative in their recommendations and the GLAD-PC the most liberal. The recommendation for the use of antidepressants in the short term by the beyondblue guidelines is in line with the evidence base, which, in the main, has investigated short-term outcomes of depression. A number of factors limit the clinician's ability to apply RCT findings in his or her practice.68 The RCTs described use placebos, are short-term and are not representative of those depressed adolescents who present in the clinician's office. Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry reported that the children and adolescents in RCTs were unlike those who presented for treatment, who were suffering with lower levels of comorbidity and suicidality.47 The paediatrician often sees patients who would be excluded from most of the adolescent depression RCTs. For instance, there is scant information about the assessment of use of antidepressants in those with MDD and developmental disability,69 leaving them therapeutic orphans. Further, the clinician does not have the option of using a placebo. If the likelihood of a short-term response is 61% on an antidepressant,37 where does that leave the prescribing clinician? It is very likely that many clinicians will consider trialling an SSRI. Seligman (1998) has made the point that the aims of clinical trials overlap with those of the practicing clinician, but they are not the same thing. Seligman notes that clinical trials are largely short-term, single-intervention studies, usually focusing on a single outcome (e.g. reduction in depressive symptoms).70 By contrast, clinical work is, in the main, a long-term engagement, involving multiple treatments that are self-correcting.70 The decision to medicate, while guided by the available research, is also directed by the adolescent's severity of symptoms, unique strengths and vulnerabilities, family factors, access to mental health services and individual wishes of the patient and his or her parents. The paediatrician is well placed to integrate all these factors. The treatment guidelines for adolescent depression suggest that the role of antidepressants is as a second-line treatment for moderate to severe depression as part of stepped treatment where there has been inadequate response to psychological therapies. Of the antidepressants, fluoxetine has the strongest evidence of efficacy; however, the evidence is largely short-term. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that fluoxetine can prevent relapse. Tricyclics have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. CBT may be added to an antidepressant; however, evidence of an additive effect is limited. Effectiveness studies are largely unavailable, and treatment response rates may vary in clinical practice. If an adolescent and his or her mother are both depressed, then both are likely to benefit if the mother is the one who takes and responds to an antidepressant.",

      "title": "Carersʼ experiences of seeking help for relatives with first-episode psychosis: a systematic review of qualitative evidence.",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to synthesize the best available evidence on the lived experience of carers of a relative with a first-episode psychosis (FEP) and in particular their experience preceding and of seeking help. More specifically, the objectives are to explore: Perceived promoters and inhibitors to help-seeking during a FEP. Perceived barriers and facilitators to accessing services during a FEP. Background Psychotic disorders are low prevalence disorders, affecting between 1-2% of the adult population.1 Onset of first-episode psychosis (FEP), the first presentation of psychotic symptoms, is typically during late adolescent and early adult years.1, 2 Positive psychotic symptoms may include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and behaviour.3, 4 Onset may be sudden or insidious, though most individuals experience a prodromal phase manifested by the gradual development of a variety of signs and symptoms that are commonly vague and nonspecific e.g. functional and social decline, sleep disturbance and mood symptoms.4-6 Individuals detected in this phase are considered to be ‘ultra high risk’ clinically, though development of psychosis is not inevitable.7 Though low in prevalence, psychotic disorders account for a high proportion of resources allocated to mental health services and are associated with significant challenges for those with the illness as well as their families.1, 2 During late adolescent and early adult years a young person is developing in many areas including formation of friendships, vocational goals, and general independence.2 The experience of mental illness during these formative years can divert a person from the trajectory of normal life development and significantly disrupt the person's life goals.8, 9 For those presenting at a later stage in life, other developmental issues will be of importance such as partners and children.10 A recent Australian national survey of people living with a psychotic illness, designed to capture the impact of psychosis, concluded that ‘psychosis is associated with substantial and persistent disability’.2(p.97) More specifically, participants named the following challenges: financial difficulties (42.7%), loneliness (37.2%), unemployment (35.1%), poor physical health (27.4%) uncontrolled symptoms of mental illness (25.7%), lack of stable/suitable housing (18.1%) and stigma (11.6%).2 Whilst some people will experience one psychotic episode and obtain full recovery, a significant number (61.5%) reported recurrent episodes with good or partial recovery during episodes and 30.5% experienced a continuous chronic illness.2 Early intervention for FEP has been a focus of care for several decades. It arose from the premise that the early years of illness are a ‘critical period’ for intervention when there can be significant decline but also most scope for influencing longer term prognosis.9, 11, 12 The main aims of such services are to shorten the course of the initial psychotic episode, reduce the severity of the illness, and subsequently minimize disruption to the person's life.9, 12 Key components of early intervention include medication to reduce symptoms and psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting the individual's recovery.13 Even after onset of psychosis there is typically a delay in accessing appropriate treatment.14 The period of time between onset of first psychotic symptom and first treatment, referred to as the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), has been a major focus of research and intervention. This is because DUP is considered to be an important and malleable prognostic factor. A systematic review to establish whether DUP is associated with prognosis included a meta-analysis of 26 studies from diverse cultural backgrounds including 4490 participants.15 The results showed there is evidence of a moderate association between DUP and symptomatic and functional outcome in the short term (6-12 month follow up), though it remains inconclusive as to whether reducing a person's DUP improves overall prognosis. Mean DUP was found to be two years.15 The Treatment and Intervention in Psychosis (TIPS) early detection and intervention programme in Norway successfully reduced median DUP from 16 to 5 weeks.16 At ten-year follow up, though reported symptoms were comparable across the early detection group and usual detection group, there were significant gains in recovery for the early detection group due to increased employment.17 Reducing DUP remains a common service goal.13 DUP is typically long, meaning individuals18 and their families19-21 are often required to cope with distressing symptoms for many months or longer. Many individuals and families report high levels of distress during the stage of untreated psychosis. First-episode psychosis is a high-risk period for suicidality22 which is important as previous suicide attempts are predictors of later attempts and completed suicide.23 Gersen et al24 found that families of relatives with a FEP predominantly use adaptive coping strategies. In contrast, families of individuals with a more chronic illness reportedly use increased maladaptive strategies, suggesting the impact of burden and stress of care over time on coping.24, 25 A recent systematic review measuring the effectiveness of early intervention on clinical outcome was inconclusive, with the exception of sustained positive impact in the areas of employment and family.26 Whilst this may have implications for future funding directives, it does not reduce the need for individuals with a FEP to receive early and appropriate intervention. Minimising the impact of psychosis for individuals and improving outcome remains a priority in Clinical Practice Guidelines in many countries.3, 27, 28 Quick and timely access to services can positively impact on the distress experienced by both the ill person and their families. Reaching those individuals experiencing a FEP during the early stages of illness requires ‘early detection of psychosis in the community and understanding factors associated with and contributing to delay in help-seeking’.14(p.76) The literature related to pathways to care explores barriers and facilitators to accessing services. This encompasses help-seeking behaviour, accessibility of services and service response.9, 29, 30 Help-seeking can be defined as ‘“the behaviour of actively seeking help from other people” (Rickwood, Deane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005, p. 4)31 and can be directed towards formal sources, such as mental health professionals, or informal sources, such as family and friends’ (Dr Coralie Wilson, personal communication, 2012 Mar 27). For young people informal sources are the preferred source of help.31, 32 In FEP it is frequently family members that initiate successful contacts for their relatives20, 33 and often without the affected individual participating in the contact.34 Before help-seeking can occur there needs to be a recognition that the person is in need of help.32 Recognition that a disorder is developing, knowledge of treatment options and knowledge of effective help-seeking strategies are all components of ‘mental health literacy’.32 Community surveys of mental health literacy show that many people are unable to recognize mental illness, though there is evidence that improvements can be made by education strategies at a community level.16, 32 This knowledge is now impacting upon policy development, with programmes designed to develop people's mental health literacy and help-seeking skills.16, 27, 32, 35 In a systematic review aiming to understand and measure pathways to care in FEP, Singh14 notes that there remains a delay for relatives to seek help even when a problem has become evident. Understanding individuals' personal narratives and journeys is one method of enhancing understanding of the processes that affect help-seeking.14 Delays in accessing appropriate treatment arise at all levels including illness recognition, help-seeking and service response. Help-seeking is just one factor that can impact on delay to treatment.36 Delays at service level can also be significant and for varied reasons, e.g. lack of affordable services, inflexibility of appointments37 and delayed diagnosis within mental health services.38 Common themes relating to delayed help-seeking include: stigma, misattribution of symptoms (e.g. drugs, stress or typical changes of adolescence), not knowing where to go, hope that the symptoms will go away without intervention, and a raised threshold for seeking help.5, 39, 40 Factors associated with successful help-seeking include: frank psychotic symptoms, depression and suicidal thinking and reaching a crisis.5, 18, 20 When studies include both individuals and families of FEP, considerable congruence is reported in themes and experiences when help-seeking.18, 21 Research to date provides information regarding potential barriers and facilitators to help-seeking in a FEP. Increased awareness of the impact of prolonged DUP and benefits of early intervention has driven the need to further explore and understand the pathways to care for people experiencing a FEP. A preliminary search of the literature reveals qualitative studies exploring individuals' and their carers' experiences of help-seeking during a FEP.5, 21, 41 Carers play a crucial role in accessing help for relatives14, 21, often being the primary and sole help-seeker.34 A search of the Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute Library of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, CINAHL and PROSPERO databases did not reveal any previous or planned systematic reviews of qualitative evidence on this topic. A synthesis of the relevant studies of carers' experiences will add to the understanding of illness recognition, help-seeking strategies utilized and service response and may provide important information regarding pathways to care for those experiencing a FEP. Definition of terms First-episode psychosis (FEP) For the purpose of this review all operational definitions of FEP will be considered. This means first-episode may be defined as first treatment contact, duration of antipsychotic medication use or duration of psychosis.42 Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include carers of a relative with a FEP. This means first presentation of psychotic symptoms with no limit to duration of untreated psychosis. Method of diagnosis may be according to any of the editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), research diagnostic criteria relevant to the country of study or confirmed by a psychiatrist or other health care professional. Psychotic symptoms may include hallucinations and delusions. Psychotic disorders may include: Schizophrenia Schizoaffective disorders Mania with psychotic symptoms Depression with psychotic symptoms Delusional disorders Acute and transient psychotic disorders Other and unspecified non-organic psychotic disorder. There will be no age restriction for the person experiencing the psychosis. Carers could be a parent, sibling, spouse or other relative of any age. Studies that predominantly include individuals in the prepsychotic or ultra high-risk stage of illness will be excluded due to the ‘low’ conversion rate to psychosis. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that investigate the experience of carers of a relative with a first-episode psychosis, and in particular their experience preceding and of seeking help from both informal (family and friends) and formal (services) sources. Types of outcomes The review will consider research conducted in any mental health care setting including inpatient, outpatient and community. Types of studies This review will consider studies that focus on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. In the absence of research studies, other text such as opinion papers and reports will be considered. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Studies published in English will be considered for inclusion in this review. Studies published between January 1990 and August 2012 will be considered for inclusion in this review. This is due to focus of care on first-episode psychosis and pathways to care developing in the early 1990's. The databases to be searched include: CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and Embase. The search for unpublished studies will include: Mednar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Trove, relevant professional bodies in the field of Early Intervention in Psychosis and carers in mental health. Initial keywords to be used will be: help-seeking; care-givers; first-episode psychosis; qualitative. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Data will be extracted from qualitative research papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-QARI (Appendix I). The data extracted will include specific details about the phenomena of interest, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Qualitative research findings will, where possible, be pooled using JBI-QARI. This will involve the aggregation or synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation, through assembling the findings rated according to their quality, and categorising these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning. These categories are then subjected to a meta-synthesis in order to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesized findings that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Where textual pooling is not possible, the findings will be presented in narrative form. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.

Of these 60–70 per cent will be controlled on medication or enter into spontaneous remission, however the remainder will continue to have seizures despite the range of treatment available. There will be associated comorbidity of learning and behaviour difficulties in a significant proportion, and these may take precedence in management over the seizures themselves. Careful evaluation of each individual child with regard to the possible diagnosis and associated comorbidities is required in all children presenting with recurrent paroxysmal episodes in order to optimize management.",

The disease is responsible for migraine with aura at onset, for transient ischemic attacks and stroke during mid-adulthood, and can lead progressively to dementia. The neuropsychiatric manifestations of CADASIL include mood and behavior disturbances and various degrees of cognitive impairment. They are observed at all stages of the disorder. Episodes of mood disturbances (depression, manic episodes) are reported in 10–20 % of patients during the course of the disease; they are usually observed after the first ischemic events. Apathy is detected in more than one-third of patients several years after onset and alters the quality of life of patients. A marked decline of cognitive performances is detected in the vast majority of subjects with aging, particularly after age 50 years. However, executive dysfunction can be detected earlier, even after the third decade using dedicated cognitive tests. Dementia occurs after 60 years, usually after repeated ischemic event, and is nearly constant at the end stage of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Positional asphyxia is a type of asphyxia where the position of an individual compromises the ability to breathe. It is commonly caused by accidents due to alcohol or drug intoxication, diseases, and/or being in a confined space. In this study, the authors reviewed autopsy cases at their institute over the past 5 years where positional asphyxia is suspected as a contributing factor or cause of death. The autopsy cases (n=24) were divided into three groups: positional asphyxia was the cause of death (n=15); unknown cause of death but positional asphyxia was considered (n=4); and positional asphyxia was suspected to be a contributing factor (n=5). All cases of group A included postures that could interfere with breathing, but the typical jackknife or head-down postures were seen in approximately half of the cases; “classic signs of asphyxia” were also observed in approximately half of the cases. They shared features such as high blood alcohol concentration, therapeutic levels of drugs, various disease, minor head trauma, and morbid obesity; however, no definite diagnostic criteria have been established for forensic practice. Positional asphyxia is a form of mechanical asphyxia which must be differentiated from traumatic asphyxia. In addition to a complete autopsy, thorough laboratory tests and understanding of the circumstances of the case and the situation at the death scene are required for diagnosis. Special attention is required for the diagnosis of special types of positional asphyxia such as death during institutional restraint or prone restraint.",

      "title": "Hypochondriasis (Health Anxiety) Reformulated: Similarities With Generalized Anxiety Disorder in A Routine Setting Single Case",
      "abstract": "Despite its long documented history, Hypochondriasis remains a ubiquitous enigma to virtually all health care disciplines and providers. Because such highly health anxious patients are not commonly open to psychological (i.e., non-medical) interpretations of their physiological symptoms, sufferers ironically often become fixed on a pathological quest for physical and/or medical explanations for their problems. This pervasive worry and worry-based behavioral pattern perpetuates and reifies the belief that one hasor will developa serious medical condition, and, due to its inappropriate fixity on perceived organic (versus psychic) etiology, leaves such excessive doubt largely untreated. Therefore, continual high medical utilization and costs persist, and profound human suffering goes largely unchecked and unmanaged. Collectively, this sad, but very real condition and circumstance is unacceptable. Fortunately, this oft recalcitrant and thorny phenomenon has recently been construed as perhaps being similar to another such condition, namely Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If this resemblance is more than a surface relationship, and the two phenomena are indeed related on a process level (i.e., the two share a common pathological core), then Hypochondriasis should be treatable via a specifically tailored treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Since Generalized Anxiety Disorder has been far more responsive to intervention than Hypochondriasis, as its central mechanism of pathology is now well understood (i.e., intolerance for uncertainty), it would be conceivable that Hypochondriasis is in actuality far more treatable than its current riddle-status would otherwise suggest. Indeed, if the two prove to be quite similar, if not outright forms of one another, then there would be far more hope that patients who suffer with this can be helped. This stirring hypothesis was tested by treating a particularly refractory, chronic and severe case of Hypochondriasis with a specialized Generalized Anxiety Disorder treatment package. “Joe” responded quite favorably to treatment, and obtained meaningful change according to Jacobson and Truax’s (1991) method for determining clinically significantand reliablechange. In fact, according to their most restrictive standard, Joe could be labeled “Recovered” at the end of treatment, and at all 18-month follow-up points. His response, caveated around single case generalizability limitations, suggested that perhaps Hypochondriasis does indeed share a common etiological source, namely intolerance for uncertainty, with Generalized Anxiety Disorder; if so, then that would be highly explanative of the strong results. Recommendations are given for conceptualizing pathological forms of health-related fears as just that, a concrete form of an anxiety disorder rather than a Somatoform condition.

It can be a personality tendency, an emotional state, or a syndrome; clinical anxiety occurs when the feeling becomes more severe, persistent or pervasive than normal. Work factors are important in producing anxiety especially when they interact with home, marital or leisure problems. Anxiety can be assessed by interview, formal rating scales, measurement of physiological and endocrine variables such as heart rate and adrenaline excretion. Anxiety is the commonest of milder psychiatric conditions and may present in many ways which the clinician should aim to detect.",

      "abstract": "1. Infantile convulsions do not occur in a group of unselected cases more frequently than once in every 10 to 14 cases. 2. There seems to be no prognostic value to the pathological, physiological or psychological factors with which the first convulsion is associated. 3. Those cases where the convulsions occur without any apparent exciting factor (that is without trauma, teething, gastro-intestinal upsets, etc.) are invariably more significant and the prognosis should be more guarded than those cases where the convulsion is associated with some definite etiology. 4. In a fairly large group of cases, the convulsion is but a symptom of an unstable nervous system, one that is unable to withstand the ordinary vicissitudes to which the normal child is subjected. 5. There is undoubtedly a fairly large group of convulsive disorders in childhood where the convulsions are symptoms of an undiagnosed meningitis or encephalitis, which leaves behind irreparable damage to the nervous system. 6. The convulsion itself, though not associated with any devastating disease, such as meningitis, or encephalitis, may produce damage from which the brain never recovers, as seen in: (a) Some of the spastic conditions which follow immediately upon a series of convulsions. (b) Those cases following convulsions without neurological signs, but which have to adjust on a very much lower mental level. 7. The convulsions associated with rickets and tetany may leave behind very definite damage to the nervous system. 8. There is reason to believe that if the infantile convulsions associated with rickets, gastro-intestinal upsets, and acute infections were looked upon more seriously, and a greater effort made to prevent their occurrence during early life, much epilepsy and mental deficiency might be prevented.",

      "title": "[Perception of chronic pelvic pain in women: predictors and clinical implications].",
      "abstract": "Pain is a complex subjective experience, associated with neurovegetative, affective and cognitive rapid changes. Biological, psychosocial and contextual factors may contribute. Chronic inflammation, of whatever cause, is the leading contributor to chronic pain. The mast cell directs both the inflammatory process and the shift to chronic pain, mediating through the production of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and other neurotrophic molecules. Women, in the fertile age, are biologically more vulnerable to chronic inflammation, as fluctuations of estrogens are agonist factors of mast cells degranulation, mostly in the premenstrual phase. Pain is defined as \"nociceptive\" when it indicates an ongoing damage; \"neuropathic\" when it becomes a disease per se. Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) indicates an invalidating, persistent or recurrent pelvic pain, persisting for more than 6 months. CPP is the main complaint of 10-15% of gynaecologic consultations, leading to 40% of diagnostic laparoscopies and 15% of hysterectomies. Comorbidity, i.e. the coexistence of pathologies and painful syndromes in different pelvic organs, is another common feature. Cystitis, vulvar vestibulitis, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome all play an important role and contribute to identifying the hyperactive mast cell and related chronic inflammation as the common pathophysiologic factor. The paper reviews nociception characteristics, the emerging role of mast cells, the pathophysiology of comorbidity, biological, psychosexual and contextual predictors, and stresses the need to move from a \"hyperspecialistic\" perspective to a multisystemic reading of CPP, with special attention to the urologic perspective.",

      "title": "[Impotence].",
      "abstract": "\"Impotence\" is a vague term for a variety of sexual dysfunctions in the male, such as libido disturbance, erectile impotence, dyspareunia and a number of ejaculatory problems. They are very rarely caused and maintained by any single factor. Usually a combination of organic and psychic factors is involved; the symptoms may give some indication as to what factors are dominant. Organic and surgical treatment should be considered cautiously and should have a clear indication. Frequent psychic causes are partnership or personality problems and the so-called vicious circle of performance anxiety. Sexual counselling is often all the therapy needed, especially when sexual knowledge is inadequate or when relative trivial partnership problems are involved. The kind of psychotherapy offered depends on the main problem: partner therapy, therapy directed at the control of personality problems, or therapy based on the Masters and Johnson method may be indicated.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are disorders involving partial arousal from deep, non–rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in which individuals simultaneously display characteristics of both sleep and wakefulness. Sleepwalking represents the milder form of arousal, while night terrors are distinguished by the intense physiological experiences associated with alarm: screaming, pounding heart, rapid breathing, sweating, extreme terror or panic, and possibly frenzied motor activity. Both sleepwalking and night terrors usually occur during the first 3 hours after falling asleep but may occur at any time of night. They arise from non-REM sleep, generally sleep stages 3 or 4. There may be physical signs of traumatic injuries sustained during episodes of sleepwalking or night terrors. Most patients with sleepwalking/night terrors have a childhood history and/or a family history of these behaviors. There may also be a history of bedwetting.",

It is the clinical expression for a group of symptoms, the result of failure of important functions of the body, as those of circulation, respiration, excretion and secretion, and general metabolism. A lowered bodily temperature is a more or less constant phenomenon. Shock is intimately connected with the nervous mechanism. In studying shock from anesthesia it is not only essential to consider the specific toxin of the anesthetic used, but the resulting toxic bodies generated through the immediate or more remote influence of general anesthesia. Shock can not, therefore, be expressed in a single definition. The phenomena of shock are so complex that in experimental work on animals it is necessary to study each condition separately, and compile the associated facts obtained and compare",

Uma vez que a vulnerabilidade é agravada por eventos naturais somados a predisposição psicossocial e psicológica. A depressão trata-se de uma perturbação afetiva que culmina com um estado melancólico, mais que pode evoluir com alguns episódios de ansiedade que compartilha algumas características coma tristeza. As causas da maior parte das doenças de ordem psicológica não estão bem esclarecidas.

Quando surge imediatamente após o parto toma a designação de Depressão Pós-Parto. O estudo tem como objetivo Conhecer os fatores desencadeantes da Depressão Pós-Parto em gestantes no terceiro trimestre e puérperas do 1° ao 3° mês no PSF da cidade do Crato-Ce. Identificar os principais fatores de risco relacionados ao desenvolvimento da Depressão Pós-Parto. A pesquisa e do tipo exploratório-descritivo, com abordagem qualitativa. A população constituiu-se por gestantes no terceiro trimestre de gestação e puérperas de qualquer idade obedecendo aos seguintes critérios de inclusão e exclusão. Para a obtenção de dados junto à amostra, utilizou-se uma entrevista semi-estruturada contendo perguntas abertas e fechadas. Concluímos que se faz necessário um planejamento das equipes para a execução de ações preventivas que proporcionem uma gestação e um puerpério emocionalmente sadios. Essas equipes devem atuar, fundamentalmente, no acompanhamento das mães puérperas atendendo às suas necessidades básicas de saúde e educação, bem como na orientação daquilo que se refere aos cuidados com a criança. Tais atitudes básicas não devem ser específicas da medicina em geral ou da psiquiatria em particular. Elas devem ser realizadas por equipes multiprofissionais da rede básica de saúde treinada para isso.",

      "abstract": "Thirty-five EEG patterns of grand mal seizures recorded under some conditions such as awake-rest, sleep activation, beme-gride activation and intermittent photic stimulation were studied in 31 epileptics and four non-epileptics. Preictal EEG's were generally variable in comparison with ictal EEG's. It was not till 10 sec before seizures that the incidence of seizure discharges changed in most all cases, of which six increased and four decreased. A paroxysmal extreme varied EEG abnormality often continued for several to several ten sec immediately before a tonic phase, associated with some clinical symptoms. EEG patterns of the “preconvulsive phase” were divided into six types with different clinical features. In most all cases of bamegride activation, poly-spike and wave discharges preceded on seizure activities and some of them related with absence or psychomotor epilepsies. In all cases of sleep activation and photic stimulation, high voltage slow bursts or poly spikes preceded. Seizure patterns recorded at awake-rest were indefinite. A few cases didn't show any preconvulsive EEG changes, and were closely related with grand mal epilepsies. While the grand mal seizure during sleep had a long tonic-clonic convulsive phase and a short pre- and postconvulsive phase, that induced by bemegride activation showed the opposite findings. The grand mal seizure at awake-rest had the middle tendency between the two. The differences among the effects of various recording conditions on seizure patterns present some suggestions as to the patho-physiological mechanism of epileptic seizures.",

Nonrepetitive generalized slow-wave complexes during wakefulness appeared later and persisted 3 weeks after onset of clinical manifestations. SSPE repetitive complexes were observed 1 month later.

      "title": "PROGNOSTIC CRITERIA IN SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "On the basis of a critical survey of the literature, the following conclusions are drawn concerning the significance of the various criteria of prognosis in schizophrenia: The prognosis is most favorable when the duration of illness is short; the type of onset acute; exogenic precipitating factors, obvious; the element of confusion and the presence of atypical symptoms (especially manic-depressive symptoms), prominent in the early symptomatology; and when process symptoms are minimal or absent. Conversely, when these conditions are reversed, the prognosis is least favorable. This group of criteria is of the greatest import in the assessment of prognosis in schizophrenia. Certain other factors seem to have some significance, although their relative prognostic importance cannot be clearly evaluated at the present time. Patients with a history of a previous episode of illness appear to have a better chance of remission; the more so, the longer the interval of time between attacks, the more complete the recovery during the preceding remission, and the greater the dissimilarity between the present and previous episodes. The incidence of manic-depressive psychoses in the hereditary background may be related to the development of atypical symptoms and thus favorably influence the outcome of the illness. From a prognostic point of view, asthenic body type is unfavorable, pyknic favorable; due to possible technical error, caution is required in classification of body-type. Extravert temperament and adequate pre-psychotic life-adjustment offer a more favorable outlook, in contrast to introversion and inadequacy of reaction to life situations. However, it should be noted that evaluation of these factors on the basis of information obtained from relatives and friends is only approximate. In general, the catatonic subtype offers the best prognosis and paranoids the worst, with simple and hebephrenic subtypes in an intermediate position. Acute cases which are so atypical as not to allow classification under any of these four subtypes, are especially favorable prognostically. A progressive hospital course is ominous, whereas improvement or fluctuation is indicative of a more favorable outcome. Male or female sex, education and abilities, and psycho-sexual history seem to have no prognostic significance. Likewise the factor of age at onset of illness does not contribute to the assessment of outcome, except that relatively late age offers an unfavorable prognosis.",

Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

PMDD is distinguished from PMS by the severity of symptoms, predominance of mood symptoms, and role dysfunction, particularly in personal relationships and marital/family domains. Several treatment modalities are beneficial in PMDD and severe PMS, but the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged as first-line therapy. The SSRIs can be administered continuously throughout the entire month, intermittently from ovulation to the onset of menstruation, or semi-intermittently with dosage increases during the late luteal phase. These guidelines present practical treatment algorithms for the use of SSRIs in women with pure PMDD or severe PMS, PMDD and underlying subsyndromal clinical features of mood or anxiety, or premenstrual exacerbation of a mood/anxiety disorder.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioural symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in a close reciprocal relation with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other non-antidepressant treatments, or the more extreme intervneitons that eliminate ovulation altogether, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that SSRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SSRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

Highly comorbid with panic disorder, agoraphobia refers to marked fear or avoidance of specific situations from which escape is perceived to be difficult or in which help may be unavailable in the event of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms. This chapter focuses on the assessment of panic disorder and agoraphobia in adults. It begins with a review of the nature of the disorders, which is followed by a review of clinical assessment instruments designed for the assessment purposes of (a) diagnosis, (b) case conceptualization and treatment planning, and (c) treatment monitoring and evaluation. Recommendations are included for instruments with the greatest scientific support and for assessing these anxiety disorders in a clinically sensitive manner.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

      "title": "Female Sexual Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "In Brief Low or absent sexual desire is the most common sexual dysfunction in women, and its prevalence peaks during midlife. Its etiology is complex and may include biologic, psychologic, and social elements. Major risk factors for its development include poor health status, depression, certain medications, dissatisfaction with partner relationship, and history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or both. Diagnosis is based on criteria set by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) and requires that a woman experience personal distress. Clinical evaluation should include medical history, sexual history, and, sometimes, a physical examination. Laboratory data are of limited value, except when warranted by history or physical examination. Treatment options include nonpharmacologic interventions such as education, office-based counseling, and psychotherapy. Although there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved treatments for low desire, pharmacologic agents have been used off-label for this purpose. Bupropion is an antidepressant that has been shown to improve desire in some women with and without depression. Systemic estrogen therapy is not recommended in the absence of vasomotor symptoms and is not directly associated with desire. However, vaginal estrogen is useful in patients presenting with concomitant vaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that can be used as an alternative to vaginal estrogen. Exogenous testosterone has demonstrated efficacy in treating loss of desire in postmenopausal women. However, patients should be counseled that it is not FDA-approved for this purpose and there are limited published long-term safety data. Several agents for the treatment of low desire are currently in development. Gynecologists are in a unique position to address concerns about sexual desire in women. Low or absent sexual desire is the most common sexual dysfunction among women.",

      "title": "Clumsy Child",
      "abstract": "It has been estimated that 6% to 7% of school-aged children manifest poor coordination.1 Clinicians will rarely identify the presence of this type of disability from their findings during routine physical and neurologic examinations. What is required is careful observation of the child during performance of fine and gross developmental motor tasks. It is infrequent that parents will express concern to the pediatrician, unless they have clues from nursery school or grade school teachers, coaches, peers, or, occasionally, from the child him- or herself. The child is usually the first one to be aware of motor limitations, especially when he or she is in competition with children of the same age. Unfortunately, the child does not usually verbalize his or her concern but will refrain from participating in competitive motor activities to conceal motor inadequacies. DEFINITION The term \"clumsy child\" refers to a boy or girl who performs fine and/or gross motor tasks in an immature, disorganized, erratic, slow, irregular, or inconsistent fashion. The relevant motor skills are imprecise rather than grossly impaired and the neurologic examination does not reveal significant postural disabilities or involuntary movements. SIGNIFICANCE A pediatrician should not minimize the significance of clumsiness. It is frequently associated with other evidence of cerebral dysfunction, such as cognitive and/or perceptual impairments that may result in learning disabilities.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic neurological disorder in young and middle-aged adults. It involves exclusively the central nervous system (CNS). It is an inflammatory disorder consecutive to the formation of venule-centered areas, or plaques, scattered haphazardly. These plaques contain reactive cells and harbor myelin and axonal damage. Whether remyelination is a constant feature is at issue, but, if it is present, it is clearly ineffective at restoring myelin and axonal integrity. The consensus is that MS is an atypical autoimmune disorder (Reder and Antel, 1983). A genetic contribution to the etiology has been deduced from family studies (Sadovnick et al., 1997, 1998). MS is twice as common in women than it is in men, and affects predominantly Caucasians (Whitacre et al., 1999). The most classical clinical manifestation of MS is a relapse, which is an acute or subacute episode of neurological dysfunction lasting several weeks, followed by a remission. Relapses are unpredictable in time course, severity, duration, and site of lesion. MS course is usually protracted, only five or six years of overall longevity being lost (Sadovnick et al., 1992). Although still incurable, therapeutic breakthroughs have been attained that partially decrease the formation of new plaques (Paty and Hartung, 1999).",

This definition is derived initially from behavioral models of learning, and in the field of addiction, most work with sensitization refers to the progressive increase in the motor stimulant effect of amphetamine-like psychostimulants that is elicited by repeated drug administration (2,3). Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acute stress disorder (ASD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by exposure to a traumatic event followed by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-arousal, peritraumatic dissociation, and impairment in functioning. ASD's time-limited duration (two days to one month) makes it distinct from but related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed after one month. ASD's brief duration has contributed to a dearth of large-scale, population-based studies. Smaller studies have sought to determine rates of ASD after specific events in select populations; others have focused on ASD's role in predicting PTSD. Much can be learned from existing epidemiological studies. ASD's prevalence varies from 3% in a population of accident victims to 59% in female sexual assault victims. Female gender is a key risk factor; marital status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status have also been associated with ASD in some studies. Comorbidities include depressive and anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.",

      "abstract": "In order to know the general features of low back pain and sciatica in the aged, about 1000 cases consisting of four groups aged 60 years or over were analysed. The results are summarized as follows:1. About 60% of all the cases had low back pain and/or other related symptoms; about 20% had their activities disturbed to some extent; and about 25% wanted to be treated.2. Low back pain was more frequent than sciatica or intermittent claudication, but the latter was more disabling.3. Sciatica was very frequent on the affected side of the hemiplegic patients, and it was presumed to be related to some lesion of the central nervous system.4. Significant relationship between radiographic abnormalities and symptoms or signs could not be detected.5. Although conservative treatment has been a method of choice in most of the cases, an operative intervention should be considered for the cases of severe symptoms even in aged people.",

      "title": "Clinical uses of H reflexes of upper and lower limb muscles",
      "abstract": "H reflexes can be recorded from virtually all muscles that have muscle spindles, but reflex reinforcement may be required for the reflex response to be demonstrable. This can allow conduction across proximal nerve segments and most nerve root segments commonly involved by pathology. Stimulus rate is critical in subjects who are at rest. However the reflex attenuation with higher rates is greatly reduced during a background contraction of the test muscle, with only minor changes in latency if any. In addition the contraction ensures that the reflex response occurs in the desired muscle. Reflex latencies should be corrected for height (or limb length) and age. Because the reflex discharge requires a synchronised volley in group Ia afferents, large increases in reflex latency occur rarely with purely sensory lesions. If the H reflex of soleus, quadriceps femoris or flexor carpi radialis is absent at rest but appears during a voluntary contraction at near-normal latency, there is either low central excitability or a predominantly sensory abnormality. With the former H reflexes will be difficult to elicit throughout the body. If H reflexes can be recorded at rest from muscles for which no reflex can normally be demonstrated, there is good evidence for hyperreflexia. In the context of possible ALS, this is an important finding when there is EMG evidence of chronic partial denervation in that muscle.",

      "title": "Mouse Model of Chronic Social Stress‐Induced Excessive Pavlovian Aversion Learning‐Memory",
      "abstract": "Abstract Increased experience of aversive stimuli/events is a psychological‐neurobiological state of major importance in psychiatry. It occurs commonly in generalized anxiety disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder, and major depression. A sustained period of exposure to threat (chronic stressor) is a common risk factor, and a major symptom is generalized excessive perception of, and reactivity to, aversive stimuli. In rodents, Pavlovian aversion learning and memory (PAL, PAM), quantified in terms of the conditioned defensive behavior freezing, is an extensively studied behavioral paradigm, and well understood in terms of underlying neural circuitry. In mice, chronic social stress (CSS) is a 15‐day resident‐intruder paradigm in which C57BL/6 adult males are exposed continuously and distally to dominant‐aggressive CD‐1 male mice (sustained threat) interspersed with a brief daily period of proximal attack (acute threat). To ensure that physical wounding is minimized, proximal attacks are limited to 30 to 60 s/day and lower incisor teeth of CD‐1 mice are blunted. Control (comparison) mice are maintained in littermate pairs. The CSS and CD‐1 mice are maintained in distal contact during subsequent behavioral testing. For PAL, CSS and control (CON) mice are placed in a conditioning chamber (context) and exposed to a tone [conditioned stimulus (CS)] and mild, brief foot shock [unconditioned stimulus (US)]. For PAM, mice are placed in the same context and presented with CS repetitions. The CSS mice acquire (learn) and express (memory) a higher level of freezing than CON mice, indicating that CSS leads to generalized hypersensitivity to aversion, i.e., chronic social aversion leads to increased aversion salience of foot shock. Distinctive features of the model include the following: high reproducibility; rare, mild wounding only; male specificity; absence of “susceptible” vs “resilient” subgroups; behavioral effects dependent on continued presence of CD‐1 mice; and preclinical validation of novel compounds for normalizing aversion hypersensitivity with accurate feedforward prediction of efficacy in human patients. © 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "Auch mit dieser Ausgabe werden die Fortschritte der Neurologie und Psychiatrie ihrem Titel voll gerecht. Von Seiten des psychiatrischen Fachgebietes findet sich ein äußerst spannender und lehrreicher CME-Beitrag zu Zwangsstörungen, in dem insbesondere die Expositionsbehandlung und die Besonderheiten der Kompaktbehandlung besprochen werden. Als Kernsymptome der Zwangsstörung werden entsprechend den Ausführungen von Schäfer et al. Zwangsgedanken und/oder Zwangshandlungen beschrieben. Die Zwangsgedanken müssen explizit exploriert werden, da sie nicht von allen Patienten, da sie zum Teil schambehaftet sind, frei geäußert werden. Zwangshandlungen müssen ebenso erfragt werden, wobei Waschzwang, Kontrollzwang, exzessives Ordnen und pathologisches Wiederholen von Handlungsabläufen typische Zwangshandlungen sind. Sowohl Zwangshandlungen als auch Zwangsgedanken sollen mindestens eine Stunde pro Tag bei Patienten vorliegen, bevor die genannte Diagnose gestellt werden darf. Männer und Frauen erkranken gleich häufig und es ist davon auszugehen, dass bis zu 3% der Menschen im Laufe ihres Lebens eine Zwangsstörung entwickeln. Somit ist dieses Krankheitsbild von hoher klinischer Relevanz und sehr häufig noch verstärkt durch zusätzliche depressive Störungen, soziale Phobien oder eine generalisierte Angststörung. Damit kommt der Therapie dieser Zwangserkrankungen hohe Relevanz zu, die das Kernthema des vorliegenden CME-Artikels von Schäfer et al. sind. Die Autoren erläutern, dass bei der expositionsbasierten Psychotherapie 3 Phasen durchschritten werden müssen, nämlich die Vorbereitungs-, Konfrontations- und Nachbereitungsphase, die allesamt ausführlich beschrieben werden. Basierend auf Arbeiten aus Norwegen wird bei der Kompaktbehandlung ein ultrakurzes, intensives Therapieformat gewählt, wobei Patienten mit Zwangsstörungen eine individuell zugeschnittene expositionsbasierte Behandlung an 4 aufeinanderfolgenden Tagen mit insgesamt ca. 28 Therapiestunden absolvieren müssen. Des Weiteren wird die Technik des Loslassens ausführlich geschildert. Für alle genannten Therapieformen werden Fallbeispiele herangezogen und die wissenschaftliche Evidenz für ein Ansprechen dieser Therapie ausführlich diskutiert. Die Autoren schlussfolgern, dass die kognitive Verhaltenstherapie mit Exposition die Behandlung der ersten Wahl für Personen mit Zwangsstörungen sein sollte.",

      "abstract": "Although the advent and widespread use of ataractic drugs has more or less eclipsed lobotomy as a method of dealing with severe psychotic states, variations and adaptations of the operation still can be used with benefit in certain pretty well defined circumstances.\"Chemical lobotomy\" and regressive electroshock bring about alterations in behavior superficially resembling those of lobotomy, but without the changes in personality that are the object of lobotomy. These desirable changes consist in increased extraversion, decreased preoccupation with self and decreased sensitivity to the opinions of others. With restricted operations, undesirable changes-the \"frontal lobe syndrome\"-do not occur. OPERATIVE FAILURES ARE DUE TO THREE MAIN CAUSES: (a) Preoperative emotional deterioration; (b) progress of the underlying disease; (c) relapse, possibly due to inadequate operation. Lobotomy is advisable if the patient does not show sustained improvement after a year of active treatment by other indicated means. The operation often represents the turning point in effective treatment. After the first year of ineffective treatment valuable time is being lost, with danger of fixation and deterioration. Then it is safer to operate than to wait. The future of psychosurgery lies in prompt application, in favorable patients, of selective operations that will reverse the trend of illness. There is particular need for further exploration of the temporal lobes in the hope of finding some procedure that will suppress hallucinations. Some 90 per cent of patients remaining in hospitals after psychosurgery are experiencing hallucinations. If these phenomena can be eliminated without producing serious personality defects, another large field for the application of psychosurgery will be opened.",

EnglishFrustration can be mitigated if there has been previous experiences with similar low levels of reinforcement. SNC has demonstrated to be a very complex model. From the first to the second postshift day, the behavioral response has been attenuated. From the physiological evaluation carried out, the response recorded tends to remain over the days. That physiological response is maintained on the second postshift day, 300 minutes after the devaluation of the enhancer. Frustration involves processes such as memory, learning and anxiety. The reduction of frustration in post-shift 1 and 2 through a single administration of Sig1R agonist drugs supports this hypothesis.

      "title": "Disease activity and stress are linked in a subpopulation of chronic spontaneous urticaria patients",
      "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterized by the development of itchy wheals (hives), angioedema, or both, with reoccurring symptoms for more than 6 weeks. CSU is often fluctuating and unpredictable in its course,1 which is a great burden to the patients, especially when no underlying causes are found. Psychosomatic and psychiatric comorbidities are often reported and an association between CSU and stress was proposed, in which psychosocial strain may initiate a vicious cycle of stress-induced worsening of the disease causing a higher psychosocial burden, which in turn amplifies the stress influence on the disease.2-5 At present, systematic studies in support of a stress- and disease-relationship in CSU are largely missing, rendering the stress-contribution to CSU unclear. Comprehensive studies of the association between stress and urticaria are needed to answers to the following questions: Do CSU patients report relevant stress levels? Are stress levels higher when no underlying cause can be identified (CSU‒ CSU+ patients)? Do CSU‒ patients suffer from higher disease activity compared to CSU+ patients? And finally, are stress levels in CSU‒ and CSU+ patients linked to disease activity? To address these knowledge gaps, we studied stress perception and resilience and their association with disease severity, assessed by use of the urticaria activity score (UAS7) in an explorative manner. In addition, selected routinely assessed immune outcomes that have been discussed to play a role in stress effects in urticaria (IgE, basophils, eosinophils) were studied. The exploratory study was approved by ethics committee of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. A total of 303 CSU patients that provided informed written consent were assessed for mental distress, resilience, and immune outcomes (ELISA, complete blood count), and then, for potentially relevant underlying conditions, the results of which were disclosed to the patient after completion of the comprehensive workup of the etiologic tests by a team of experienced dermatologists (EMP, MM, MM). The scales \"worries,\" \"tension,\" \"and \"demands\" of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) were used to assess stress perception, \"joy\" and the Self-efficacy, Optimism and Pessimism (SWOP) questionnaire to assess resilience to stress.6, 7 PSQ \"summary score\" values above 50 are one SD (=17) higher, values below 16 are one SD lower than the mean (=33) in a German reference population,6 and were set as cutoffs for severe, medium and low stress, respectively. Additional data obtained included age, sex, body mass index, previous steroid- and anti-histamine intake. Investigated potentially relevant underlying clinical and laboratory conditions included autoreactivity, chronic viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, intolerance to food components, intolerance to physical provocation and chronic inflammatory diseases including autoimmune disorders and allergies. In 249 CSU patients, potentially relevant underlying conditions were identified (CSU+) as opposed to 54 patients without potentially relevant underlying conditions (CSU‒). Only a minority received oral medication prior to the assessment (antihistamines 20%, steroids 6%) and no medication or demographic differences were found between CSU+ and CSU‒ patients (Table S1). Levels of self-reported stress perception and resilience in CSU patients showed a wide range of mental distress levels, with low, moderate, and high PSQ scores in 21%, 64%, and 15% of patients, respectively. The mean PSQ \"summary score\" in women (32.05 ± 17.04, 72% of all patients) was slightly but not significantly higher than in men (29.82 ± 15.06). Patients younger than 45 years (55% of all patients) had slightly but not significantly higher PSQ \"summary score\" levels (33.12 ± 16.20) than older patients (29.55 ± 16.73). Chronic spontaneous urticaria‒ patients had significantly higher disease activity than CSU+ patients (Figure 1A). In CSU‒ patients, 52.6%, 31.6%, and 15.8% had UAS7 levels indicative of mild, moderate, and severe CSU, respectively, as compared to 64.2%, 25.8%, and 10% in CSU+ patients. CSU‒ patients reported higher PSQ \"worries,\" \"tension,\" and \"demands,\" with statistically increased values for the scale \"tension\" (Figure 1B,C, Table S2). In contrast, stress resilience in CSU‒ and CSU+ patients was similar. No group differences with respect to selected immunological measures such as total serum IgE, blood basophil and eosinophil counts were found (Table S3). Correlation analyses revealed that in CSU‒ patients, UAS7 scores showed a moderate positive correlation with the results of the PSQ-scales \"demands\" (r = .362; P = .028) and a trend for \"tension\" (r = .292; P = .0791) (Table 1). A regression analysis (including the confounders age, gender, and body mass index) confirmed these links in CSU‒ patients (adjusted R2 \"demands\" = 0.195; F(1/35) = 9.746; P = .004, Figure 1D; adjusted R2 \"tension\" = 0.082; F(1/35) = 4.218; P = .048, Figure 1E). The explained variance of 19.5% expresses a medium effect of f2 = 0.24 and of 8.2% a low effect of f2 = 0.09, respectively. By contrast, the common confounders age, gender, and body mass index were not significant predictors of the UAS7 in this group. Our comprehensive analyses of stress in patients with CSU are the first to demonstrate that most CSU patients report stress, but also that mean levels of mental distress are comparable to the general population.8 More importantly, our findings confirm that in CSU‒ perceived stress and disease activity are linked in the absence of demographic group differences and even before CSU‒ patients know that no underlying cause for their urticaria will be found. These observations are relevant and may help to destigmatize CSU patients, who often feel that their doctors and peers do not take their disease-burden seriously and attribute their suffering to the seemingly minor mental problem of having too much stress. In conclusion, our findings suggest a possible causal link between CSU and mental distress and encourage further research to confirm whether the increased levels of stress in the CSU‒ subpopulation are the reason or the result of their high disease levels. Clearly, in some CSU patients, the signs and symptoms of urticaria and stress are linked, which confirms the need to assess both the clinical symptoms and stress, ideally by daily diary-assessments and during patient visits, and also to address both by therapy and research, for example by the implementation of psychological interventions.

It is suggested that premenstrual symptoms are an expression of vulnerability traits that might surface in response to a trigger. Such traits are probably diverse, and the nature of the symptoms might depend upon the underlying trait. It is postulated that some vulnerability traits to specific premenstrual syndromes might also be vulnerability traits to depression or anxiety in general.",

      "title": "Molecular and Genetic Basis of Stress",
      "abstract": "A person’s reaction to trauma depends on the traumatic situation itself, personality characteristics of the person exposed to trauma, and posttraumatic social environment. Stressor must be extreme event that is extremely dangerous or fatal nature, and which is outside normal human experience [1]. Studies investigating psychological consequences of military and civil trauma confirmed the correlation between the nature and intensity of trauma, previous traumatic experience, and psychological consequences. Stress causes the autonomic nervous system hyperactivity. If the stress is extreme or constant symptoms of hyperactivity, increased heart rate, increased respiration, sweating, muscle tension, insomnia and increased anxiety are becoming significant for the prolonging the symptoms of PTSD. Our cells are well adapted to exposure to a mild stress for a short time. In contrast there are potentially serious consequences of exposure to the prolonged stress[2]. Various damages arising from the war in Bosnia (1992 - 1995) are almost undetectable, and the consequences for the mental health of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina are long and painful. It is estimated that in Bosnia and Herzegovina there are 1.75 million people who have some stress-related mental disorders, of which 1 million in the Federation. PTSD may be represented by mutations that must be carried by many genes. There may even be epigenetic reasons for the disorder that have nothing to do with heritable mutations per se. Epigenetic means related to functional changes in the genome that can be regulated by external environmental events that do not involve alterations in the genetic code. One epigenetic mechanism is called “methylation,” a molecular process that affects the activity of a large percentage of genes. Epigenetic investigations say that methylation may be involved in the development of stress regulation in early life[3]. A number of longitudinal studies have looked at independent variables spanning the entire course of the illness. A 10-year follow-up study in Holocaust survivors clearly demonstrated decline in stress hormone levels for those patients in whom PTSD developed or in whom PTSD was chronic. No such decline was shown for those survivors who did not present with PTSD. Indeed, they showed a relative increase in hormone levels [4]. Hippocampal volume has also been studied (using the same types of experiments as the twin studies described previously). Hippocampal volume can be quite variable. It can change as a result of environmental exposure, duration of certain illnesses, and even the age of the subject. As noted, shrunken hippocampal volume has been shown in PTSD patients, but most of these are younger cohorts. When one examines PTSD in older cohorts, the differences in volume evaporate, and no linkage with disease is observed [5]. Microarray analysis is a powerful way to look at global gene expression profiles in tissues which can identify relevant molecular processes. On that way we have enough tools on hand to find the genes responsible for the disorder. Studying such genes can lead to creating effective treatments, including designing medications that are not only specific to the disorder but also specific to an individual’s experience with the disorder.",

These impairments can have a functional origin, but more commonly they result from neurological injury or disease. Functional amnesia is a psychiatric disorder. The amnesia in this case is presumed to result from conflict and repression, and its presentation varies from individual to individual. Typically, a patient is admitted to the hospital in a confused or frightened state. Memory for the past has been lost, especially personal, autobiographical memory. Often, the patient cannot produce his or her own name. Yet, the ability to learn new material is almost always intact. After the disorder clears, usually within a week, the lost memories return except for the events of the day or two just prior to hospital admission. Rarely, the disorder lasts longer, and sizable pieces of the past remain unavailable.",

Il testosterone (T) e la prolattina (PRL) sono i piu importanti\r\nfattori ormonali implicati nel controllo del desiderio sessuale. In quest’articolo descriviamo come altri fattori psico-biologici, individuati attraverso l’utilizzo dell’intervista strutturata SIEDY, siano associati al DDSI in un campione di pazienti maschi che si rivolgono ad un ambulatorio andrologico riportando un disturbo della sessualita. Diversi fattori relazionali (riduzione della capacita orgasmica e libidica della partner come percepita dal paziente, presenza di malattie nella partner, relazioni prolungate e conflittuali) e stressogeni ambientali\r\n(soddisfazione sul lavoro e/o presenza di conflittualita familiare) sono risultati significativamente associati con il DDSI. Tra i fattori ormonali, una iperprolattinemia severa (>700 mU/l), sembra giocare un ruolo maggiore rispetto all’ipogonadismo (testosterone < 12 nM) sulla\r\npatogenesi del DDSI (RR= 7.5 [2.5-22.4] vs 1.5 [1.1-1.9], rispettivamente). La presenza di disturbi psichiatrici maggiori o l’utilizzo di farmaci con impatto potenzialmente negativo sulla funzione sessuale sono altri parametri associati al DDSI cosi come la presenza di sintomi\r\nd’ansia e depressivi. In conclusione, il DDSI e associato a diversi fattori organici, intrapsichici e relazionali che possono essere simultaneamente individuati attraverso l’utilizzo di SIEDY.",

      "abstract": "Mass hysteria is the common term used to describe a situation in which various people all suffer from similar unexplained symptoms1. Hysterical contagion consists of a quick dissemination within a collection of people of a symptom, or a set of symptoms for which no physical explanation can be found2. Mass hysteria typically begins when an individual becomes ill or hysterical during a period of stress. After this initial individual shows symptoms, others begin to manifest similar symptoms3. Symptoms recorded during outbreaks of mass hysteria include abdominal pains, chest tightness, dizziness, fainting, headaches, hyperventilation, nausea, vomiting, palpitations; anxiety, conversion disorder and screaming. Mass hysteria is a social phenomenon often occurring among otherwise healthy people who suddenly believe they have been made ill by some external factor. It spreads by sight and or sound and occurs most often among adolescents or preadolescents4. In groups of students, its incidence is reportedly higher among girls than boys. Symptoms often follow an environmental trigger or illness in an index case and spread rapidly by audiovisual cues, often aggravated by a prominent emergency or media response5. Symptoms frequently resolve after patients are separated from each other, removed from the environment in which the outbreak began and after being convinced that the illness is over or never existed. Literature suggests that mass hysteria episodes have frequently occurred in Africa. This paper provides a literature review of documented episodes of mass hysteria in African schools.",

      "title": "Conversion and Somatization in Pediatrics",
      "abstract": "Although conversion disorder rarely is diagnosed formally in ordinary pediatric practice, busy pediatricians often do encounter the phenomenon of conversion. Conversion is the experiencing of unacceptable emotional conflicts as symptoms, usually but not always physical, rather than as mental events. Conversion is commonplace, affecting almost all body systems. It must be recognized and managed appropriately early in its course, lest inappropriate evaluations and treatments occur; in addition to their other costs, such unnecessary procedures may introduce the child inadvertently to such symptomatization as a life-long pattern of behavior. More than a century ago, Briquet recognized that at least 50% of adult professional begin their symptomatic careers before puberty; thus, inappropriate care of the young patient who has conversion symptoms may have serious, long-lasting consequences. Problems in Diagnosing Conversion The traditional diagnostic elements of conversion often are difficult to demonstrate in pediatric practice. Almost all are either not specific to conversion or hard to confirm in young patients for reasons of developmental immaturity. These standard elements include the following: • Stress or conflict preceding symptoms (true of many illnesses) • Unconscious symptom production outside the patient9s awareness (thus often inaccessible to the pediatrician) • A model for the symptom (either unverifiable or prone to observer bias) • Primary gain or relief of underlying conflict (again, difficult to confirm)",

      "title": "Vagotonia and Cardiac Arrest during Spinal Anesthesia ",
      "abstract": "SUDDEN cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia can occur in otherwise healthy patients. 1–6Although respiratory depression secondary to excessive sedation is responsible in some cases, sudden cardiac arrest can occur without overt signs of respiratory depression in hemodynamically stable patients. 1Vasovagal reactions have been reported to cause cardiac arrest during spinal and epidural anesthesia. 5,6Increased vagal tone, or vagotonia, is present in approximately 7% of the population. 7Such individuals frequently have a history of recurrent reactions precipitated by emotional or physical stress. Vagotonic manifestations can include nausea, sweating, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. 7,8If a patient who is prone to have vasovagal reactions is exposed to emotional stress during spinal anesthesia, what might otherwise be a benign or transient reaction may progress to cardiac arrest. 5,6Two incidents of syncope and asystole, during two separate spinal anesthetics, are described in a patient with a history of recurrent vasovagal reactions.A 37-yr-old, 170-cm, 67-kg, 14-weeks-pregnant patient was scheduled to undergo cerclage for cervical incompetence. Medications included prenatal vitamins, and no allergies were reported. An electrocardiogram was not available. The remainder of the history and physical examination were unremarkable, except for a history of \"passing out\" if exposed to needles. Three years earlier, the patient fainted during a spinal anesthetic for a similar procedure. Medical records from the first cerclage were received only after discharge from this admission. Then, the patient was 12 weeks pregnant and scheduled for her first cervical cerlage. She was given 50 mg of 5% lidocaine without epinephrine in the sitting position. Soon thereafter, she fainted, but she recovered spontaneously after 30–60 s. Blood pressure (130/80 mmHg) and heart rate (85 beats/min) were reported as stable during the syncopal episode. The anesthesiologist did not record or recall the sensory level achieved by the spinal anesthetic, except that the level was not high and sensory and motor function of the upper extremities was intact. No sedation was administered. Despite the patient's fear of needles, she consented to a spinal anesthetic for the second procedure.Upon arrival in the operating room, standard monitors were applied, including a pulse oximeter and a nasal cannula with an end-tidal carbon dioxide sampling port. Midazolam, 2 mg intravenously, was given to reduce her anxiety during placement of the spinal anesthetic. Before the intrathecal injection, 1,500 ml of Ringer's lactated solution was administered intravenously. An intrathecal injection of 80 mg of 5% lidocaine in dextrose was performed using a 25-gauge needle, with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Immediately after the injection of the anesthetic, the patient was moved to the supine position. The operating table was tilted so that the patient's head was elevated slightly. Blood pressure and heart rate decreased slightly from 120/70 to 105/65 mmHg and 80 to 70 beats/min, respectively, after injection of the anesthetic. A stable T4 level was achieved 10 min after the lidocaine injection. The patient was awake and breathing comfortably. Twenty minutes after administration of the spinal anesthetic, the patient complained of left hand and arm pain as an antibiotic was given intravenously. Immediately after verbalizing these complaints, bradycardia was noted, which progressed to asystole with loss of consciousness and no palpable blood pressure. The patient was given 100% oxygen by mask, chest compressions were begun, and 1 mg of atropine was administered intravenously. Approximately 30 s later, a sinus rhythm and palpable pulse were noted, and chest compressions were discontinued. Blood pressure and heart rate were 115/70 mmHg and 90 beats/min, respectively; the patient was awake, alert, and breathing without difficulty. Hand strength was not diminished, and the sensory level remained at T4. The patient stated, \"I guess that I passed out again.\"The balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity is not equal in approximately 7% of the population who have increased vagal tone, or vagotonia. 7Although vagotonia can occur at any age, it frequently is observed in young, athletic individuals and typically is precipitated by an emotionally or physically stressful event. Pallor, weakness, sweating, nausea, and retching frequently precede unconsciousness. Physiologic studies have demonstrated that vagal stimulation decreases heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. 8Electrophysiologic studies have demonstrated that conduction across the atrioventricular node is prolonged or dissociated, and resting electrocardiograms frequently reveal first- or second-degree atrioventricular block. 7Significant bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope for up to 20 min can occur, even in the absence of anesthesia. Patients with severe or frequent syncope may be treated long-term with atropine, a sympathomimetic agent, or a permanent pacemaker. 7In most other cases, symptoms usually are transient and resolve spontaneously, as the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity is restored.The primary physiologic mechanism responsible for the syncope and cardiac arrest in this patient could be (1) uniquely related to the underlying vagotonia, (2) caused by a combination of the underlying vagotonia and the autonomic disturbances caused by the spinal anesthesia, (3) caused solely by the autonomic perturbations of the spinal anesthesia, or (4) related to either the underlying vagotonia or the autonomic disturbances but unable to make a distinction.We believe that the syncopal incident during the first cerclage was uniquely related to the underlying vagotonia. Our patient was young and athletic and had a history of \"passing out\" if exposed to needles. Considering her underlying vagotonia it is not surprising that a reaction occurred in a hospital setting with ample exposure to needles and other stressful circumstances. The sensation of the spinal needle as it entered or exited the skin, or exposure to a sensory-level testing needle, was probably the precipitating event.The cardiac arrest during the second cerclage resulted from a combination of the underlying vagotonia and the autonomic changes accompanying the spinal anesthesia. If the sympathetic system is blocked by a spinal anesthetic, and a vasovagal reaction occurs, then the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems may be disturbed even further. The additional vagal stimulation may lead to bradycardia and cardiac arrest. 3,5,6Blood pressure and heart rate were stable for over 20 min before asystole suddenly occurred after a painful intravenous injection. This stress event produced additional vagal stimulation, which in the presence of a sympathetic blockade led to cardiac arrest. In the absence of either contributing factor, the autonomic disturbances of the spinal anesthesia or the vagotonia, symptoms may been mild or unappreciated.The autonomic changes that accompany spinal anesthesia can cause significant bradycardia and hypotension and could have been the sole cause of either the syncope or cardiac arrest. However, the syncope during the first episode occurred almost immediately after the intrathecal injection, before the local anesthetic had time to have an effect, and blood pressure and pulse were stable, and motor and sensory function in the upper extremity were intact before and after the cardiac arrest. For these reasons, it seems unlikely that the described events were solely related to the spinal anesthesia.Although reported, 1respiratory depression is an unlikely explanation for either described incident. The patient received no sedation during the first anesthetic and received only 2 mg intravenous midazolam before cardiac arrest and was responsive, without change in pulse oximetry or end-tidal carbon dioxide readings.Treatment of sinus arrest during spinal anesthesia depends upon the mechanisms responsible. Because most vagally mediated syncopal episodes resolve rapidly and spontaneously, treatment may be unnecessary. However, if the hypotension, bradycardia, or sinus arrest do not resolve quickly, then a vagolytic agent, such as atropine, or a sympathomimetic agent may be appropriate. Because the bradycardia and sinus arrest were felt to be vagally mediated during the second cerclage, atropine was administered intravenously and proved to be effective. If no response was observed with atropine, epinephrine would have been the next best choice. Administering a potent sympathomimetic agent as the first line of treatment, particularly if there is any doubt as to the cause of the cardiac arrest, has its advantages. Alpha-adrenergic stimulation raises systemic vascular resistance essential for coronary and cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and β-stimulation opposes the negative chronotropic and the inotropic effects of vagal stimulation.Prompt treatment is important. In a closed-claim study, Caplan et al. 1attributed significant neurologic injury or death to delayed treatment of cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia. Prophylactic treatment also may be warranted. A history of syncope after exercise or noxious stimuli and first- or second-degree atrioventricular block indicate a state of vagotonia. Prophylactic administration of atropine should be considered, and an external pacemaker readily available.Otherwise healthy patients can experience sudden cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia. Vasovagal reactions can occur during spinal anesthesia, may exacerbate the adverse hemodynamic consequences of spinal anesthesia, and led to bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest. Our report suggests that a history of vasovagal reactions may indicate an increased risk of cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia. In such patients, the clinician should consider administration of prophylactic atropine and be prepared to provide prompt and appropriate resuscitative measures.",

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

The average time of occurrence of psychotic symptoms in our 3 cases after beginning of MAP abuse was two or three years. 2.) Although the psychotic states (often schizophrenia-like) were stable for a short time, the symptoms recurred promptly after reinjection of a small amount of MAP, unspecific stress or drinking sake (flashback phenomenon). The recurrence may happen even after several years. 3.) In cases of chronic MAP-P disturbances of consciousness are rare. Chronic process of MAP-P cases may show acute transient disturbances of consciousness (flashback phenomenon). 4.) The change of affects and behaviour ranges between irritable and indifferent attitudes. While there are close connections between the disturbance of feeling and change of personality (Wesensänderung), it is very difficult to decide whether premorbid character traits are dominant or there is a change of personality or emotional disturbance. 5.) About acute psychic symptoms which are responsible for recurrence of MAP-P, MAP-abusers make the experience that their intimate personal affairs are overlooked and become public (uncovered defensive experiences). In chronic cases of MAP-P we often meet patients with hypertrophic self-feeling or delusion of grandeur predominant in the symptomatology. 6.) In our cases sensations were amalgamated into each other and there were hallucinatory experiences without clear division between them. 7.) In chronic cases the auditory hallucinations criticized or censured the patients for their behaviour. Thought echoing (Gedankenlautwerden) was found.

      "title": "Anxiety disorders and addictions",
      "abstract": "This article will review data obtained from both clinical and preclinical investigations demonstrating that exposure to stress has a significant impact on drug addiction. The preclinical literature suggests that stress increases reward associated with psychomotor stimulants, possibly through a process similar to sensitization. While it is not conclusive that a similar process occurs in humans, a growing clinical literature indicates that there is a link between substance abuse and stress. One explanation for the high concordance between stress-related disorders and drug addiction is the self-medication hypothesis, which suggests that a dually diagnosed person often uses the abused substance to cope with tension associated with life stressors or to relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression resulting from a traumatic event. However, another characteristic of self-administration is that drug delivery and its subsequent effects on the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis are under the direct control of the individual. This controlled activation of the HPA axis may result in the production of an internal state of arousal or stimulation that is actually sought by the individual (i.e., the sensation-seeking hypothesis). During abstinence, exposure to stressors or drug-associated cues can stimulate the HPA axis to remind the individual about the effects of the abused substance, thus producing craving and promoting relapse. Continued investigations into how stress and the subsequent activation of the HPA axis impact addiction will result in the identification of more effective and efficient treatment for substance abuse in humans. Stress reduction, either alone or in combination with pharmacotherapies targeting the HPA axis may prove beneficial in reducing cravings and promoting abstinence in individuals seeking treatment for addiction.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Persistent sexual arousal syndrome (PSAS) is characterized by unwanted and distressing genital sensations that persist for long time periods without concurrent sexual desire or fantasies. The aetiology of this remains largely enigmatic although it is likely that the condition has a diverse set of neurological, vascular, pharmacological, and psychological precipitants. Objectives To analyze the case of a woman with schizoaffective disorder (severe depressive decompensation) and a comorbid PSAS. Methods We study the clinical case of a 47-year-old patient who was admitted to the acute care unit due to a major depressive condition with psychotic symptoms in the context of a schizoaffective disorder after partial abandonment and erratic taking of the medication she was previously taking. Before the admission, the patient was hypomimic, perplexed, with psychomotor inhibition, bradypsychia, thought blockages, sadness, emotional lability, apathy, anhedonia, paranoidism, phenomena of reading and thought control, self-referentiality, delusional ideas of harm and auditory pseudohallucinations in the form of voices that urge her to harm herself. In addition, the patient presented several “sexual” crises that appeared paroxysmal throughout the day, consisting of episodes of sexual hyperarousal in the absence of desire, experienced with intense guilt. Initially, a differential diagnosis was made through an extensive history and organic screening, and she was finally diagnosed with a comorbid PSAS. Results Complementary tests (complete blood, urine and imaging tests) were normal. At the pharmacological level, several strategies were used that were ineffective: paliperidone up to 18mg/day that had to be withdrawn due to intolerable extrapyramidal effects, olanzapine up to 15mg/day with high sleepiness and finally caripracin up to 12mg/day with good tolerance and efficacy. Stabilizing treatment (valproic acid 1000mg/day with optimal blood levels (99.3 microgr/mL)) were added. However, after a month and a half of admission and given the little improvement of the depressive symptoms, even having added an SSRI for 2 weeks at full doses, it was decided together with the patient and her family to start Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)sessions. The patient received 12 sessions of bitemporal ECT with onset of response from the 6th session, with a complete remission of the sexual crisis and depressive symptoms. Conclusions To our knowledge, Yero et al., reported the first two cases of patients with concomitant PSAS and bipolar disorder treated with ECT. It is important to understand how sexual symptoms differ in PSAS and bipolar disorder. Remission of the mood episode could have been accompanied by resolution of the sexual symptoms. Although ECT was successful, the mechanism of action in treating PSAS is unknown, and it is premature to suggest that it should be recommended as a first line treatment of PSAS.

Paraphilic disorders are defined as persistent, intense and atypical forms of sexual excitement that appear with clinically significant functional impairment. The original clinical use of the terms sadism and masochism was to describe the sexual perversions of attaining sexual pleasure by hurting or being hurt. These terms have been usefully expanded to mean emotional sadism and masochism: experiencing emotional satisfaction or comfort due to exercising power over another or submitting to another’s power. This disorder begins at an early age and most sadists and masochists are actually satisfied with their unconventional sexual activity. Personality disorders are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, based on descriptive similarities. Group B in the classification of personality disorder is composed of an antisocial, histrionic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorder. People who fall into this group are characterized by impulsiveness and emotional instability, in their behavior they are dramatic and mischievous. Unlike true love, falling in love by itself is not a conscious choice nor a willing act. Love constitutes a voluntary act with which spritiual growth and maturity of ourselves and others is achieved.

      "title": "Neurally mediated syncope",
      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "ACTIVE INFECTION IN PARKINSONISM.SOME well recognised features of postencephalitic Parkinsonism are of such a nature as to suggest to the clinician a chronicity of the infection in the brain.Among such features are (1) the gradual appearance and often steadv progression of the syndrome many months or several years after an acute encephalitic attack, the patient having, perhaps, been quite well in the interim: (2) the insidious development of the syndrome with no history of an acute attack (i.e., the infection being chronic from the first): (3) a certain amount of evidence of contagion long after the commencement of the illness: (4) the appearance and variable course in Parkinsonism of other encephalitic signs and symptoms; (5) the occasional recurrence of the disease in an acute form.perhaps months after the first attack.From the point of view of treatment it is important to deal with this question of active infection.Is it definitely shown that in some, or many, cases, the virus is still active ?Can those that are definitely still infected be discriminated from those where the symptoms are truly ' residua' ?What is known of the virus and can specific measures be used against it ?If not, what results would successful non-specific treat- ment bring?It is proposed in this review to discuss some of the evidence for and against the view that chronic infection may persist in Parkinsonism and to attempt to answer the above questions.THE PRESENCE OF CHRONIC INFECTION.The balance of the evidence and opinions put forward by large numbers of workers is overwhelmingly in favour of a persistence of the infection in many cases of 'post '-encephalitic Parkinsonism.Yet examination of all this work shows that the activity is very low-grade and probably often dies out completely.Von Economo himself first described a chronic type of case progressing by stages or 'shoves.' Nonne found that there might be an interval of from three to four years' freedom from symptoms between an acute attack and the appearance of sequelae, e.g., the Parkinsonian syndrome: and a latent period like this of as long as four or five years has frequentlv been noticed since.Wimmer, commenting on this interval, regards the postulation of a persistent infection in the brain as the best explanation and compares chronic T) 33 i",

Yet the problems of when to make an evaluation of the results of psychiatric therapy (whether repeatedly, during the course of, or immediately afterwards, or at variable and increasing intervals after it is over) have been almost wholly neglected.

On the contrary, in the latter case, it does not offer elements for any etiopathogenic hypothesis because it happens in almost all cases with an acute onset in an otherwise healthy subject and it is always underestimated because of the minor functional impairment. However, clinical studies in the last years led to a significant evolution of otological findings as an early important symptom in the etiopathogenic study and in the diagnosis of some internal diseases.

      "abstract": "A disfunção erétil (DE) é a incapacidade recorrente de obter e manter uma ereção que permita atividade sexual satisfatória, sendo a disfunção sexual que mais afeta os homens no envelhecimento. Estima-se que 50% dos homens acima de 40 anos apresentem essa disfunção. Como a prevalência é expressiva, torna-se necessária a realização de uma revisão da literatura sobre epidemiologia, fisiopatologia e tratamento acerca da DE, com o intuito de melhor compreensão da doença. A ereção é dependente de vários fatores como o relaxamento do músculo liso do corpo cavernoso, o aumento do fluxo arterial e a restrição do fluxo venoso de saída. Esses mecanismos podem estar prejudicados em várias doenças, sendo que, em alguns casos, a DE pode ser considerada como marcador precoce de problemas mais graves. Essa disfunção sexual apresenta várias etiologias: vascular, endócrina, neurológica, psicológica/psiquiátrica e relacionada às drogas ou às intervenções cirúrgicas. O próprio tratamento de algumas doenças de base pode ser a causa ou o agravamento da DE, como alguns anti-hipertensivos e antidepressivos. A principal explicação para a DE é a redução da disponibilidade de óxido nítrico, um importante vasodilatador. Contudo, fazem também parte de sua fisiopatologia a obstrução mecânica dos vasos sanguíneos e problemas de transmissão de estímulos neurológicos. A DE é primeiramente avaliada pelo método clínico, mas existem instrumentos avaliativos multidimensionais, sendo o Índice Internacional de Função Erétil considerado o padrão-ouro. O tratamento pontual para esta doença deve ser fundado na sua etiologia. Existem várias linhas de tratamento, sendo os inibidores da fosfodiesterase-5 e a psicoterapia (para DE psicogênica ou mista) os de primeira escolha, associados ou não à reposição de testosterona. Como segunda-linha, tem-se a injeção intracavernosa de substâncias vasoativas. Caso essas terapias não produzam resultado, a prótese peniana pode ser indicada.",

      "title": "Relationship between Postpartum Depression, Infant Temperament and Childcare Stress in Tirana, Albania",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe postpartum period represents one of the most important life stages of women in which the accurate detection and treatment of psychological distress is required. Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a depression episode that begins within six months after birth and matches the criteria of DSM - IV for major depression without psychotic consequences (1). The prevalence of PPD is about 8-35% depending on the method used for evaluation (2). PPD occurs when there is an increase in demands on a new mother due to the child development.Many different risk factors have been found to be at least moderately correlated with the presence of postpartum depression (3). These risk factors include a history of depression (preconception or prenatal), high stress level, high anxiety, and little or no social support. Although no single factor can be attributed to predicting postpartum depression, the combination of factors does seem very important in understanding both the short and long term outcomes as well as what strategies might be best for intervention.Characteristic symptoms of PPD are similar to those of major depression including: sadness, despair, anxiety, compulsive thoughts, and appetite and sleep disturbances. A new mother with PPD may also have thoughts of harming herself and/or her infant (4). In addition to directly affecting a new mother's mental health, PPD can interfere with a mother's ability to recognize and respond to the needs of her infant, increasing the risk for delays in infant development and behavioral problems in childhood (5). Consequently, PPD is considered a major form of depression which requires treatment and identification of women who may be at an increased risk. Lack of diagnosis of PPD can affect the mother, her child, family members, and society through medical expense, social dysfunction, illness, and even death (6).Postpartum depression and child characteristicsVarious studies have reported that child related factors were associated with postpartum depression. Cutrona (7) reported that high levels of child care related stressors were associated with high levels of depressive symptomatology, while Hopkins, Campbell and Marcus (8) found that having a difficult baby, or a baby with neonatal complications, was associated with a diagnosis of postpartum depression.Beck (9) studied two variables related to the infant; child temperament and childcare stress. She found that childcare stress and having an infant with a difficult temperament were moderately predictive of postpartum depressive symptomatology. It has been found that mothers suffering from postpartum depression give more negative descriptions of their children and report more behavioral problems in their infants, than control mothers (10). Therefore, the mothers' symptoms may be a source of bias in the reporting of infant characteristics.The early postpartum period is a time of potential stress for the mother as she assumes increasing responsibility in the parenting role (11,12). Symptoms of depressed mood emerge and occur more frequently during this stage (12). Since infant behavioral patterns also take shape early, it is possible that difficult temperament may either influence or be influenced by the maternal psychological state at this early postpartum stage (9,13,14).In this study the relationship between infant temperament, child care stress and postpartum depression during the first year postpartum is assessed. Temperament refers to individual differences in an infant's expressions of arousal and emotion and describes infant self-regulation, reactivity, and modulation (15). Emerging temperamental difficulty may affect maternal interactions with the infant and may shape her future expectations of the child, potentially posing a stress upon the parent-infant relationship (16). Child care stress refers to the mother's perception of infant health problems, problems with baby feeding and problems related to baby sleep. …",

Uno de estos síndromes es el de Persona Rígida que, aparte de ser una entidad rara, ocurre como un síndrome paraneoplásico apenas en el 5% de casos. Caso Clínico: Hombre de 72 años con cuadro de 2 meses de evolución que inició con espasmos musculares dolorosos en la región dorsal y lumbar, evolucionando a rigidez con postura en hiperextensión axial y apendicular, marcha pseudoespástica, hipe- rekplexia; ante la sospecha de síndrome de Persona Rígida se inició el trabajo diagnóstico y se encontraron niveles elevados de Ac anti GAD65 y posteriormente un Linfoma No Hodgkin.

      "abstract": "The term pseudoborderline syndrome refers to a form of atypical, masked depression with the symptomatology of borderline personality disorder. In contrast to what have been previously described as “subaffective disorders,” the condition presented here develops later in life, after a premorbid history of high social function and after long-lasting stresses or multiple losses before onset. Long-term course is that of an affective disorder, sometimes ending in suicide if not treated. It is also suggested that these patients undergo a process of regression under the influence of a chronic exposure to stress. The condition was initially observed among Eastern European immigrant patients but may also occur among individuals in high-stress jobs. The name “pseudoborderline syndrome” is proposed and it is speculated that masked affective disorders may appear in the form of “pseudo-syndromes”—pseudodementia, pseudomania, pseudohypochondriasis, pseudoborderline.",

Internet forums and blogs can serve as a good source of emotional support. Women use them much more frequently than men, and they report using these forums mainly to get empathy, warmth, understanding, sense of belonging, and to share their feelings.

      "title": "[Hypothyroidism--clinical findings, diagnosis, therapy. Thyroid tests should be performed on broad indications].",
      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical entity resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones or, more rarely, from their impaired activity at tissue level. It is a common condition, with a prevalence of 1.9 per cent in women, and the prevalence increases with age. Hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired, primary or secondary, chronic or transient. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by disease or treatment which destroys the thyroid gland or interferes with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is the predominant cause of primary hypothyroidism in countries such as Sweden where severe iodine deficiency is non-existent. Another cause of primary hypothyroidism, chronic or transient, is previous radio-iodine or surgical treatment of hypothyroidism. In secondary or central hypothyroidism, which is very rare, there is a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH activity, due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. The clinical features of hypothyroidism are dependent on the patient's age, the presence of other disease, and the rate at which hypothyroidism develops. As thyroid hormones are universal determinants of organ function, there may be a multiplicity of symptoms. Particularly in the elderly, the clinical features may be atypical, and the diagnosis easily missed. First line tests for hypothyroidism are analyses of the concentrations of free thyroxine (T4) and TSH in serum. In primary hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH high. In central hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH generally low or normal, though slightly increased levels of biologically inactive TSH may also occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterised by a normal serum level of T4, an increased level of TSH, and the absence of clinical symptoms. When a diagnosis of chronic hypothyroidism is confirmed, treatment with laevothyroxine is started, the initial dose being adjusted to the age and general condition of the patient, and the duration and severity of hypothyroidism. As a rule, full thyroxine replacement therapy should bring the serum TSH level into the normal range. In central hypothyroidism, laevothyroxine treatment is similar, but pituitary function must be evaluated and, if necessary, corticosteroid replacement be instituted before laevothyroxine treatment is started.",

Traumatic-stressor exposure is common and, for the majority of individuals exposed to stressors, normal psychological reactions that occur in the immediate aftermath will abate within days or months of the event.

      "title": "Depression During Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "The author of this article uses a case vignette to highlight issues related to the occurrence and management of depression in pregnancy. The case subject was a 24-year-old married pregnant woman with a history of depression who presented at 10 weeks of gestation with a 1-month history of symptoms strongly suggestive of recurrent depression. After an attempt of suicide 2 years before this pregnancy, she had been successfully treated with a short course of sertraline. She was not currently suicidal and wanted to continue the pregnancy. The author describes management options for this patient, discussing issues pertinent to diagnosis and treatment of major depression. Major depression is a common and treatable mental disorder affecting more than 12% of pregnant women. The natural course of major depression is variable in both pregnant and nonpregnant women. Over time, depression may become more severe or resistant to treatment. The likelihood of self-harm or suicide is difficult to predict and is a major consideration. A history of depression is the strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy. Physicians or other health care providers should ask all pregnant women or women considering pregnancy about a personal or family history of mental disorders and treatment. Any woman with symptoms suggestive of depression should undergo a complete evaluation. Untreated depression during pregnancy has been associated with increased risks of suicide, miscarriage, and preterm birth as well as poor fetal growth and impaired fetal and postnatal development. Multidisciplinary care is recommended, with involvement of the patient's obstetrician, primary care physicians, and mental health professionals. Valid choices for management include an antidepressant, cognitive behavioral therapy, and/or interpersonal psychotherapy. No safety data are available from randomized controlled trials of antidepressants during pregnancy, but observational data suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as sertraline, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are relatively safe during pregnancy, although they have been associated with fetal anomalies (particularly cardiac), miscarriage, preterm birth, and persistent neonatal pulmonary hypertension. Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors appear to be safer than tricyclic antidepressants. Given the previous response of the patient in the case vignette to sertraline, the author recommends using sertraline as initial treatment, with careful assessment for suicidality and side effects. Close monitoring throughout pregnancy and the first postpartum year is necessary because of the increased risk for postpartum depression.",

      "abstract": "Las convulsiones psicógenas no-epilépticas (CPNE) son parecidas a las convulsiones de tipo epiléptico, lo que suele traer mucha confusión al momento de ofrecer un diagnóstico diferencial. La diferencia medular radica en que las CPNE no son producidas por anomalías electrocorticales, y sí por factores psico-emocionales. En el presente artículo, presentamos una revisión actualizada del tema, con énfasis en aspectos fenomenológicos, de diagnóstico y de curso clínico. Para ilustrar la complejidad de las CPNE, presentamos varias viñetas clínicas que se basan en la experiencia del primer autor con más de 100 pacientes con CPNE. De nuestra revisión se desprende que las CPNE se relacionan a un menoscabo y a un deterioro marcado generalizado psicosocial. Esta situación se agrava cuando típicamente pasan años antes de ofrecerse el diagnóstico correcto. Asimismo, estudios retrospectivos y prospectivos documentan el punto de que típicamente más del 50% de estos pacientes presentan un historial previo de abuso físico, emocional y sexual. Al respecto, se presenta un modelo multicausal/multifactorial para dar cuenta de las variables que predisponen, precipitan y perpetúan la aparición de las CPNE. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are likely to be confused with epileptic seizures. The main difference is that PNES are not produced by anomalous electrical brain discharges, but by emotional and psychological dysfunctions. In the present article, we present an empirical and conceptual update on PNES, emphasizing the phenomenological, diagnostic and natural course of the disorder. To illustrate the clinical complexity of PNES, we present several clinical vignettes. We conclude that PNES are elated to psychosocial burden and to impairment in several important areas of living. This situation is aggravated when the esearch literature indicate that many PNES patients are misdiagnosed with epilepsy and do not receive adequate psychological/psychiatric care. Furthermore, patients with PNES typically report high rates of a wide plethora of abusive hildhood experiences. Lastly, we present a biopsychosocial conceptual framework to understand the emergence of this disorder.",

Social anxiety disorder is the most frequent anxiety disorder (10-15%) that occurs in two subtypes--generalized and specific. It is a disorder that occurs during the adolescence and reflects negatively to the quality of life of an individual. Neurobiological basis of this disorder has not been explored yet. The disorder is frequently burdened with comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, depression and substance-related disorders. Only cognitive-behavioral techniques are desirable in the psychotherapeutic treatment of the disorder and the best results are achieved in combination with pharmacotherapy. The medicaments of choice in the treatment of social anxiety disorder are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Anxiolytics should be used only as a supplementary in the acute phase. Treatment of social anxiety disorder should last at least 3 months up to one year.",

      "title": "Sexual Disorders in Females with Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Two or more attacks of hypomania, mania, depression, or mixed episodes, interspersed with euthymic intervals, constitute bipolar disorder (BD). Among the leading causes of disability globally, BD is a major concern. Among all mental health illnesses, sexual dysfunction is underestimated and more common in the general population compared to those with mental health issues. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the sexual abnormalities and behaviors that are often seen in bipolar female patients. Final thoughts: Sexual dysfunctions and abnormal behaviors were more common in women with BD. Manic episodes are associated with increased hazardous sexual conduct in people with BD. Additionally, it was mentioned that couples' sexual pleasure is negatively impacted by hypersexuality during manic episodes and hyposexuality during depressed episodes, and this effect typically continues into the times between episodes. On the other hand, sex may be linked to negative emotions rather than diminished desire during depressed periods. Individuals with mental health illnesses have a greater chance of sexual difficulties damaging personal interactions and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "#### The bottom line\n\nDelusional infestation (previously also known as delusional parasitosis or Ekbom’s syndrome) is a rare disorder, but it commonly poses disproportionate practical problems to healthcare systems.1 It is characterised by a patient’s fixed belief that his or her skin, body, or immediate environment is infested by small, living (or less often inanimate) pathogens despite the lack of any medical evidence for this.1 Delusional infestation is neither a single disease nor a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Suicide is a traumatic event for close relatives due to various factors, with bullying acting as a mediator. Bullying has been identified as a primary predictor of suicidal ideation and a contributing factor to suicide. Objective: This study aims to describe the pathway from bullying victimization to suicidal attempts in adolescents. Results: Adolescence is a period of peak physical health and a time of behavioral and emotional problems due to developmental factors, which can increase susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Adolescents who experience bullying report suicidal ideation more frequently, often on a weekly basis, due to psychiatric morbidity (OR = 7.78). The relationship between bullying and suicide is mediated by poor physical and mental health, especially among victims. Bullying victimization triggers psychological or behavioral problems that can lead to suicidal behavior, often mediated by mental health or psychological problems, such as internalization or substance use which serve as maladaptive coping strategies, with suicide ultimately becoming a final coping strategy. Conclusion: Psychological or mental health problems mediate the risk of suicidal attempts among bullied adolescents, although other pathways may also be involved.",

      "title": "Secondary Mania in Older Adults: a case report and review of literature",
      "abstract": "Introduction Although mania is commonly associated with bipolar disorder, it can have many etiologies. Thus, “primary mania” results from bipolar disorder, whereas “secondary mania” results from pharmacological, metabolic, or neurologic causes. Older adults are at risk for secondary mania because of increased medical comorbidities and neurological changes. In one retrospective study of 50 patients with mania who were older than 65 years, it was the first manic episode for 28% of the patients and 71% had a comorbid neurological disorder. Objectives The etiology of mania is important because although acute symptomatic treatment of both primary and secondary mania may be similar, appropriate treatment of secondary mania includes addressing the cause. We present here two case histories of secondary mania in older adults, discuss their presentations and differential diagnosis in turn, and discuss treatment. Methods We will present a clinical case of a patient. Ms. A, a 63-year-old divorced woman with no prior medical or psychiatric history, was seen for an acute manic episode with mixed features. She was in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before admission, when she presented with a status epilepticus requiring a one-week hospitalization in the neurology département and treated by Carbamazepine. She then developed an abnormally excited and labile mood, motor excitability accompanied by rapid thoughts, with a total loss of desire and pleasure and thoughts of death. Results In our study, the patient presented a manic episode with mixed characteristics secondary to a status epilepticus. The patient was treated both somatically and psychologically, and the evolution was positive. The patient was stabilised after being put on an antiepileptic drug associated with an antipsychotic drug. In our study, the patient presented with a manic attack with mixed characteristics secondary to a status epilepticus.The patient was treated both somatically and psychologically, and the evolution was favourable. The patient was stabilised after being put on an antiepileptic drug associated with an antipsychotic drug. Conclusions Late onset psychiatric disorders often represent a challenge for the psychiatrists as far as the diagnosis and management issues are concerned. The elderly patients have generally been reported to have associated medical, especially neurological illnesses and are also prone to side effects of various psychotropic medications.

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

A fearful experience can also lead to avoidant reactions due to raised negative emotions in situations similar to that, which evoked the fear. To analyse children's reactions after anaesthesia to anaesthetic play equipment, 49 children (three-six years old) were video-filmed during play with anaesthetic equipment 14 days after anaesthesia and surgery. The risk that the child avoided playing with anaesthetic equipment was increased if the child took the premedication unwillingly and if the child was younger. The risk for not telling about the experience was increased if the child took the premedication unwillingly and if the child showed signs of shyness. The risk for telling mostly unspecific memories increased if the child was younger and if the child showed signs of shyness. Avoidant reactions could bee seen in 50 percent of the children. It is important to be aware of the characteristics of a vulnerable child (age, shyness) and to meet the child without raising negative emotions in any part of the anaesthetic process, in order to avoid negative reactions in future encounters.",

      "title": "Hallucinations in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "Abstract Hallucinations are a common symptom in paediatric populations, which can be a transitory phenomenon but which can also constitute a serious cause of concern since it may be a sign of physical or mental illness. Available studies in the literature effectively established that hallucinations and delusions may occur in both clinical (neurological, psychiatric, or other pathologies) and non-clinical (i.e., normal) individuals, leading some authors to question the diagnostic specificity of these experiences during childhood (Larøi et al., 2006). It is important to mention that ‘non-diagnostic hallucinations’ can constitute normal features of child development related to psychological immaturity (Schreier, 1998; Sosland & Edelsohn, 2005; Edelsohn, 2006), and it seems most appropriate to first consider hallucinations as non-specific symptoms. In this way, much attention has to be drawn to the child's global clinical presentation and his/her social and familial context. Later on in the text, we will discuss that hallucinations may also be a symptom of psychosis or future emergence of the pathology. However, since early-onset psychosis is often difficult to diagnose, the question of whether to treat and how to treat remain debatable topics. Some authors proposed that since the diagnosis-specificity longitudinally improves, time and clinical evolution constitute the best diagnostic tools (Jeammet, 2000). Various clinical presentations may be characterized by disturbances in thinking and perception that are not clearly psychotic, accompanied by non-specific conduct disorders, such as recent, abrupt, or more insidious changes in sleeping, eating, global behaviour, or mood. A first prodromal period may last several years with non-specific signs such as deteriorating academic and social performance, emerging conduct problems, including delinquency and substance misuse or abuse, and pseudo-neurotic disorders (Biderman et al., 2004). In such prodromal cases, early treatment has been shown to be associated with better prognosis (McGorry et al., 2002; Yung et al., 2005). The non-identification of this syndrome can have devastating consequences, but on the other hand, systematic medication of children with hallucinations using anti-psychotic drugs in the emergency setting should be avoided until a complete exploration has been performed. Clinicians need to be aware of the wide range of differential etiological diagnoses, including medical (mainly metabolic and neurological), or psychiatric ones (schizotypy, schizophreniform disorders, early onset schizophrenia, mood disorders, traumatic life events such as sexual abuse, bereavement, bullying, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other anxiety disorders, ADHD). Adequate explorations, monitoring, and therapeutic guidelines for hallucinatory experiences in children and adolescents will be considered in more detail.",

However, research does not unanimously support the prior existence of severe depressive or anxiety disorders as a usual cause of alcoholism. A review of recent literature (from family studies, prospective investigations, and studies of children of alcoholics) on the complex interaction between alcohol dependence and independent anxiety/depressive disorders reveals that if an association between alcoholism and anxiety/depressive disorders does exist, it likely operates in a relatively small subgroup of alcoholics at the same time.

A single pathogenetic pathway does not exist for sexual disorders generally and that is also true for DE specifically. Men with DE have various bio-psychosocial-behavioral & cultural predisposing, precipitating, maintaining, and contextual factors which trigger, reinforce, or worsen the probability of DE occurring. Regardless of the degree of organic etiology present, DE is exacerbated by insufficient stimulation: an inadequate combination of \"friction and fantasy\". High frequency negative thoughts may neutralize erotic cognitions (fantasy) and subsequently delay, ameliorate, or inhibit ejaculation, while partner stimulation (friction) may prove unsatisfying. Assessment requires a thorough sexual history including inquiry into masturbatory methods. Many men with DE engage in an idiosyncratic masturbatory style, defined as a masturbation technique not easily duplicated by the partner's hand, mouth, or vagina. The clinician's most valuable diagnostic tool is a focused sex history (sex status). Differentiate DE from other sexual problems and review the conditions under which the man can ejaculate. Perceived partner attractiveness, the use of fantasy during sex, anxiety-surrounding coitus and masturbatory patterns require meticulous exploration. Identify important DE causes by juxtaposing an awareness of his cognitions and the sexual stimulation experienced during masturbation, versus a partnered experience. Assist the man in identifying behaviors that enhance immersion in excitation and minimize inhibiting thoughts, in order to reach ejaculation in his preferred manner. Discontinuing, reducing or altering masturbation is often required, which evokes patient resistance. Coaching tips are offered on how to ensure adherence to this suspension, manage resistance and facilitate success. Depending on motivation level, masturbation interruption may be compromised and negotiated. Encourage a man who continues to masturbate to alter style (\"switch hands\") and to approximate the stimulation likely to be experienced with his partner. Success will require most men to be taught to learn bodily movements and fantasies that approximate the thoughts and sensations experienced in masturbation. Fertility issues, as well as patient/partner anger are important causational factors, which often require individual and/or conjoint consultation. Drug treatment would benefit men particularly with severe DE, regardless of concomitant psychosocial-behavioral and cultural complications. When and if a safe effective medication for DE becomes available, this author's transdisciplinary perspective supports appropriate medication use when integrated with counseling. This approach emphasizes the utility of a biopsychosocial-cultural perspective combined with special attention to the patient's narrative. Treatment is patient-centered, holistic and integrates a variety of therapies as needed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mental health issues are a common cause of psychosocial distress in men over the age of 55, and are a common cause of disability due to problems of disturbance of mood, substance use issues, and cognitive difficulties. The physician's ongoing relationship with the older male patient is highly personal and enables the clinician to key in on events and changes in his life that may predispose to mental illness. Doctors have the opportunity to reduce long-term disability and suffering caused by mental and emotional distress through early recognition and anticipation of common mental health problems.",

      "title": "Neuropathic Orofacial Pain Part 1‐Prevalence And Pathophysiology",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is defined as \"pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system\". Neuropathic orofacial pain has previously been known as \"atypical odontalgia\" (AO) and \"phantom tooth pain\". The patient afflicted with neuropathic oral/orofacial pain may present to the dentist with a persistent, severe pain, yet there are no clearly identifiable clinical or radiographic abnormalities. Accordingly, multiple endodontic procedures may be instigated to remove the likely anatomical source of the pain, yet the pain persists. There have been few studies and limited patient numbers investigating the condition. Two retrospective studies revealed the incidence of persistent pain following endodontic treatment to be 3-6% and 5% of patients; one author with wide experience in assessing the condition estimated its prevalence at 125,000 individuals in the USA alone. In one study, 50% of neuropathic orofacial pain patients reported persistent pain specifically following endodontic treatment. Patients predisposed to the condition may include those suffering from recurrent cluster or migraine headaches. Neuropathic pain states include postherpetic neuralgia (shingles) and phantom limb/stump pain. The aberrant developmental neurobiology leading to this pain state is complex. Neuropathic pain serves no protective function, in contrast to physiological pain that warns of noxious stimuli likely to result in tissue damage. The relevant clinical features of neuropathic pain include: (i) precipitating factors such as trauma or disease (infection), and often a delay in onset after initial injury (days-months), (ii) typical complaints such as dysaesthesias (abnormal unpleasant sensations), pain that may include burning, and paroxysmal, lancinating or sharp qualities, and pain in an area of sensory deficit, (iii) on physical examination there may be hyperalgesia, allodynia and sympathetic hyperfunction, and (iv) the pathophysiology includes deafferentation, nerve sprouting, neuroma formation and sympathetic efferent activity.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms in later life",
      "abstract": "Het onderzoek in dit proefschrift is voortgekomen uit ervaringen in de klinische praktijk. Ouderen presenteren zich regelmatig met lichamelijke klachten zonder dat er bij uitvoerig lichamelijk onderzoek lichamelijke oorzaken worden gevonden die deze klachten volledig kunnen verklaren. Ouderen richten zich met deze klachten vaak in eerste instantie tot de huisarts of een somatisch georienteerde specialist. Wanneer deze geen afwijkingen vindt, zijn oudere patienten moeilijk te motiveren psychologische aspecten nader te laten onderzoeken door een psychiater of psycholoog. Patienten ervaren een dergelijke doorverwijzing vaak als een afwijzing. Om dit probleem het hoofd te bieden is er een polikliniek opgericht voor onderzoek en behandeling van Somatisch Onvoldoende verklaarde Lichamelijke Klachten (SOLK) bij ouderen in Nijmegen waar patienten achtereenvolgens worden gezien door klinisch geriater, psychiater en psycholoog. Onze kennis over SOLK is nagenoeg volledig gebaseerd op onderzoek bij jongere volwassenen. Zo weten we dat SOLK bij deze leeftijdsgroep veel voorkomen: tussen 30-50% van de klachten waarvoor patienten hun huisarts bezoeken zijn klachten zonder duidelijke lichamelijke oorzaak. Als de klachten aanhouden en patienten hulp blijven zoeken, kan dat frustraties opleveren voor zowel patienten als hulpverleners. Mensen met SOLK ervaren vaak een hoge lijdensdruk en rapporteren vaak een lage kwaliteit van leven. Tevens is er een hoge co-morbiditeit met depressie en angstproblemen. In hoeverre SOLK voorkomen bij ouderen en hoe dit samenhangt met de kwaliteit van leven voor ouderen is nauwelijks bekend. In hoofdstuk 1 illustreren we drie oudere patienten die de specifieke problemen bij SOLK op latere leeftijd goed weergeven. Vermoedelijk dat juist deze specifieke problemen bijdragen aan de geringe aandacht voor SOLK in deze leeftijdsgroep. Voorbeeld 1 betreft een 75 jarige vrouw met pijn aan haar benen. Diverse medisch specialisten vonden geen oorzaak voor haar klachten; de medische verslaglegging spreekt over “leeftijd gerelateerde klachten” of “slijtage”. De huisarts dacht vervolgens aan een (gemaskeerde) depressie, maar behandeling hierop gericht sloeg niet aan. Hierop werd zij verwezen naar onze polikliniek in verband met onverklaarde pijn aan haar benen. Bij aanvullend onderzoek door de klinisch geriater werd alsnog een lichamelijke oorzaak gevonden, namelijk een vernauwing van haar wervelkanaal. Dit voorbeeld illustreert hoe moeilijk het is om verklaarde en onverklaarde klachten bij ouderen uit elkaar te houden. Met enige regelmaat worden lichamelijke klachten ten onrechte aan normale veroudering toegewezen. Voorbeeld 2 betreft een 75-jarige vrouw met langdurige maag- en darmklachten. Zij is tevens bekend met recidiverende, depressieve stemmingen. Ondanks verschillende behandelingen door zowel een psychiater als door internist en gynaecoloog blijven de klachten bestaan. Op onze polikliniek stellen we een depressieve stoornis vast. Wanneer we deze strak volgens de richtlijnen behandelen verbetert niet alleen haar stemming, maar verdwijnen ook haar de lichamelijke klachten. Dit voorbeeld geeft aan dat depressies en SOLK nauw met elkaar zijn verweven op latere leeftijd en soms moeilijk uit elkaar te houden zijn.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria. Se recomienda una combinacion de 5 a 10 mgs de haloperidol mas 4 mgs de lorazepam por via intramuscular cada 30 minutos. El registro del grado de agitacion en una escala de 100 puntos, proporciona la retroalimentacion necesaria para proseguir, revalorar, o concluir el tratamiento, dependiendo de los resultados obtenidos. Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Onset of genetically determined neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to specify because of their insidious and slowly progressive nature. This is especially true for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) because of varying affection of many parts of the nervous system and huge variability of symptoms. We investigated early symptoms in 287 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and calculated the influence of CAG repeat length on age of onset depending on (1) the definition of disease onset, (2) people defining onset, and (3) duration of symptoms. Gait difficulty was the initial symptom in two‐thirds of patients. Double vision, dysarthria, impaired hand writing, and episodic vertigo preceded ataxia in 4% of patients, respectively. Frequency of other early symptoms did not differ from controls and was regarded unspecific. Data about disease onset varied between patients and relatives for 1 year or more in 44% of cases. Influence of repeat length on age of onset was maximum when onset was defined as beginning of permanent gait disturbance and cases with symptoms for more than 10 years were excluded. Under these conditions, CAG repeat length determined 64% of onset variability in SCA1, 67% in SCA2, 46% in SCA3, and 41% in SCA6 demonstrating substantial influence of nonrepeat factors on disease onset in all SCA subtypes. Identification of these factors is of interest as potential targets for disease modifying compounds. In this respect, recognition of early symptoms that develop before onset of ataxia is mandatory to determine the shift from presymptomatic to affected status in SCA. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",

      "title": "Glycogen Storage Disease Type V",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Glycogen storage disease type V (GSDV, McArdle disease) is a metabolic myopathy characterized by exercise intolerance manifested by rapid fatigue, myalgia, and cramps in exercising muscles. Symptoms are usually precipitated by isometric exercise or sustained aerobic exercise. Most individuals improve their exercise tolerance by exploiting the second-wind phenomenon with relief of myalgia and fatigue after a few minutes of rest. Age of onset is frequently in the first decade of life but can vary; however, diagnosis is typically delayed as myalgia and fatigability are dismissed/overlooked. Fixed muscle weakness occurs in approximately 25% of affected individuals, is more likely to involve proximal muscles, and is more common in individuals of advanced age. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have recurrent episodes of myoglobinuria that can – on occasion – eventually result in acute renal failure. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GSDV is established in a proband with suggestive findings and by identification of biallelic PYGM (encoding glycogen phosphorylase, muscle form) pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing or – if genetic test results are not diagnostic – by assay of muscle myophosphorylase enzyme activity. Management Treatment of manifestations: Although no cure for GSDV is available, affected individuals benefit from moderate-intensity aerobic training (e.g., walking or brisk walking, bicycling) to increase cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle oxidative capacity. Pre-exercise ingestion of sports drinks containing simple carbohydrates improves exercise tolerance and may protect against exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis. Surveillance: Annual routine physical examination and review of diet. Agents/circumstances to avoid: To prevent occurrence of cramps and myoglobinuria, avoid intense isometric exercise and maximal aerobic exercise. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When the family-specific PYGM pathogenic variants are known, early detection of GSDV in relatives at risk ensures proper management to prevent muscle injury leading to rhabdomyolysis and to improve long-term outcome, particularly by development of a healthy lifestyle (i.e., regular exercise such as brisk walking) in childhood. Genetic counseling GSDV is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Once the pathogenic variants in the family are known, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Anabolic-androgenic steroids, synthetic progestins, and antiepileptics are the most frequently implicated drugs in hyperandrogenism. The mechanisms of androgen excess are various: (1) intrinsic androgenic activity of the drug, (2) interaction with sex hormone-binding globulin, or (3) functional alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovary axis. Nevertheless, the physiology of these drugs remains generally unclear. Such is the case for valproate, which seems to induce a form of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by increasing ovarian androgen synthesis. It should be remembered that it is always necessary to rule out other causes of androgen excess, especially an ovarian or adrenal tumor or PCOS, before attributing the symptom(s) to a drug.",

There are many physiological processes and behaviours which are initiated or accentuated in relation to sleep and these occur in many people of all ages. Unfortunately, when medical advice is sought for such events, considerable confusion seems to exist about their precise diagnosis and about their psychological or physical significance. These diagnostic uncertainties are often the result of insufficiently detailed descriptions and a general lack of awareness of the many different types of nocturnal disturbance. Uncertainty about the possible significance of the episodes is largely the result of inadequate research.",

      "abstract": "Collusion is a mostly unconscious phenomenon occurring in the therapeutic relationship, which can be commonly identified in psychiatry but more generally in medicine. Collusion is especially present in circumstances in which the effects of disease and its treatments have a heavy impact on patients and caregivers, and where the stakes are existential. Collusion is triggered by unresolved psychological problems, for example, loss, intimacy or control, which are shared by the patient and the clinician. Collusion, if unrecognized, can seriously hamper the clinician-patient relationship and the care of the patient.La collusion est un phénomène inconscient survenant dans la relation thérapeutique, observable en psychiatrie, mais aussi en médecine. Elle se manifeste surtout dans les domaines où les effets de la maladie et des traitements pèsent lourdement sur les patients et les cliniciens et où les enjeux sont existentiels. L’origine d’une collusion se situe dans des problèmes psychologiques non résolus, en lien avec des thématiques comme la perte, l’intimité ou le contrôle, qui sont partagés par le clinicien et son patient. La collusion, si elle n’est pas reconnue, peut sérieusement entraver la relation clinique et avoir des conséquences négatives sur la prise en charge.",

It is important to distinguish these from the symptoms of an ongoing or latent medical or psychiatric condition that are magnified in the premenstrual period. A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness. The complex downstream effects of cycling estrogen and progesterone are believed to account for the multitude of possible manifestations of these disorders as well as for the exacerbation of certain medical and psychiatric conditions in relation to the menstrual cycle.",

      "abstract": "Effective interventions are available, but the condition remains underdiagnosed \n\nMajor depressive episodes after childbirth are referred to as postnatal depression or, in the United States, as postpartum depression. During the first six months after delivery the prevalence of major depression is estimated at 12-13%.w1 The precise time frame for defining postnatal depression has varied across studies, typically from one month to one year after childbirth. In an effort to standardise the terminology, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition, restricted the specifier of postpartum onset to depressive episodes occurring within four weeks of delivery. However, most studies of postnatal depression have continued to use wider time frames, in part because epidemiological studies show that women's heightened vulnerability to depression continues for at least the first six months after childbirth. Postnatal depression must be distinguished from postnatal blues (“baby blues”), a common experience following childbirth, in which new mothers experience lability of mood and tearfulness. This mild and self limiting condition typically disappears two weeks after delivery.\n\nUnfortunately postnatal depression is often overlooked in primary care clinics. In a study of 214 women who brought their children to a general paediatric clinic, 86 reported high levels of depressive symptoms on the psychiatric symptom index. Of these women, only 29% were identified as depressed by the paediatricians.1 The mother's suffering, coupled with the burden that her depression …",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

      "title": "Unexpected emergence from the vegetative state: delayed discovery rather than late recovery of consciousness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background The vegetative state, also known as the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, is one of the worst possible outcomes of acquired brain injury and confronts rehabilitation specialists with various challenges. Emergence to (minimal) consciousness is classically considered unlikely beyond 3–6 months after non-traumatic or 12 months after traumatic etiologies. A growing body of evidence suggests that these timeframes are too narrow, but evidence regarding chances of recovery is still limited. Objective To identify the moment of recovery of consciousness in documented cases of late emergence from a vegetative state. Methods Four cases of apparent late recovery of consciousness, identified within a prospective cohort study, were studied in-depth by analyzing medical, paramedical and nursing files and interviewing the patients’ families about their account of the process of recovery. Results All patients were found to have shown signs of consciousness well within the expected time frame (5 weeks–2 months post-ictus). These behaviors, however, went unnoticed or were misinterpreted, leading to a diagnostic delay of several months to over 5 years. Absence of appropriate diagnostics, the use of erroneous terminology, sedative medication but also patient-related factors such as hydrocephalus, language barriers and performance fluctuations are hypothesized to have contributed to the delay. Conclusions Delayed recognition of signs of consciousness in patients in a vegetative state may not only lead to suboptimal clinical care, but also to distorted prognostic figures. Discriminating late recovery from the delayed discovery of consciousness, therefore, is vital to both clinical practice and science.",

These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis canbe difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially,he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and internal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active temporal focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously.

Of those who do have further seizures (i.e., who develop epilepsy), 65-85 per cent eventually become free from seizures, and many of them are able to cease antiepileptic medication. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder. The larger proportion of patients who are otherwise healthy, and who respond readily to antiepileptic treatment and manifest no side effects or only mild ones, are characterised by the best prognosis and are able to terminate treatment within 2-5 years without recurrence. At the other extreme is the smaller group of patients with onset of epilepsy very early in life, and characterised by multiple severe neurological defects, severe daily seizures, resistance (more or less) to all available treatment, and high mortality. In many cases of epilepsy, however, severity and prognosis lie somewhere between these two extremes.",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "title": "The Phenomenology of Depressive States",
      "abstract": "Résumé1. Une étude des données épidémiologiques met en lumière le rapport qui existe entre les formes plus graves des états dépressifs et la fin de l'âge mûr la vieillesse et la feminité.2. L'expérience acquise grâce aux traitements physiques utilisés en psychiatrie au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années confirme dans l'ensemble l'existence de deux types comparativement distincts d'état dépressif, l'un basé sur une prédisposition spécifique, l'autre sur une vulnérabilité générale vis-à-vis de laquelle les individus ne diffèrent qu'au point de vue du degré. Ces deux groupes diffèrent quant à leur image clinique—son inconstance et ses conséquences aussi bien que par le type de prédisposition—plutôt que par la présence ou l'absence de causes environnantes de la maladie.3. Le rapport entre les états anxieux et les états dépressifs est discuté avec mention particulière d'un nouveau syndrome qui habituellement se manifeste tout à coup après un malheur ou une grave maladie physique. Ce dérangement est plus fréquent chez les femmes qui auraient tendance à être rigides et dépendantes d'autrui. Le noyau même de la maladie est une dépersonnalisation qui se combine avec une forme caractérisée de phobie anxieuse; cette combinaison se trouve accompagnée de symptômes plus variables de dépression, d'obsession, d'hystérie, d'hypocondrie et parfois de psychose de courte durée. Les symptômes de dépression peuvent être plus évidents particulièrement chez des malades plus âgées—mais un traitement d'électrochoc ne fait habituellement qu'aggraver la maladie. On considère que les faits connus sont à l'encontre du concept d'une seule et unique famille des maladies affectives où les différents types de réactions se fondraient insensiblement les uns dans les autres.4. Les observations récentes ne confirment pas le concept d'un état dépressif d'un type spécifiquement involutif. Mais des preuves permettraient de suggérer que ceux qui passent par un état dépressif pour la première fois à un âge avancé sont moins prédisposés de naissance aux dépressions nerveuses que ceux dont la maladie s'est révélée quand ils étaient plus jeunes. Dans le premier cas une force exogène est le point de départ le plus fréquent et la dépression se complique souvent de troubles physiques, particulièrement chez les hommes.5. Le rapport qui existe entre d'infimes altérations de la conscience et certaines formes de réactions dépressives est discuté en se basant particulièrement sur les psychoses 'psychogènes', les états dits 'schizophréniformes', les psychoses des épileptiques et des alcooliques et les symptômes affectifs associés avec les maladies somatiques aiguës.6. Discussion du rapport qui existe entre les symptômes d'hypocondrie et d'ob-session et les états dépressifs. Plus les symptômes précédents seront prononcés en relation avec l'état dépressif, plus le cours de la maladie et la réaction au traitement seront éloignés de ceux de la dépression endogène. Il est suggéré que l'hypocondrie existe en tant que telle aussi bien qu'en tant de symptôme d'un état dépressif. Description de quelques formes cliniques de cette maladie.7. Les états de dépression sont parmi les plus communs des maux humains. L'incidence morbide des seuls cas endogènes est d'environ 1–2%, ce qui implique une plus grande fréquence que pour toute autre maladie provoquée par un mécanisme génétique spécifique. L'auteur met ces faits en relation avec la psychopathologie et avec la signification biologique des états dépressifs.",

      "abstract": "Of 842 consecutive patients with movement disorders seen over a 71 month period, 28 (3.3%) were diagnosed as having a documented or clinically established psychogenic movement disorder. Tremor was most common (50%) followed by dystonia, myoclonus, and parkinsonism. Clinical descriptions of various types are reviewed. Clinical characteristics common in these patients included distractability (86%), abrupt onset (54%), and selective disabilities (39%). Distractability seems to be most important in tremor and least important in dystonia. Other diagnostic clues included entrainment of tremor to the frequency of repetitive movements of another limb, fatigue of tremor, stimulus sensitivity, and previous history of psychogenic illness. On examination, 71% had other psychogenic features. Over 60% had a clear history of a precipitating event and secondary gain and 50% had a psychiatric diagnosis (usually depression). Twenty five per cent of patients presented with combined psychogenic movement disorder and organic movement disorder; 35% resolved and this subgroup had a shorter duration of disease than those who are unresolved. Psychogenic movement disorder represents an uncommon diagnosis among patients with movement disorders. The ability to make a diagnosis rests on the presence of a multitude of clinical clues and therapeutic action should be taken as early as possible.",

      "abstract": "Oral food challenges still remain the gold standard in the diagnosis of food related symptoms and are performed to obtain a clear “yes or no” response. However, this is often difficult to achieve, and so proposals may be appropriate for criteria on when to stop oral food challenges and declare a challenge as positive or negative. In daily practice it makes sense to challenge until clear objective symptoms occur without harming the patient. Clinical symptoms should be objective and/or: (a) severe or (b) reproducible or (c) persisting. A sensitive parameter for a beginning clinical reaction is a general change of mood. The sooner symptoms appear, the more likely they are to represent a “true” positive reaction, and the more organ systems are involved the easier it is to assess an oral food challenge as positive. In the case of subjective symptoms, the number of placebo doses should be increased. In unclear situations, the observation time until the next dose should be prolonged or the same dose repeated. Transient objective clinical symptoms usually end up in a positive challenge result. There are a number of causes for false positive and false negative challenge results, which should be considered. The aim of all oral challenge testing should be to hold the balance between two conflicting aspects: on the one hand the need to achieve clear and justified results from oral food challenges in order to avoid unnecessary diets, and on the other hand to protect patients from any harm caused by high doses of a potentially dangerous food.",

      "abstract": "The concept of multiple organ failure dates back to the 1970s,1 but it has recently been redefined as “the progressive (and sometimes sequential) dysfunction of physiologic systems in the presence of a clinical picture of systemic sepsis.”2 Multiple organ failure is often caused by the “systemic inflammatory response syndrome” (SIRS).3 A patient who has been severely injured and has survived initial resuscitation may develop the features of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and may then deteriorate with features of multiple organ failure, which is often fatal. Despite an enormous amount of experimental and clinical research, a definitive, all encompassing theory accounting for the link between trauma and multiple organ failure has not yet emerged.\n\nTwenty years ago few people doubted the link with infection. The belief was that trauma led to multiple organ failure as a result of unsuspected or uncontrolled infection, and an intra-abdominal abscess4 was most frequently incriminated as the trigger. The adverse clinical course usually started with the acute respiratory distress syndrome and led to the patient's death despite intensive system support.

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient.

When an individual is extremely relaxed a sudden loud stimulus causes little or no start and seems to lose its irritating character; while the same kind of stimulus, when an individual is in a state of muscular tenseness, will bring about a start and very considerable muscular contraction.

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

It rarely occurs in Postpartum Psychosis. An intriguing phenomenon with ongoing debates, particularly about its feature and prevalence, its course, occurrence, and phenomenon in the postpartum period are poorly understood. Case presentation A 26-year-old Nepalese woman presented to the emergency for abnormal behavior on her 9th postpartum day. Capgras delusion was observed for 2 days during her hospital stay. Other psychotic symptoms appeared progressively and were treated as a case of Postpartum Psychosis. Conclusion This case describes the temporal sequence of various psychopathologies during Postpartum Psychosis including Capgras delusion. We attempt to explain the occurrence of Capgras delusion in Postpartum Psychosis.",

      "title": "Confusional status epilepticus in elderly",
      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

Pada intinya, jet lag merupakan akibat dari ketidaksesuaian yang terjadi setelah melewati daerah dengan waktu yang terlalu cepat. Jet lag memiliki ciri ketidaksesuaian yang sementara antara endogen sirkardian tidur/bangun dan lingkungan fisik eksternal yang mengarah pada perubahan waktu.

Historically, childlessness has always been recognised as a problem, whether as a misfortune or even as an offence (Carr 1963). Likewise, it has long been suspected that infertility may, in some cases, have a psychogenic basis. The question of the relationship between psychological variables and infertility is nevertheless a complex one, and the literature, although extensive, is speculative, anecdotal and contradictory. Few studies meet adequate methodological standards. Nevertheless, any consideration of the relevance of psychological factors to infertility management must address the question of psychogenic infertility.",

Three clinical examples are presented in which PRU appears as: (1) malingering; (2) an upper motor lesion inducing spastic closure of the bladder neck, and (3) an alteration of the sensory input, closely resembling sensory neuron damage. The urologist becomes involved in the treatment of these patients by the natural expression of the symptoms. The underlying psychogenic factor does not become evident until urodynamic investigations and often specific therapeutic steps have been undertaken. The urologic treatment sometimes appears helpful because the patients do not realise or refuse to accept the idea of a psychogenic cause and expect relief from the urologist. The latter should withdraw his involvement as soon as an organic cause has been excluded.",

Einleitend wird auf die Sorgfaltspflicht eines Lenkers verwiesen. Jeder Kraftfahrer hat sich vor der Inbetriebnahme eines Fahrzeuges stets zu vergewissern, dass er nach seinen koerperlichen und geistigen Faehigkeiten dazu (noch) imstande ist, den Anforderungen des Strassenverkehrs zu genuegen. Wirkungen oder Nebenwirkungen von Medikamenten koennen eine Reihe von physischen oder psychischen Stoerungen verursachen, welche die Verkehrstauglichkeit herabsetzen. Als verkehrsmedizinisch relevant muessen alle Pharmaka gelten, die einen zentralen Angriffspunkt haben. Die Wirkungen der in Betracht kommenden Medikamente haengen jedoch von verschiedensten Faktoren und der individuellen Situation des Betroffenen ab. Prinzipiell ist zu sagen, dass eine medikamentenbedingte Fahruntuechtigkeit ein normatives Tatbestandsmerkmal ist, dem ein vorsaetzliches oder fahrlaessiges Verhalten zugrunde liegen kann. Die rechtliche Entscheidung ueber die Verschuldensfrage und die Schuldform haengt davon ab, ob und gegebenenfalls wie der betroffene Lenker vor oder waehrend der Fahrt die Wirkung der konsumierten Medikamente im Hinblick auf seine Fahrsicherheit beurteilt hat und beurteilen musste. Da jeder Fahrzeuglenker vor Antritt der Fahrt verpflichtet ist, seine Fahrtuechtigkeit zu pruefen, handelt er im Falle einer mangelnden eigenen Vorsorge fahrlaessig. Auf die verschiedenen Moeglichkeiten eines Kraftfahrers, eine Fahruntuechtigkeit vorauszusehen, wird eingegangen. Ein Kraftfahrer, der sich gegen aerztlichen Rat nach Einnahme eines Medikamentes ans Steuer setzt, handelt schuldhaft. Der Autor geht weiters auf Arzneimittelinteraktionen bei Einnahme von 2 oder mehreren Medikamenten gleichzeitig, auf das Zusammenwirken von Medikamenten und Alkohol sowie auf alkoholhaltige Medikamente und die im jeweiligen Fall zu erfuellenden Sorgfaltspflichten des Lenkers ein.

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

These sensory manifestations may include the element of pain, but usually they are not confined to a single somatic segment or focal visceral area. Localized pain, as an isolated phenomenon not associated with somatic convulsive seizures or with other motor, sensory or psychic variants of epilepsy would rarely be considered a form of epilepsy even though its occurrence was episodic and paroxysmal.

      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "abstract": "The sexual dysfunctions are extremely common but are rarely recognized by primary care physicians. They represent inhibitions in the appetitive or psychophysiologic changes that characterize the complete adult sexual response and are classified into four major categories: (1) sexual desire disorders (hypoactive sexual desire, sexual aversion disorder), (2) sexual arousal disorders (female sexual arousal disorder, male erectile dysfunction), (3) orgasmic disorders (inhibited male or female orgasm, premature ejaculation), and (4) sexual pain disorders (dyspareunia, vaginismus).Articles about the sexual dysfunctions were obtained from a search of MEDLINE files from 1966 to the present using the categories as key words, along with the general key word \"sexual dysfunction.\" Additional articles came from the reference lists of dysfunction-specific reviews.Cause and pathogenesis span a continuum from organic to psychogenic and most often include a mosaic of factors. Organic factors include chronic illness, pregnancy, pharmacologic agents, endocrine alterations, and a host of other medical, surgical, and traumatic factors. Psychogenic factors include an array of individual factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, fear, frustration, guilt hypochondria, intrapsychic conflict), interpersonal and relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, relationship conflict, diminished trust, fear of intimacy, poor relationship models, family system conflict), psychosexual factors (e.g., negative learning and attitudes, performance anxiety, prior sexual trauma, restrictive religiosity, intellectual defenses), and sexual enactment factors (e.g., skill and knowledge deficits, unrealistic performance expectations). Understanding the cause and pathophysiology of sexual disorders will help primary care physicians diagnose these problems accurately and manage them effectively.",

Stroke 2016;47:2203–8.\n\nDepression may be a direct cause of stroke.1 Alternatively, an observed association between depression and stroke may be generated by indirect processes when depression is not the immediate cause.1 Thus, depression, particularly if chronic or recurrent, could act as an upstream influence leading to increased stroke risk via intervening behaviours linked with low motivation such as smoking and lack of exercise. Further, a depression–stroke association could be spurious. A non-causal explanation likely accounted for findings from 24-year follow-up of the Whitehall II cohort.1 Depressive symptoms were linked robustly to the incidence of major acute coronary events, but the association with stroke was limited to the 5-year period after psychological assessment. Depression may thus be a prodromal symptom of stroke, perhaps of vascular origin, generated by subclinical changes to the brain before the …",

Symptoms commonly include hallucinations, mostly of the auditory type, and affective disturbances, in a background of clear consciousness. In this case series, four subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption were evaluated for hallucinatory symptoms after chronic alcohol intake. All of them had auditory hallucinations, with an anxious affect and no cognitive deficits. Only one case had visual hallucinations. The psychotic symptoms in all the patients were completely remitted with antipsychotics. Resumption of alcohol consumption increases the risk of relapse. The pathophysiology of alcoholic hallucinosis is not yet established and needs to be studied further for better diagnosis and management.",

Patients with addictive disorders frequently experience sexual dysfunctions and chronic use of substances tends to adversely affect all stages of sexual response, in both male and female abusers. An important aspect in the management of sexual dysfunction is psychosocial intervention. In addictive disorders, sexual dysfunction is of high clinical relevance, as it often leads to treatment non adherence and sexual or marital disharmony. Instead of a disease-centred approach, a couple and relationship centred approach of management is desirable. A detailed history about the sexual dysfunction, the addictive disorder and enquiry into various psychosocial aspects is mandatory for adequate management of the same. Sexual therapy, behavioural techniques, systematic sensitization and desensitization are some of the techniques used in the management of sexual dysfunction in addictive disorders. The assessment and treatment need to be tailored depending upon the various psychosocial aspects of the individual.",

Childbirth has the strongest relationship with postpartum affective psychosis, a condition that is characterized by an acute onset of florid symptoms, usually within 2 weeks of delivery, and atypical features, such as rapidly fluctuating psychotic symptoms, florid motor symptoms, perplexity and high risks to the mother and her baby. Follow up data of women with a first episode suggest that some women only become ill in the context of childbirth whereas in others it is an expression of a lifelong bipolar disorder. Whether this reflects two distinct forms of the disorder or different degrees of vulnerability requires future study. The profound hormonal and metabolic as well as psychosocial changes in the perinatal period give rise to a number of hypotheses that seek to explain the pathogenesis of postpartum psychosis. Current research findings on biological and psychosocial risk factors will be discussed as well as what is currently known about responses to treatment. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

This may be one of reasons why there exist minute descriptions of hundreds of symptoms and signs of various health disorders whereas the state of health is usually described in more general terms only as if it should not have such a distinct identity of its own as the health disorders do.

Frigidity is an absence or lack of sexual pleasure sometimes to the extent of lack of orgasm. It can be due to fear, unresolved oedipal complex, anger, or depression. Psychotherapy is helpful, with antidepressants if appropriate. Dyspareunia is vaginal pain during sexual relations, and derives from the same types of psychological problems as frigidity. Dysmenorrhea can be related to conscious or unconscious rejection of the role of woman or mother. It is treated by psychotherapy. The sexual problems that are relieved easily by physical techniques or education are minor, while those deep in the personality and sustained by psychological mechanisms are major. Female sexual dysfunctions related to the female role are frigidity, dyspareunia, and vaginismus; those associated with the maternal role are dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, false pregnancy, vomiting in pregnancy, sterility, and sponaneous abortion.",

Associations between sexual dysfunction and depression appears bidirectional, such that either one of these conditions may trigger or worsen the other, while improvement in one may also improve the other. This chapter examines the complex relationship between depression and male and female sexual dysfunctions. We explore the classification and prevalence of sexual dysfunction, the known interconnections involving neurobiology, and psychological issues.

      "abstract": "Physiological Background of Muscular Pain During Skiing and Delayed Muscle Soreness after Skiing During intensive skiing, at each turn, in particular towards the end of the turning steering phase, eccentric work of the lower limb muscles occurs (predominantly of the quadriceps femoris), which is the direct cause of damage within muscle cells. A few or more than ten hours after intensive physical effort the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness may appear, which is mainly a result of the micro-damage within the myocytes. The following procedure can be proposed for prevention of muscle soreness for skiers: around a week before first day of skiing in the season, skiers should perform a series of intensive physical exercises involving eccentric contractions, thus inducing delayed muscular soreness. The exercises may involve for example: downhill running, preferably down a steep slope, running down stairs, deep knee bend jumps, deep knee bend jumps over an obstacle, jumping to the ground from a certain height, sit-ups on one or both feet, etc. The exercises should lead considerable local fatigue, in particular of the lower limb muscles, so that muscle soreness occurs on the second day, in particular in the frontal part of the thighs. After approximately two days the pain will alleviate, while after a week the strength of the muscles will return to its pre-exercise condition. This should considerably reduce, or even remove, delayed muscle soreness after skiing, which will not only help skiers use their time more effectively but will also be crucial to the skiers' safety.",

      "title": "Conversion disorder following termination of pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "A variety of psychologic disorders may present as physical complaints without organic basis. As characterized by Sydenham over 300 years ago, such disorders \"mimic all the physical disease to which man is heir.\" The case here presents the evolution of a conversion disorder (urinary retention) in response to a decision to terminate pregnancy. The predominant disturbance in a conversion disorder is an involuntary loss or alteration in somatic function that is temporally related with an environmental stressor. Conversion, as a defense mechanism, provides primary gain by keeping the conflict from the patient's awareness and secondary gains by generating environmental support and avoidance of undesired activities. Awareness of a patient's current life events, past responses to stress, and support systems is essential in order to recognize and manage this array of physical complaints of functional origin.The case report discussed here presents the evolution of a conversion disorder (urinary retention) in response to a decision to terminate a pregnancy. According to the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM 3), the following are the current criteria for a diagnosis of conversion (psychogenic pain): the predominant disturbance is a loss of or alteration in physical functioning suggesting a physical disorder; psychological factors are judged to be etiologically involved as evidenced by 1 of the following--a temporal relationship exists between an environmental stimulus that apparently related to a psychological conflict or need and the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom, the symptom enables the individual to get support from the environment that otherwise might not be forthcoming, and the symptom enables the individual to avoid some noxious activity; it has been determined that the symptom is not under voluntary control; and the symptom cannot be explained by a known physical disorder or pathophysiologic mechanism. A 25-year old single white woman (para 0, gravida 1) was hospitalized for termination of pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation. The patient told her physician that she did not know she was pregnant. The operative procedure was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged. 5 days later she presented to the emergency room with the complaint that she was unable to void. Following catheterization, which recovered 800 mL of urine, the patient returned home. Within 24 hours she again complained of an inability to void. Admission to the gynecological service resulted in a 16-day stay involving a continued inability to void requiring repeated catheterizations. Psychiatric consultation revealed marked immaturity, an inappropriately labile affect, and indifference to her symptoms. A history of occasional substance abuse was elicited. Upon transfer to the psychiatric inpatient service, the patient began to void spontaneously. The reported incidence of psychiatric sequelae after therapeutic or legal abortion is low, but the degree of preabortion emotional difficulty appears in direct proportion to the incidence of postabortion behavioral complications. The selection of a target organ for conversion is often based upon its ability to achieve symbolic representation. In the case presented the anatomic proximity of the bladder and uterus is cogent with the Freudian concent of somatic compliance whereby a previous somatic injury or disease may dictate the conversion focus by reactivation of the original event.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

Significant recovery of erectile function may be observed within the first 12 mo and occasionally several months there after.

      "title": "Whiplash headache: Does the diagnosis make more harm than the whiplash?",
      "abstract": "According to the study of Obermann et al. in the current issue of Cephalalgia, headache after whiplash injury is a self-limiting condition with a good prognosis. Although 4.6% fulfilled criteria for chronic whiplash headache, i.e. still having headache after 3 months, none had headache lasting more than 1 year. Predictors for headache lasting > 3 months were medication overuse, pre-existing pain conditions, and several psychological factors. Another factor, sore throat after the whiplash, was somewhat speculatively interpreted as a possible result of musculoskeletal damage. The headaches were mostly compatible with tension-type headache (TTH). Although the study has a positive message, that the headache subsides in less than a year, it also demonstrates some very problematic aspects of the whiplash headache entity. First, the criteria contain no description of the headache itself. It is sufficient that the headache and neck pain occur within 7 days after an event with a possible whiplash mechanism. For the chronic whiplash headache, it is required that the headache persists for > 3 months after the accident, but there is no requirement that the headache occurs with a certain frequency. This is in contrast to, for example, chronic TTH, where the headache must occur on more than half of the days for > 3 months. Quite wisely, therefore, the authors have in their definition of chronic headache added the requirement that the headache shall occur daily or near daily. Nevertheless, to find enough patients with ‘chronic’ headache for the analysis, they also used the criteria of the Quebec task force (QTF), but also these criteria have no definition of chronicity. An even more problematic aspect of the chronic whiplash headache entity is that, according to the very lax International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) criteria, in principle any headache that occurs in an individual for years after the event can be classified as chronic whiplash headache, provided that there was head and neck pain during the first week. This is so even though this single event leaves no trace in the body that can be demonstrated by objective means, and even if the headache resembles the naturally occurring primary headaches, as demonstrated in this and previous studies (1,2). This issue is even more crucial after the demonstration that even sham whiplash accidents, involving virtually no physical forces but many psychological stressors, could induce head and neck pain in up to 20% of the exposed individuals within the first days after the event (3), hence allowing a diagnosis of whiplash headache according to the current ICHD-II criteria. Thus, it may be that so-called whiplash headache mostly or even exclusively represents primary headache induced by the stress of the situation (2). Theoretically, it is highly unsatisfactory to have a headache category named after each type of precipitant for headache episodes, psychological or other. From a practical viewpoint, it is probably unsound to name the headache after the whiplash event if the headache is a primary headache, particularly since most patients and health professionals will then tend to understand the aetiology in terms of a physical injury to head and neck structures. Many unhealthy practices (e.g. use of a neck collar, hazardous neck operations) that may increase the complaints stem from a traumatic conception of the headache, and the prognosis of headache after rear-end collisions seems to be best in cultures where the traumatic event is ignored (4). In the present study the incidence of chronic headache is consistent with the prevalence figures of chronic headache seen in population-based studies, and the authors wisely comment that development of chronicity in this whiplash group may have similar pathophysiological or clinical mechanisms to chronic headache in general. In my opinion, this raises the issue of whether whiplash headache is a biologically meaningful entity, i.e. caused by injury to head or neck structures. To solve this problem, descriptive case series based on patients presenting in an emergency room or to a",

      "abstract": "A very considerable proportion of women, estimated from 50 to 80 per cent, experience a noticeable period of emotional distress, usually mild or transistor, between the third and the tenth day postpartum (postpartum blues: PPB). The onset of this syndrome conform to a practically immutable of timing-symptoms are almost never noted before the third day postpartum (latent period). After this period, in approximately 10 per cent of women, occurs a depression: postpartum depression (PPD), and last to 8 weeks. Neuro endocrine factors in the pathogenesis of postpartum depression is discussed: thyroid, pituitary and adrenal cortex are reviewed. Considerable evidence support that the late postpartum syndromes are associated to psychological stress of childbirth with postpartum decrease of placental steroids, estrogen and progesteron, with high levels of pituitary prolactin.",

If that discrete and sustained discharge occurs in the temporal lobe or limbic region of the brain, the condition is referred to as nonconvulsive complex partial status epilepticus (discussed in Chapter 10). If the discharge is ongoing in systems that subserve language function, an aphasia may result (see Chapter 11). This chapter will deal with the disorders and conditions associated with FSE arising from other regions of the brain. This condition can be associated with a wide variety of neurologic disorders and have a multitude of signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms vary according to the function of the brain area engaged by the discharge and can be as simple as a repetitive movement, as seen in epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), or as subtle as an inability to write to command (see case example).",

It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data. Differential diagnostics is critical for planning an effective rehabilitation programme.",

The patient's principal manifestations were extreme emotions or tears when she saw, heard, or spoke about sad news or other sad things; the durations of these unmanageable emotions were often less than 30 sec, and they occurred at frequencies that ranged from one to several times a day. Occasionally, she laughed uncontrollably while people were talking despite a lack of funny or sad stimuli in the conversation or the surrounding environment. Thus, her social functioning was impaired.

      "abstract": "Exposure to stressful situations is among the most common human experiences. These types of situations can range from unexpected calamities to routine daily annoyances. In response to stressors, a series of behavioral, neurochemical, and immunological changes occur that ought to serve in an adaptive capacity. However, if those systems become overly taxed, the organism may become vulnerable to pathology. Likewise, the biological changes, if sufficiently sustained, may themselves adversely affect the organism's well-being. Several factors may dictate an individual's response to environmental stressors, including characteristics of the stressor (i.e., type of stressor and its controllability, predictability, and chronicity); biological factors (i.e., age, gender, and genetics); and the subject's previous stressor history and early life experiences. Research on the physiological and psychological responses to different types of stressful stimuli is presented, focusing particularly on processes that may be relevant to the development of alcohol use disorders. Stressful events may profoundly influence the use of alcohol or other drugs (AODs). For example, the resumption of AOD use after a lengthy period of abstinence may reflect a person's attempt to self-medicate to attenuate the adverse psychological consequences of stressors (e.g., anxiety). Alternatively, stress may increase the reinforcing effects of AODs.",

EnglishCONTRIBUTION OF NURSING AND IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTHCARE QUALITY REGARDING THE ASSISTANCE OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CONFUSIONAL SYNDROME Abstract Introduction and objectives. The acute confusional syndrome (ACS) is a familiar process that may occur after hospitalisation and which can be defined as a transitory mental disorder, characterised by a global disturbance in cognition and attention as well as a low consciousness level, an alteration of psychomotor function and a disorder in the sleep-wake cycle. It appears in a sudden, acute way, specially at night, together with other organic processes and it has got a relatively short duration (less than a month) Objective: to analyse the population and its demographic and clinical features in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and show nursing contribution after a clinical trial on actions in ACS cases. Instruments and methodology Type of research: clinical trial, randonized, not blind , with parallel samples, prospective, analytical and longitudinal. Sample: patients hospitalized in the ICU that comply with the required characteristics. Case: patient who develops ACS in the ICU and who has all the inclusion requirements and has no exclusion ones. Place : The ICU of the Hospital General Universitario in the Region of Murcia. Timing : Two years of field research. Development: after the patient admission in the ICU, general data is collected, implementing familiar risks factors, sociodemographic data and clinical data among others. CAM-ICU and scale level of sedation (SAS) validated questionnaires are provided to the nursing staff, who will implement environmental control measures, reorientation and other interventions in the study group. Statistical processing : by means of IBM SPSS Statistics v.20. A descriptive statistic with calculated weighted mean has been applied, together with standard deviation for the quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages for the qualitative ones. The statistical inference has been calculated on a maximum error of 5% and a 95% of reliability (confidence), accepting statistical meaning if p Calculation of Chi of Pearson, with study of corrected non-valid data. For the expected lower frequences, the Fisher exact statistics has been applied. The Student T Test has been used for the comparison of independent samples for the equality of means. Ethical considerations : The study has been approved by the CEIC of the Health Department and the UMU Results: Population: 1093 patients; age: 65,4 years of age, DE16, male 64%; Level of severity APACHE II 15 out of 9; Average ICU stay: 5,77 days; Discarded samples: 15%; most frequent diagnosis: acute coronary syndrome without st elevation (SCASEST). 6,8% develop SCA and comply with requirements. Control group 34 (52%), intervention group 33 (48%). Their ICU stay has ranged between 7 and 11 days, having 5 predisposing factors and 6-7 precipitating factors. The SCA condition has lasted between 36 and 48 hours. The nursing staff provide a specific planning care to the study group, with an average of 14 interventions in every working shift, devoting 43,71 minutes. Conclusions: The epidemiologic profile of a patient with a SCA condition is male, 74,4 years old, independent, retired whose reason for hospitalisation is coronary heart disease and/ or sepsis/septic shock with a low-medium level of severity, with a medical history of ATH, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and stroke. Previous smoking habits have also proved to be an influential factor. The patients have been treated with Haloperidol for delirium control. The application of nursing methodology together with an individual care plan on these patients have been highly effective as it has reduced both the SCA process and patient recovery time.",

Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

      "title": "The Clinical Value of Intensive Monitoring in Term Asphyxiated Newborns",
      "abstract": "textabstractPerinatal asphyxia is an important cause of brain injury. It may\r\nlead to hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) which occurs in one to\r\nsix of every 1000 full term births. The risk of death or severe handicap is\r\n0.5-2.0 out of 1000. Following intrapartum asphyxia cerebral hypoperfusion\r\nin combination with hypoxia produces characteristic neuropathological\r\nchanges and related clinical signs. After the primary insult\r\nthere is a thirty minutes period of reperfusion characterized by the partial\r\nrecovery of cell and metabolic processes. This is followed by a latent\r\nphase which may last up to six hours. In this phase oxidative metabolism\r\n(near) normalizes (shown by MRspectroscopy) but EEG activity is depressed\r\nand the blood flow is likely to be reduced. Secondary energy failure\r\nand secondary hyperperfusion (‘luxury perfusion’) may occur in the\r\nneonatal brain within 6-15 hours after an acute ischaemic insult, marked\r\nby the acute onset of seizures (peaking at about 12 hours post insult).\r\nExcitotoxins accumulate in the cell and cell death may take 72 hours to\r\ncompletion. The infant’s gestational age and thus the maturational\r\nstage of the brain, as well as type, severity and duration of the insult are\r\ndeterminants of the brain injury. During the insult there is redistribution\r\nof blood flow to the brain, heart and adrenals. Our current understanding\r\nof perinatal asphyxia is based on animal experiments. Different and\r\nmixed etiologies lead to a range of post asphyxial patterns, usually subdivided\r\ninto different patterns; acute, chronic or a combination of these\r\ntwo. With chronic, possibly repetitive insults, lesions are predominantly\r\nseen in (sub)cortical structures. This has been named watershed injury\r\nfor its classical distribution along the borderzones between the major\r\npial arteries, sparing thalamus and basal ganglia. From the literature it\r\nappears that watershed injury is observed most frequently in context\r\nof term birth asphyxia. In acute and (near) total asphyxia the damage is\r\nmostly to the thalami, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum, brain\r\nstem and specific areas of the neocortex like the rolandic, calcarine and\r\ninsular cortex.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

This also has treatment implications in old age. Case presentation: A 65-year-old female who presented with mood and psychotic symptoms pose diagnostic dilemma. Careful history, collateral examination and continual exploration were done for accurate diagnosis and proper management. Due to overlapping symptoms, the initial diagnosis of psychotic depression was revised to paranoid schizophrenia. Eventually, the detailed examination, neurological and laboratory work up were done and the treatment approach was adjusted. The diagnostic dilemma appeared during the initial stage of the late onset psychosis due to affective symptoms. This case emphasises the critical role of clinical acumen in identifying the possibility of schizophrenia and other psychoses, ruling out organic aetiology and balancing the need of psychotropic drugs in old age.",

Severe postpartum psychotic depressive or manic illness is rare. Risk factors include younger age, primiparity, a family history of mental illness, and most importantly a personal history of psychotic illness. In patients with postpartum psychosis, pharmacologic therapy should be initiated as soon as possible and short-term hospitalization may be necessary. Electroconvulsant therapy (ECT) has been used in this setting with some success. Many of these women go on to develop life-long depressive disorders. Interestingly, suicide is uncommon during pregnancy and the year following delivery. Prophylactic pharmacotherapy should be considered in women at high risk of postpartum depression or psychosis. The natural history of a postpartum depressive episode is one of gradual improvement over the 6–12 months following delivery. Supportive care and monthly follow-up for the first 3-6 months may be all that is required.",

      "title": "A Psychopathological Consideration on the Neurotic Depersonalization",
      "abstract": "The author has tried a life-historical analysis on thirty cases of neurotic depersonalization in regard to the psychogenesis. At the same time, the ego structure in these patients has been discussed.1) The ability of estimation of love in these patients was seriously twisted as they had been loved too much or too little in their infancy. The character features such as peculiar sensitiveness in interpersonal relationship, monopolistic tendency, strong need for might, self-assertion, selfishness, etc. were all attribuable to the various factors in their infantile life-history. In common to the neurotics, the frustration tolerance (especially for love) was also extremely faible and the socialization of personality was pretty insufficient in these patients. This fact means the elevated susceptibility to affective frustrations in the future.2) The depersonalization appears always after the intense inner tension for certain period, which signifies the consumption of psychological force ( Janet). The abrupt abasement of psychological tension is motivated by the sudden affective deprivation or by the strong menaces to or the sudden interruption of the tendency of self-enlargement in such circumstances. The depersonalization is caused by the reduction of the secondary action ( Janet) which is brought about by the abasement of psychological tension. At the same time, the state completely narcissistic would develop in such conditions just mentioned. On the contrary, the displacement of these motives and the resolution of the inner tension will play an important role in the disparition of the depersonalization symptoms.3) Last of all, the depersonalization begins, according to Federn, whenever the outer ego-boundary becomes weak and consequently the egotized data concerned lose the energy cathexes. This weakening of the outer ego-boundary results, in my opinion, from the ego weakness which is attribuable to constitutional factors in one hand and to the intense inner tension for certain period on the other. In the psychogenesis of depersonalization, Federn emphasized the mechanism of projection of this primary ego disturbance to the outer objects. From the psychoanlytic point of view, the reduction of libido and mortido components in the ego cathexes to objects is the result of the relative increase of medial ego cathexes, which is the most primitive form of ego libido (Federn), caused by the lifehistorically developped narcissism. The organs and the functions to which libido is mostly invested in healthy state are influenced most seriously in the deprsonalized patients. Finally, it is relatively strengthened by the weakening of tile inner ego-boundary.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Psychotropic-related sexual dysfunction is a quite frequent issue in clinical practice, mainly in chronic treatments affecting both quality of life and compliance. Recent findings In the last decade fortunately antidepressants and antipsychotic compounds have been deeply screened in order to identify sexual adverse events that were commonly underdiagnosed and previously underestimated by clinicians and perhaps by pharmaceutical companies as well. Some differences in the mechanism of action are the nucleus of this poorly tolerated adverse event. All antidepressants with serotonergic activity can cause mild to severe sexual dysfunction such as decreased libido and delayed orgasm frequently (>60%) or anorgasmia and arousal difficulties sometimes (30%). In contrast, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, or melatonergic antidepressants do not cause sexual dysfunction but perhaps the clinical profile of patients receiving these compounds could be different. Antipsychotics that highly increase prolactin levels and strongly block dopamine receptors could be related to sexual dysfunction as well. Unfortunately, these dysfunctions are present during the long term after the antipsychotic onset to provide continued symptom control and enable recovery. Young patients suffering psychosis and concomitant sexual dysfunction (erectile and/or orgasmic difficulties) tend to show poor compliance in chronic treatments affecting the outcomes. Summary The implications of psychotropic-related sexual dysfunction in clinical practice are relevant mainly in patients under long-term treatment with previous satisfactory sexual life. Implications for future research about sexual dysfunction in all new treatments should be strongly taken into account.",

      "abstract": "Summary Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness due to damage of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not. Emergent EEG examination should be a routine part of evaluation in these children for the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE.",

The most common age for these symptoms to occur is 4-6 yr, after the child is toilet trained, and the vast majority are boys. This condition is termed the daytime frequency syndrome of childhood or Pollakiuria. The condition is functional no anatomic problem is detected. The symptoms occur often just before a child starts kindergarten or if the child is having emotional family stress-related problems. OCD is a chronically disabling illness characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors over which the patient has little or no control. OCD has a lifetime prevalence of 1-3% worldwide, and as many as 80% of all cases have their onset in childhood and adolescence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between OCD and Pollakiuria. \r\nMaterials and Methods:In this case-control study, we evaluated (152) children aged 6-18 years old who were visited in the pediatric clinics of Amir-Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. The control group considered of (76) healthy children and the case group included (76) age and sex matched children with Pollakiuria. Then, the children’s behavioral status was evaluated using the children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (C-YBOCS). The C-YBOCS is helpful in identifying children with OCD. The data was analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics in SPSS-16. \r\nResults: OCD was detected in (5) case (6.6%) with Pollakiuria and (8) controls (10.5%). The difference in OCD was not significant (p-value 0.282) between the two groups.\r\nConclusion: OCD isn’t more common in Pollakiuria versus non-Pollakiuria children. It is recommended to conduct a study with higher sample volume in order to detect the relationship between OCD and Pollakiuria.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Child, Obsessive-Compulsive disorder, Pollakiuria",

      "title": "Epilepsy, cognition, and behavior: The clinical picture",
      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "abstract": "Background Violent behaviour can be a presenting sign of first-episode psychosis. Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) has been a focus of attention because it is a potentially modifiable factor that may influence outcome. Aims The aim was to review the literature addressing the following issues: prevalence of violence or aggression in the first episode of psychosis, violence or aggression during the periods before and after the initiation of treatment, the DUP and relation between DUP and the level of violence or aggression in first-episode psychosis. Methods MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched for articles using the combination of key words 'aggression' (limited to humans) and 'first episode' and 'psychosis'. Results Available evidence suggests that the prevalence of violent behaviour in the first episode of psychosis, particularly schizophrenia, is greater than during the later stages of the illness. First-episode psychosis is associated with an increased risk of homicide. There is some limited support for an effect of DUP length on serious violence or aggression. Violent behaviour frequently develops before the onset of first episode. Substance use disorders are additional factors that elevate the risk for violence in these patients. Conclusions Earlier treatment of first episode psychosis might prevent some homicides. Personality factors and substance abuse may be more important than psychotic symptoms in the development of aggressive behaviour in patients with first-episode psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Patients with epilepsy have 6–12 times higher risk of suffering from psychosis, with a prevalence of about 7–8%, and the coexistence of these two conditions is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The psychosis of epilepsy is generally split into two groups: interictal psychoses and postictal psychosis (PIP), and the latter has been estimated to represent 25% of all types. However, many of these episodes remain under-recognized and/or are often misdiagnosed. Objectives To provide an overview of PIP. Methods Literature review based on PubMed/Medline, using the keywords “epilepsy” and “psychosis”. Results PIP has been recognized since the 19th century, when Esquirol described postictal “fury”. Although its etiology and pathogenesis remain poorly understood, several risk factors and etiopathogenic mechanisms have been suggested and analysed. An essential step in PIP management is its accurate and early diagnosis. Generally, before the onset of PIP there is a lucid period of one to six days after the seizure(s). PIP frequently has a polymorphic presentation, tends to be affect-laden and symptoms often fluctuate. It is of limited duration and frequently responds very rapidly to low doses of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. However, the propensity of the antipsychotics to provoke seizures and the risk of pharmacokinetic interaction with anti-epileptics are important considerations. Recurrence rates range 25% to 50%. Conclusions Given the negative impact of PIP in morbidity and mortality among these patients, it is crucial that neurologists and psychiatrists are able to adequately recognize and treat this clinical condition.

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

New- onset seizures are common in children and SE is the presenting symptom in approximately 10%.2\n\nThe precise definition of SE is undergoing evolution and greatly depends on the question being asked and the conceptual basis. The standard definition is “a seizure or a series of seizures without full recovery in between lasting ≥30 minutes.”3,4 The conceptual framework underlying this definition is that status must persist long enough to produce cerebral injury different from any underlying insult that led to the seizure. For this injury-based definition, 30 minutes remains appropriate, as studies that demonstrate seizure-induced injury, notably in prolonged febrile seizures, all find that it takes at least 30 minutes, and usually considerably longer, to produce detectable injury in children.5 The optimal duration for defining SE is somewhat less clear when the definition relates to the failure of inhibitory mechanisms that ordinarily terminate a seizure before it becomes prolonged.2 Our studies reveal …",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "title": "Intravenous fentanyl analgesia with midazolam induced sedation +/- local anesthesia for short painful procedures: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to assess whether intravenous fentanyl, of the available analgesia options, has the “best” pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile for short procedural analgesia, in the setting of intravenous midazolam induced sedation, with or without local analgesia. Background Many investigative and therapeutic medical procedures are painful, uncomfortable and/or otherwise distressing to the patient. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.”1(p.5) The IASP describes acute pain as being “of recent onset and limited duration”. Acute pain usually has an identifiable temporal and causal relationship to injury or disease. The IASP upholds that “pain is not a directly observable or measurable phenomenon, but rather a subjective experience that bears a variable relationship with tissue damage.”2(p.1) A 'short’ painful procedure may be described as an intervention anticipated to take less than 60 minutes, although many procedures generating acute pain can take as little as five to 10 minutes. These short interventions usually involve manipulation of the body in a way that generates pain, such as placement of a needle once or multiple times, placement of a percutaneous catheter or drainage tube, insufflation of the colon with air to facilitate colonoscopy, or bone trephine during bone marrow biopsy. A number of options are available to help ameliorate the pain, discomfort and distress generated by such experiences, including local anesthesia, general anesthesia or procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA). Equipment and staffing resources required for general anesthesia, local anesthesia and PSA vary substantially and there is potential benefit, both in terms of timely access and economics, to using the most appropriate and ‘least complex’ anesthesia approach to facilitate a medical procedure.3-5 Many short procedures can be undertaken with PSA. Whilst superficial diagnostic or surgical interventions may be performed with local anesthesia alone, complete regional anesthesia is often not possible and/or undesirable for many procedures. Some procedures, such as muscle biopsy by needle, specifically require that local anesthesia not be used beyond the skin. Many procedures may be performed with spinal anesthesia or individual limb anesthesia (nerve or Bier's block), but the placement of regional anesthesia is not without risk and often requires a recovery time longer than that for PSA. PSA is induced through the administration of drugs which produce analgesia, anxiolysis, amnesia, sleepiness and relaxation.6 A number of different terms have been used to describe this approach, including ‘conscious sedation’, but the depth of sedation and analgesia may vary and the more generic terms ‘procedural sedation’ or ‘procedural sedation and analgesia’ have been adopted to describe the wide range of specific sedation and analgesia techniques which may be employed.7,8 A number of guidelines have been published to guide the use of midazolam and fentanyl for PSA.9,10 These guidelines are often written to guide the practice of personnel with no formal training in sedation pharmacology or sedation clinical practice. Some procedures, such as bone marrow biopsy, are very short, with the discomfort or pain lasting only 2-5 minutes. In 2011, Watmough and Flynn completed a structured evidence review of analgesic approaches for bone marrow biopsy in adults.11 Conducting an extensive literature search, they identified 12 research reports for consideration. Their review found, rather surprisingly, that in spite of the popularity of PSA, no study had examined the analgesic effectiveness of fentanyl for bone marrow biopsy. All of the identified papers described bone marrow biopsy as causing pain, with one research study finding that without sedation or analgesia, 85% of subjects experienced “intense pain”.12 Watmough and Flynn's report revealed that most of the identified “pain intervention” strategies were actually a reliance on benzodiazepine-induced sedation and amnesia, as opposed to true analgesia. A contentious argument is that where a medical procedure is to be a ‘one off’ event or a 'short’ procedure, that it is acceptable that the patient may experience some minor discomfort, or even pain. Or, even if the analgesia is inadequate, any pain that the patient may experience is unlikely to be remembered because of the amnestic effect of midazolam or other drug used for sedation. However, many clients receiving health services, such as hematology or renal medicine, endure repeated painful procedures, such as bone marrow biopsy or balloon arterio-venous fistuloplasty. The discomfort associated with these short, painful procedures is usually brief, but can be very intense and distressing. The amnesia which is associated with benzodiazepine sedation is not guaranteed,13 and patients may be left with the memory of a traumatic experience. Patients may ultimately refuse, or be extremely reluctant to present for a repeat procedure because of the anxiety and distress precipitated by memories of the first painful experience. Getting PSA correctly targeted for each individual patient is an important clinical step, which improves the quality of the patient's overall experience with the health service and ultimately builds trust between the patient and the clinician, facilitating improved compliance with disease management. Kost14(p.99) has identified the ideal characteristics (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) of injected drugs for PSA to include: Rapid onset of action Short duration of action Lack of cumulative effects Rapid recovery Minimal side effects Rapid metabolism to inactive non-toxic metabolites Residual analgesia No single drug satisfies all of the requirements for PSA or meets all of the identified ideal characteristics. A combination of drugs is usually required, but many drugs will provide multiple effects; for example droperidol is both anti-emetic and sedative. The sedationist is faced with a choice of multiple agents for both the sedation and analgesia components of PSA and must consider the combined and possibly synergistic effects of the drugs chosen.15,16 Over the past half century, a number of drugs have come into and gone out of favor for PSA, but outside of anesthesia and emergency room environments, the most commonly used drugs to facilitate PSA in adults are now perhaps the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam and the opioid fentanyl, both given intravenously.17 These drugs have been in common use for the past 25 years. The drug propofol is a general anesthetic induction and maintenance agent, which is also an excellent hypnotic sedative. It is in common use for procedural sedation and although its analgesic properties appear to be limited,18 using propofol for procedural sedation can reduce or even eliminate the requirement for an opioid analgesic. In the hands of a competent and trained sedationist, propofol is a safe and effective drug. However, it has a narrow margin of safety and can rapidly induce deep unconsciousness and loss of airway. Its use by non-anesthetists is controversial and not accepted in all settings.19 The use of midazolam-based PSA therefore remains necessary and widely practiced. In a controlled setting, the administration of midazolam and fentanyl for PSA is generally considered safe and effective for many procedures and may be performed by a non-anesthetist sedationist.20 Although midazolam may exhibit some analgesic qualities when used in combination with local anesthesia for regional block, systemic analgesia is likely very limited.21 The evidence is somewhat contradictory, but sedative-hypnotic drugs may actually increase pain perception. It is generally accepted that when sedation is induced for a painful medical procedure, supplementary analgesia should be used.22 Apart from fentanyl, other analgesic drugs have been used for procedural analgesia, including (but not limited to) oxycodone, morphine, meperidine (pethidine), alfentanil, sufentanil and remifentanil. Some of these agents may be delivered through methods other than the intravenous route. Each analgesic option presents the sedationist with perceived advantages and disadvantages, including onset and analgesia effect times, depth of analgesia, safety and side-effects.23 Anesthesia and sedation practice are often described as both a science and an art. The training, knowledge and experience of the sedationist inform the decision making involved in developing a PSA plan for each individual patient and procedure, including choice of sedation and analgesic agents. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid first isolated by Dr. Paul Janssen in 1960.24 It has a relatively short onset and elimination time, is associated with few unpleasant side-effects and has a relatively good margin of safety.20,25 Because of this pharmacological profile, intravenous fentanyl is commonly used for procedural analgesia.26 However, the necessity, utility and safety of fentanyl, when used for short PSA, are not clear. Among anesthesia/sedation providers, PSA practices for short painful procedures do vary widely and each anesthetist/sedationist is able to give reasoned justifications for his or her own approach. A systematic review of the existing research related to the effectiveness and safety of fentanyl can be used to inform clinician decision making about selection of analgesia for short, painful procedures and assist in the future development of guidelines for the use of fentanyl or other analgesic approaches during PSA.",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Der nicht-konvulsive Status epilepticus (NKSE) ist gekennzeichnet durch andauernde elektroklinische epileptische Aktivität oder durch eine Abfolge von epileptischen Anfällen, zwischen denen der Patient nicht zum Vorzustand zurückkehrt, und die ohne eindeutige tonische-klonische Entäußerungen einhergehen. Diese „stille“ Manifestation andauernder klinisch-neurologischer Symptome wie Aphasie, Verwirrung, etc. erschwert das Erkennen eines NKSE; oft ist der wichtigste Diagnoseschritt, überhaupt daran zu denken, dass die vorliegende Klinik auf einem NKSE beruhen könnte. Sicher nachgewiesen und bestätigt werden kann der NKSE nur durch eine unmittelbare EEG-Ableitung. In epidemiologischen Studien scheint der konvulsive Status epilepticus (KSE) häufiger (60 : 40 %) vorzukommen, doch dies ist fraglich, werden doch viele NKSE aufgrund der unspektakulären Manifestation verpasst. Pathophysiologisch spielen sich auf neuronaler Ebene dieselben Phänomene wie beim KSE ab, einfach nur nicht in den primären Motoneuronen. Die permanente Hyperexzitabilität kann die vom NKSE betroffenen Neuronen genauso schädigen. Hingegen fehlen die unmittelbar vital bedrohlichen sekundären pathophysiologischen Folgen des KSE (Lactat-Azidose, respiratorische Erschöpfung, Rhabdomyolyse, etc.) beim NKSE weitgehend. Doch auch dort können autonome Phänomene (Arrhythmien [Kammertachykardie oder Asystolie] und Atmungsprobleme) den Patienten akut lebensgefährlich gefährden. Die Ursachen für einen NKSE sind vielfältig und umfassen bei Patienten mit einer bekannten Epilepsie v. a. Medikationsprobleme (mangelnde Adhärenz, Interaktionen bei Zugabe anderer Medikamente); bei ihnen sowie denjenigen Betroffenen ohne bekannte Epilepsie kommen metabolische, toxische, strukturelle (Tumore, Blutungen, Ischämien), infektiöse, entzündliche und autoimmune Ursachen in Frage. Entsprechend breit sollte die Ursache für einen NKSE abgeklärt werden, da besonders bei den akuten symptomatischen Formen die Behandlung der Ursache mindestens so wichtig ist wie die anfallsbeendende Behandlung des NKSE.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados.

      "title": "Die Depression in der Postpartalzeit: eine diagnostische und therapeutische Herausforderung",
      "abstract": "Postpartum is not a specific entity. There is neither a very specific psychopathology nor evidence for a specific aetiology. The prevalence of severe is not significantly enhanced in the year as compared to women of the same age group without delivery who have quite a high prevalence of anyway. Incidence of milder might slightly be enhanced in the first weeks. Giving birth and adapting to the new mother role seem to be stressors contributing to the outbreak of in vulnerable, predisposed women or to enhance pre-existing depression. Biological, especially hormonal, as well as psychosocial factors can be relevant stressors in this situation. Although this is not a specific entity, the diagnostic term or specifier postpartum depression might still be justified, as in early motherhood shows many important specifities. Diagnosis is especially difficult, as women, due to shame, stigma and many fears, do not seek help and doctors, due to misinterpretation of symptoms, often do not recognise the severity of the situation. Untreated, these disorders can have especially severe consequences, not only for the mother, but also for the child and the whole family. These disorders therefore need our special attention and special treatment. This means modifications of our pharmacological, non-pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment methods. Therapy - although in principle the same as that of other depressive disorders - has to put a special emphasis on the needs of the period. Education about the fact that this is a disease and not due to failure as a mother is of utmost importance to relieve the patients from feelings of guilt. Counselling and practical advice for the mother and her family is often needed as well as the help of a midwife, a family nurse, a social worker and/or other health care professionals. A good mother-infant bonding should be a main concern from the start. This means that the mother should not be separated from her infant for longer periods of time. However, she needs a lot of help in order to allow for relaxed contacts with the infant. Pharmacological treatment is often complicated by the patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation as regards the potential side effects and/or long-term consequences for the infant. On the other hand, the risks of ongoing severe are generally regarded as higher than the potential risks of medication. Thus, if a mother insists on breast-feeding, she has to be educated about side effects and the baby has to be carefully monitored. Several studies have in the meantime also shown positive effects of oestrogen substitution and non-pharmacological treatments such as bright-light therapy. Psychotherapy should be initiated as soon as possible and be very supportive in the beginning. Specific manualised forms of psychotherapy for women with have also shown very promising results. In the future, more emphasis should be laid on prophylaxis, specific education and the broad implementation of low-threshold services. Under all circumstances, special attention must be given to the mother-child-relationship, on the one hand to reduce feelings of guilt in the mother and thereby to enhance the process of healing, on the other hand to prevent traumatisation of the infant and to avoid deleterious long-term consequences.",

Women living with psychiatric illness, despite their frequent sexual difficulties, consider sexuality to be an important aspect of their quality of life. Antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, the neurobiology and symptoms of the illness, past trauma, difficulties in establishing relationships and stigmatization can all contribute to sexual dysfunction. Low sexual desire is strongly linked to depression. Lack of subjective arousal and pleasure are linked to trait anxiety: the sensations of physical sexual arousal may lead to fear rather than to pleasure. The most common type of sexual pain is 10 times more common in women with previous diagnoses of anxiety disorder. Clinicians often do not routinely inquire about their patients' sexual concerns, particularly in the context of psychotic illness but careful assessment, diagnosis and explanation of their situation is necessary and in keeping with patients' wishes. Evidence-based pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available but poorly researched in the context of psychotic illness.",

That Happiness and Sadness, the two normal and very common emotions of every human being, constitute the core clinical features of a disease, Depressive Illness (MDI), remains a fascinating, though disturbing, fact. The magnification of joy and worry, two poles of the normal emotional spectrum, reaches such gigantic proportion necessitating treatment. The clinical presentation varying between the two poles, often alternating, naturally reveals itself as a spectrum disorder of conditions and related temperaments. For Eugene Bleuler a patient was predominantly schizophrenic or predominantly manic-depressive in the spectrum of psychosis. But Emil Kraeplin, father of classification in modern psychiatry, segregated the two major psychotic illnesses into Manic-depressive insanity and Dementia praecox. By 1913, Kraeplin brought virtually all of the major clinical forms, which had *Episodic or Periodic course *Benign prognosis *Family history of MDI, under the diagnosis of -Depressive illness (MDI) in which he included Bipolar Disorders (BD) and Recurrent Depressive Disorders. The Bipolar Spectrum concept can be approached from two different ways: *Manic - Depressive Spectrum: Continuum between Bipolar and Unipolar *Bipolar Spectrum: Restricted to BD with continuum between Full blown illness (BD I) to Milder illness to Temperament traits (Cyclothymia ……). Understanding the concept of Bipolar/Manic Depressive Spectrum demands a brief journey into the history dating back to the last quarter of 19th century. SHRINK IT - 1875-1925 [Figure 1]{Figure 1} The Northwest Wales asylum, opened in 1848, catered to a specific geographic location of the population and had admission of 3172 patients from 1875 to 1924. As depicted in the graph, mania as percentage of all admissions was 60% in 1885 which got Shrunk to around 20% in 1920. In 1885, the diagnosis of mania referred to any state of OVERACTIVE INSANITY. Around 1900, primarily in response to Kraeplin's impact, the use of mania as a diagnosis in North Wales began to fall (limited only to episodic illness with benign course) progressively to about 4% in 1924.[1] BROADEN IT: 2nd quarter of 20th century Manic Depressive insanity….. includes on one hand the whole domain of periodic and circular insanity, on the other hand simple mania, the greater parts of the morbid states termed Melancholia (Emil Kreaplin, 1924). [INLINE:1] The unifying Broadeningconcept of MDI, which brought together all the mood disorders, separating from Dementia Praecox, was based on *Episodic, recurrent course of illness *Benign course and outcome. SHRINK IT (again): 2nd half of 20th Century Move forward to the 3rd quarter and the first half of the 4th quarter of 20th century. The Kreaplinian concept of MDI was considered too inclusive and in 1957 Karl Leonhard proposed the concept, propagated later by the works of Angst, 2002,[2] and Perris, of dividing the MDI into two sub groups: Bipolar and Unipolar, the only difference being presence/absence of mania. The Broad MDI concept was shrunk again by separating BD group away from the unipolar group. The term bipolar was introduced in DSM III in 1980 and in ICD 10 in 1992; since then the unipolar and BD are categorized as two separate diagnostic entities in the classificatory system. …",

Introduction:Febrile seizures are the most common form of seizures in childhood; they are thought to occur in 2-5% of all children. 1-3Febrile seizures are defined as a seizure in association with a febrile illness in children without a central nervous system infection, previous afebrile seizure, known brain disorder, or electrolyte abnormalities. 1,2They typically occur between 6 months and 18 months of age though they can occur up to 5 years of age. 3 Febrile seizures are categorized as: simple (generalized seizure lasting less than 15 minutes in a child aged 6 months to 5 years, and less than 1 in a 24 hour period) or complex (a focal seizure or generalized seizure lasting greater than 15 minutes, or multiple seizures in a 24 hour period). 1,3 Treatment for febrile seizures is based on treating the underlying cause of the fever and giving reassurance and education to the parents. 2 Mortality is extremely rare, and there is no difference in the patient's cognitive abilities after a febrile seizure, even when the seizure is prolonged. 1Objectives: At the end of this simulation session, the learner will be able to: 1) discuss the management of febrile seizures 2) discuss when placement of an advanced airway is indicated in the management of a febrile seizure 3) list the risk factors for febrile seizures 4) prepare a differential diagnosis for the causes of febrile seizures 5) educate family members on febrile seizures.Methods: This educational session is a high-fidelity simulation.",

      "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour sleep patterns of 50 male alcohol addicts were assessed behaviorally during a 5-day base-line period, a 7- to 62-day period of spontaneous drinking and a subsequent alcohol withdrawal phase. Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

      "title": "The influence of chronic stress on health and coping mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Stress represents a negative life experience, closely followed by physiological, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes that focus on changing the event or adapting to its effects. Any situation or occurrence that requires adaptation can be experienced as a stress, even positive situations and circumstances may be stressful, whether they come from the outside world, or the sources of stress is internal. While acute stress does not necessarily have a negative effect, if it lasts for a long time, or is frequently repeated, it becomes chronic, and can cause various serious disorders. During chronic stress, there is an exhaustion of the body's capacity for an adequate reaction, which can lead to long-lasting immunological dysfunction, which significantly impairs health and quality of life. According to the WHO (2017), stress is one of the causes of even 60% known diseases, and in a number of mental disorders a direct connection with stress has been reported: in acute stress reactions, \"posttraumatic stress disorder\", adjustment disorders and other reactions to severe stress. In addition, in all categories of mental disorders (ICD-10), the stressful situation or event plays a significant role in occurrence of the symptoms. A particular category of stress-related disorders are psychosomatic disorders. These are functional disorders in which there is no pathoanatomic substrate. In contrast to these, psychosomatic diseases are the type of illness in which there are structural changes of tissues and organs, the etiology of which is based on chronic stress, in addition to a number of other factors (Adamović, 1983) and which occur when there is a biological predisposition. The paper presents the mechanism of development of these diseases and some of the ways of coping with stress. According to the DSM-V, psychosomatic diseases are divided into skin diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory diseases, heart and blood vessel diseases, disorders of endocrine glands, rheumatoid diseases, gynecological diseases and others. In order to overcome stress and preserve health, psychological strategies for coping with stress play an important role. Multiple strategies are used, which include various stress control techniques: relaxation techniques, meditation methods, and assertive training, biofeedback and stress inoculation techniques. Successful mastering of coping stressful situations, constructive problem solving in life crisis, relaxation techniques and contributions to better adaptation to unexpected changes in life are of key importance for both mental and physical health.",

Uncertainty in illness is a condition that accompanies the patient from the moment of appearance of the first somatic symptoms of the disease and could be strengthened or weakened thanks to many psychosocial factors. The level of uncertainty is related to the level of stress, emotional disadaptation, affective states, coping strategies, mechanisms of psychological defense, etc. Uncertainty can perform destructive functions, acting as a trigger for stressful conditions and launching negative emotional experiences. As a positive function of uncertainty, one can note a possible positive interpretation of the patient's disease. In addition, the state of uncertainty allows the patient to activate the resources of coping with the disease, among which the leading role belongs to social support.",

The present article will argue concerning the post-partum psychic disturbances, with emphasis in the Postpartum Depression. The Postpartum Depression is a mental disturbance of high prevalence and that it provokes emotional alterations, cognitive, mannering and physical. Its etiology is determined by a combination of factors that must be boarded in the diagnosis and the therapeutically one. The Postpartum depression appears in the majority of the times, in the two first weeks after the childbirth. The Postpartum Depression is an important psychiatric syndrome that in general it reverberates in the interaction mother-son and of negative form and practically promotes a gradual consuming in the relation with the familiar ones.

      "abstract": "Deep dyspareunia refers to pain with deep penetration or insertion into the vagina, which affects quality of life. The aim of this narrative review was to examine how the underlying conditions that give rise to deep dyspareunia, and the symptoms of these conditions, can affect sexual function and quality of life beyond the deep dyspareunia itself. For example, deep dyspareunia may be associated with gynecological pathologies that cause cyclical pain symptoms (e.g. dysmenorrhea, dyschezia/dysuria), resulting in quality of life changes related to menstrual cycle events such as ovulation or menstruation. Recurrent dysmenorrhea can cause hyperalgesic priming that sensitizes the nervous system, leading to chronic pelvic pain that can be exacerbated with sexual activity. The coexistence of functional bowel or bladder disorders can result in urgency and frequency that affect the sexual response cycle. Myofascial/musculoskeletal origins of deep dyspareunia may affect body positioning during sexual activity. Central nervous system sensitization can underlie these different factors, and also be associated with mental health conditions, which together can cause symptomatology across body systems that can affect all aspects of one's sexual life. Recognition and management of the far-reaching impacts of deep dyspareunia and its associated comorbidities may be important in clinical care to meaningfully improve quality of life. Future research should include a comprehensive empirical validation of the hypotheses and potential mechanisms in this review.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurrent, intrusive, and disturbing thoughts, as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviour. Insight into the senseless nature of the symptoms is generally preserved. Patients try, albeit usually unsuccessfully, to suppress the obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. Acting out the stereotypic behaviours reduces the anxiety generated by the obsessions and compulsions (APA, 2000). In 60% of patients OCD develops before the age of 25 yr, and onset of disease can already occur in childhood (Flament et al., 1990). Familial loading is higher in early-onset OCD, indicating that genetic factors may be of greater importance in OCD with early onset (Pauls et al., 1995).",

The majority of the patients (n-52) presented with generalized seizures with a complex development of generalized and partial motor disturbances throughout the entire paroxysm. The disturbances were divided into 3 variants. Referred to the first variant are convulsive manifestations in the structure of grand mal epilepsy when, in the presence of bilateral convulsions, they were predominant in the facial muscles on one side or muscles of the anterior or posterior aspect of the body. If generalized seizures were more predominant on one side, such motor disorders were attributed to the 2nd variant. The 3rd variant of generalized epileptic seizures was characterized by asymmetric convulsions.",

Policisti v Evropi in njihove policijske organizacije so se vedno podvrženi razlicnim predsodkom, izvirajocim iz policijske subkulture, ki je vecinoma povsod po svetu zelo podobna. Policisti in njihovi vodje imajo policista za posameznika, ki je nadpovprecno hraber in posten, ki sam resuje svoje težave in ne potrebuje drugih oseb, da bi jim morebiti zaupal svoje težave. Izražanje stiske, prevec emocionalno odzivanje in izkazovanje custev niso zaželeni, psihicne motnje ali celo bolezen pa so sramota. Prav tako je sramotno iskanje strokovne pomoci v primeru stiske in psihicnih težav, ki je velikokrat celo na nek nacin sankcionirano z omalovaževanjem takega posameznika kot slabica ali »motene« osebe, nesposobne opravljati odgovorne policijske naloge ter nosenja in rokovanja s službenim orožjem. \r\nNamen raziskave samomorov v slovenski policiji je bil prouciti skupne komponente in ugotovitve vec locenih raziskav in izvesti skupen sklep, na podlagi katerega bi laže in potrjeno dognali vzroke in skupne znacilnosti samomorov v slovenski policiji in policiji kot stanovski organizaciji nasploh.\r\nRaziskovalno nalogo smo razdelili na teoreticni in empiricni del ter povzeli skupne ugotovitve posameznih analiz, ki smo jih primerjali med seboj.

Predstavimo tudi dosedanje že izvedene analize na temo samomorov v policiji primerljivih držav in slovenski policiji, saj so bili podatki doslej že proucevani v diplomskih nalogah diplomantov Fakultete za varnostne vede Univerze v Mariboru in Medicinske fakultete Univerze v Ljubljani. Se posebej podrobno predstavimo podrocje pojava samomorilnosti v avstrijski policiji ter izvedemo primerjavo s podatki o samomorilnosti v slovenski policiji. Obenem primerjamo nacin izvedbe psiholoskega presejevanja kandidatov za policiste obeh policij in izpeljemo zakljucke, ki kažejo, da je ogroženost zaradi samomorilnosti v slovenski policiji manjsa od tiste v avstrijski policiji in policiji drugih primerljivih držav, da pa bi veljalo izboljsati sistem presejevanja kandidatov za policiste po vzoru avstrijskega modela. Podrobno predstavimo tudi izvedene teoreticne osnove znanstvenih analiz, opravljenih na Psihiatricni kliniki Ljubljana v casu po drugi svetovni vojni in po osamosvojitvi, in ugotovimo, da je trend samomorilnosti med slovensko splosno populacijo in med slovenskimi policisti podoben ter da se glede vzrokov, znanih indikatorjev in ugotovitve glede »kriticne« in najbolj ogrožene skupine posameznikov podatki iz ugotovitve izvedenih studij deloma prekrivajo. \r\nV empiricnem delu izvedemo primerjavo podatkov, pridobljenih v že izvedenih podobnih analizah samomorilnosti med splosno populacijo v Republiki Sloveniji, in rezultatov analiz raziskav, ki smo jih izvedli med policijsko populacijo v Republiki Sloveniji.

      "abstract": "Background: Obsessive idea is related to act, the patient trying a resistance, so that, if in delirium the patient agrees and aspires to, in obsession, the disagreement is the main characteristic. Research Questions: In aggressive obsession, there is the fear of self of not being aggressive with others, while in paranoid delirium there is the fear of being persecuted by others. Aim: The concept of schizo-obsessive disorder, with onset in adolescence with OC phenomenology, with subsequently negative symptoms, productive perceptual and ideational area (auditory hallucinations and pseudo-hallucinations, next to Kandinsky Clerambault syndrome). OC phenomenology acquires connotations different from schizophrenia onset, the patient never acquiring again a disorder total insight. Results: When obsessions and compulsions were related to the content of delusional ideas and hallucinations, other typical rituals of obsessive-compulsive disorders appeared too, the patient considered sometimes irrational and excessive. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms were present a significant period of the prodrome, of active phases and residual period, being time-consuming, causing distress and interfering patient’s routine, in addition to the schizophrenia deterioration. Conclusions: Social degradation is dictated mainly by the negative dimension of schizophrenia, secondly by energy consumption in fulfilling the rituals and compulsions and finally by the mood change in depressive sense. The family emotional climate in excess potentiates the negative inversion towards family, which amplifies the sensitiveness to rejection, sensitive relationship delirium, referentiality and finally social isolation.",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "title": "An Agent Model of Temporal Dynamics in Relapse and Recurrence in Depression",
      "abstract": "Unipolar depression is a mental disorder characterized by a persistent low mood and loss of awareness or contentment in usual activities [1]. Despite the modern era of pharmaceutical and holistic intervention, one of the primary problems with unipolar depression (i.e. a depression not related to other mental disorders) is that it has a very high rate of recurrent and relapse cases. At least 60 percent of individuals who have had one depressive episode will have another, 70 percent of individuals who have had two depressive episodes will have a third, and 90 percent of individuals with three episodes will have a fourth episode. Although the risk of relapse may decline with time, even for those who remain well for 5 years after an index episode, the rate of recurrence/relapse is 58 percent. Despite the magnitude of the problem of recurrence and relapse, little attention has been focused on the symptom pattern in recurrent episodes of major depression [4]. In practice, there is a need to have a mechanism to monitor the condition of individuals who have had a previous encounter with unipolar depression, eventually improving their quality of life. In order to achieve this objective, the aim of the embedding research project is to develop an agent-based application that is able to support humans in the long term. The software agent is expected to have capabilities to understand its environment and the individual, providing a better monitoring and assessment of the situation. To implement this capability in any software agent, it is required to incorporate a human agent model that shows how humans might fall into relapse/recurrence or stay healthy. In case a relapse or recurrence is predicted, the agent can provide to support by providing adequate remedies. In this model, there are four major components that will represent dynamic interactions of human agent abilities involved in recurrence/relapse namely; environment, personality, social support, and coping strategies [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. By combining these characteristics together, it will allow a hypothesis or expected behavior for the human agent to be monitored.",

Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

The results suggested that the more psychiatrically disturbed patients (ie, those with chronic psychotic and neurotic conditions) experienced less apparent relief than those patients who were considered to be more stable. This is perhaps understandable, since those patients with the more underlying stress probably experienced relatively less relief from the relatively new stress (the stressful pregnancy) than those in whom the stressful pregnancy presented itself as perhaps the most remarkable stress over a relatively more stable background. In other words, this stressful pregnancy was perhaps perceived as a pure and more clearly identifiable stress which, when removed, resulted in more dramatic symptom relief. I feel a more accurate description of the \"unwanted pregnancy\" would be \"stressful pregnancy.\" It is the perceived stress implicit in the pregnancy, and what is assumed will follow, that is unwanted.

Prevalence estimates of dyspareunia ranged from 0.4 to 61% in one recent systematic review [1], and there is considerable evidence to suggest that these varying rates reflect the inconsistency of dyspareunia definitions as well as differences in study design and measurement [1–3]. Women with dyspareunia, in general, suffer negative impacts in psychosocial and sexual areas of their lives [4].

Female sex, the number of previous traumata, a past history of simple phobia, threatened death, trauma exposure, hospitalization for trauma-induced injuries increases the odds of post-traumatic stress disorder, whereas a sense of control during the trauma, and alcohol consumption and intoxication decreases the odds of post-traumatic stress disorder. Major depression and anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia, commonly occur in response to accidental man-made traumatic events. The extent of physical injury, sex, age, loss of control, type of trauma, and the degree of exposure to the traumatic event partly determine the occurrence of these co-morbid disorders. This suggests that trauma variables, which are related to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, are also related to the occurrence of these co-morbid disorders.",

Up to 70% of new mothers develop mild depressive symptoms called “baby-blues” which include weepiness, sadness and mood lability. Those symptoms usually peak between 2 and 5 days post-delivery and abate spontaneously within days up to 2 weeks [2]. In contrast to “baby blues” postpartum depression can have a serious impact on functioning and even lead to suicidality rendering it highly important to detect the disorder as early as possible. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [3] is widely used to screen for postpartum depression and should be applied to all new mothers who develop depressive symptoms such as loss of interest, hopelessness and depressive feelings. Several risk factors for postpartum depression have been identified: Prenatal depression poses the highest risk, followed by low self-esteem, childcare stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress and lack of social support [4]. Postpartum depression is a treatable condition, however, it has to be distinguished from bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis, which require different treatment strategies [2].",

Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by desynchronization of the sleep/wake rhythm with the light/darkness cycle, generating an unbalanced sleep cycle.

In the case of puerperal psychosis, estrogen cascade follows a lengthy period of sustained high brain estrogen environment; in menstrual psychosis, it is postulated that the occurrence in at least some cases of anovulatory menstrual cycles, wherein high levels of relatively unopposed estrogens are maintained until the next ovulatory cycle, play a role in priming the central nervous system prior to premenstrual estrogen cascade. Further research in this area using more sensitive techniques to follow hormonal fluctuation and mental state is called for",

However an infection or a craniocerebral injury may interfere with the compensation of the premorbid defect of the nervous system: this was noted in 65% of children observed by the authors. Therefore, while specifying the syndromological structure of a disease one must take into account the time course of the premorbid defect. The compensation of that defect is hampered most often in children of the first year of the life. In these cases a loss of a part of acquired habits and appearance of earlier-age reflexes is noted. At the age of 2 to 5 years an aggravation of the atactic and hyperkinetic syndromes is observed, while at the age of over 5 years the negative time course of the premorbid defects is noted twice as rarer. Variants of the time course of the premorbid nervous disorders are specified. At the basis of reversible variants are disturbances on the part of hemodynamics and cerebrospinal fluid. This is confirmed by echo-EEG and REG findings. Persisting aggravation of the premorbid defect and appearance of new neurological symptoms are observed on development of hypoxic and metabolic disturbances. The nervous structures affected by perinatal hypoxia remain thenceforth to be especially sensitive to the effects of the latter. An analysis of the pathogenetic mechanisms of the premorbid defect decompensation may facilitate the realization of therapeutic and prophylactic measures.",

      "title": "Physiological and Pharmacological Induction of Affect",
      "abstract": "Abstract Systematically provoking affects and studying the resulting phenomena is an important strategy in affective science. Such induction studies not only yield insights into mechanisms of feeling states experienced in health but also provide models for psychopathological states, which in some cases may differ clinically from healthy affects, primarily in duration, intensity, or reactivity. In this chapter we review physiological and pharmacological methods of inducing affects, with a focus on studies that combine these techniques with functional brain imaging to explore the cerebral processes that underlie affects. Affective processes are extremely complex and diverse. They vary in duration, frequency, quality, and intensity. One method of subtyping affects is by temporal domains, with emotions the briefest, moods intermediate, and temperaments the most sustained. These entities vary in several ways in addition to duration (Table 50.1). Thus emotions are brief (lasting seconds to minutes) experiences that are often intense, reactive to acute precipitants, and accompanied by autonomic arousal (increased heart rate and blood pressure), and they lead to actions. In contrast, moods are of longer duration (lasting hours to days) and somewhat less intense; they range from reactive to spontaneous, they may be accompanied by more subtle (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation) arousal, and they tend to result in cognitions. Temperaments are the most sustained (lasting years to decades) and generally the least intense; they are largely constitutional but can occasionally be modified by persistent experiential factors, they generally lack autonomic features, and they yield integrative styles of interacting with the environment. These temporal domains of affective experiences are related to one another; different temperaments yield predispositions to different moods, which in turn yieldtendencies to varying emotions. Influences also exist in the opposite direction, with intense emotional experiences inrapidsuccession yielding particular moods and repeated or chronic moods on occasion resulting in temperamental shifts. These domains may have different neurobiological substrates. Recent functional brain imaging evidence suggests that emotions may be mediated by phylogenetically older anterior paralimbic structures. Such structures have access to motor circuits and could thereby provide primitive, perceptually triggered, action-oriented affective processing. Moods may be related to more recent overlying prefrontal neocortical elements and could thus provide more refined, complexly (perceptual, mnemonic, cognitive) triggered, cognition-oriented affective processing.",

      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) refers to a complex of cyclical and recurrent physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms that occur specifically in luteal phase and remain for minimum three consecutive menstrual cycles. Up to 80% of women of child bearing age report with few mild symptoms of PMS prior to menstruation. But clinically significant PMS is seen only in 3 to 8% of women. Its more severe form, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) has listed one among the Depressive mental disorders by American Psychiatric Association. Premenstrual Syndrome, an often neglecting medical condition due to social taboo of not discussing the issue of menstruation, was not considered as a disease earlier due to unawareness of the grave symptoms of the disease. Till now, the disease is a medical mystery with unknown cause and without any specific proved diagnosis and medication in modern medicine. This article is merely an attempt to relate PMS with Pittavritta Vyana Vata, which is an Avaranajanya Vyadhi. In Rituvyateetakala which is compared mainly with the luteal phase, there is Pittakopavastha and Vatasanchayavastha. With excess intake of Pittakar Nidan in Rituvyateetakala, Sanchita Vata specifically Vyana Vayu gets Avritta with Kupita Pitta and manifested in the form of Sarvanga Daha, Santapa, Klama etc. So the disease PMS can be managed and treated on the line of Pittavritta Vyana Vayu so as to provide relief from its deleterious effects and improve her family and social life.",

Cuenta con diversos sinonimos tales como: estado desconcertante agudo, sindrome de cerebro agudo, disfuncion mental, etc. La demencia es un sindrome definido por un deterioro cognitivo global con repercusion funcional, sin afectacion de la conciencia. Se caracteriza por un inicio gradual y curso progresivo. Puede ser dificil distinguir entre demencia y delirium debido a que muchas veces coexisten. Hasta un 50% de las demencias tienen un delirium asociado al ingreso y entre 25-50% de los pacientes con delirium tienen una demencia de base. Los principales rasgos para diferenciar ambos trastornos son: Inicio y curso: en el delirium los sintomas comienzan rapida y bruscamente, desarrollandose en horas o dias, mientras que en la demencia el curso es lentamente progresivo, de meses. Estado de la conciencia: en la demencia el individuo se mantiene alerta con poca o ninguna alteracion de la conciencia al contrario del delirium. En la actualidad, el delirio postoperatorio es una entidad bien definida (Cuadro I). La incidencia en ancianos va de 10% a 60%; en estudios recientes han incluido a las poblaciones quirurgicas oftalmicas, ortopedicas, y cardiacas. Diversos autores han destacado la correlacion del delirio postoperatorio con la hipoxemia perioperatoria y recomiendan la supervision electroencefalografica durante la cirugia(1-3). Se han realizado multiples esfuerzos para encontrar nuevas pruebas para un diagnostico temprano del delirio postoperatorio. La disfuncion mental transitoria tiene un importante efecto sobre la salud del paciente y por lo tanto se incrementan los costos para mantener el cuidado de ellos.

The clinical symptoms of these disturbances are as follows: The blood pressure becomes higher on a constant level, and at the same time one finds various signs of cardiac incompetence, especially during physical work, such as increase in the pulse rate, precordial uneasiness and, sometimes, dizziness. The accommodative power of the blood pressure becomes unsteady, as demonstrated by its irregular fluctuation. Therefore, an investigation into the complicated mechanism of the origin of high blood pressure in persons of presenile age is justified. The problem is important, since it is connected with many interesting questions of disease in human beings. The consideration of these questions may also bring",

Almost 50% deaf and mute patients diagnosed with psychosis report “hearing of voices which others cannot hear” in the absence of any external stimulus. Similar percentage of patients report visual and tactile hallucinations. The assessment of psychosis in such patients become difficult due to lack of tools and training of medical professionals in communication with such patients. There exists some literature which shows association in the neurobiology of auditory hallucinations and hearing impairment. The following case report illustrates a case of psychosis in a deaf and mute patient CASE REPORT A 17 years old unmarried female, not formally educated, unemployed, deaf and mute since birth with easy premorbid temperament no history of any comorbid illness and no family history of any psychiatric or neurological illness presented with insidious onset continuous course of total duration since last 1 year characterized by verbal and physical aggression, suspiciousness, muttering to self, hearing of voices that others cannot hear, odd behaviour, poor self care, decreased sleep. Patient was admitted due to unmanageability at home. On mental status examination, patient was agitated, violent towards herself and her family members.

When any or all of these factors are disrupted by a progressive dementia it is unsurprising that sexual ‘problems’ are identified. Most sexual behaviour ‘problems’ relate to expressions of normal sexuality complicated by changes in relationships, care needs and cognitive function, and complex ethical and legal considerations emerge. Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium. Evidence and approaches to assess and to manage sexual behaviour problems in dementia are discussed.",

      "title": "Recent Studies on Head-Shaking Nystagmus.",
      "abstract": "From recent literature, the clinical implications of head-shaking nystagmus (HSN) can be summarized as follows:1. HSN with more than four distinct consecutive beats is generally pathological, when observed using Frenzel's glasses in a dark room. However, HSN may be physiological only when the patient's vision is completely blocked such as when the patient's eyes are closed.2. Horizontal HSN may have a peripheral or central vestibular origin, but a distinct vertical (usually down beating) HSN strongly suggests a central lesion.3. HSN appears usually in a monophasic or biphasic pattern. The pattern which appears in peripheral vestibular disorders (PVD) depends mainly on the stage of recovery.4. The second phase of biphasic HSN is usually weaker in nystagmus intensity but longer in duration than the first phase in PVD. A second phase that is as strong or stronger than the first phase may suggest a central origin.5. In long-lasting PVD, HSN beats toward the normal ear in about 75% of monophasic cases and in more than 85% of biphasic cases in the first phase.6. In many cases with long-lasting PVD, both of spontaneous nystagmus (SPN) and HSN reverse their nystagmus directions during the course of the recovery in the following order: SPN toward the impaired ear (irritative nystagmus), SPN toward the normal ear (paretic nystagmus), monophasic HSN toward the normal ear, biphasic HSN in the first phase toward the normal ear, monophasic HSN toward the impaired ear, and finally SPN toward the impaired ear (recovery nystagmus).7. Biphasic HSN in which the nystagmus in the first phase beats toward the impaired ear (reversed biphasic HSN) is rarely encountered in long-lasting PVD. In Meniere's disease, on the other hand, this type of HSN is relatively common and amounts, when added with monophasic HSN toward the impaired ear (reversed monophasic HSN), to about 30% of cases.",

POIS can occur either after intercourse or masturbation, starting seconds to hours after having an orgasm, and can be lasted to 2 - 7 days. The prevalence and incidence of POIS itself are not certainly known.&#x0D; Reviews: Waldinger and colleagues were the first to report cases of POIS and later in establishing the diagnosis, they proposed 5 preliminary diagnostic criteria, also known as Waldinger's Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria (WPDC). Symptoms can vary from somatic to psychological complaints. The mechanism underlying this disease are not clear. Immune modulated mechanism is one of the hypothesis that is widely believed to be the cause of this syndrome apart from opioid withdrawal and disordered cytokine or neuroendocrine responses. POIS treatment is also not standardized. Treatments includeintra lymphatic hyposensitization of autologous semen, non-steroid anti-inflamation drugs (NSAIDs), steroids such as Prednisone, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, hormones (hCG and Testosterone), alpha-blockers, and other adjuvant medications.&#x0D; Summary: This syndrome still needs more research to understand its mechanisms to obtainclearer treatment. Besides that, the clinician's awareness is needed to recognize this syndrome so that it is not misdiagnosed.",

We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias.

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Abnormal motor and behavioral phenomena during sleep are part of a broader category of sleep behaviour disorder, which may manifest during different stages—either during sleep, wakefulness, or the transitions between these states. Such occurrences are particularly prevalent during early childhood, affecting approximately 15-20% of pediatric populations, while about 4% of adults experience similar events. These sleep disturbances are generally categorized into simple behaviors or more complex behaviors. Objectives This case report describes a clinical presentation involving defenestration in the context of parasomnia, with initial concerns about a possible suicide attempt. The objective is to highlight the diagnostic challenges in such cases and emphasize the importance of distinguishing between parasomnia-related behavior and intentional self-harm. Methods The patient is a 24-year-old male, born in the US, and currently living in Barcelona as part of a study exchange program. He has been consuming 1SCU of cannabis daily since adolescence. He denies any personal or family psychiatric history but reports experiencing episodes of sleepwalking during his childhood and teenage years. On presentation, the patient sustained multiple traumatic injuries following an accidental fall from a second-floor window. The event was witnessed by neighbors, who alerted emergency services. The patient has no memories of the event and denies suicidal intent. In the hours preceding the incident, the patient consumed approximately 2SDE of alcohol, but he denies the use of any other substances at the time. Additional testing, including CT of the brain and EEG, revealed no significant abnormalities. Results This case presents a diagnostic dilemma, as initial suspicions pointed toward a possible suicide attempt. However, the patient’s history of sleepwalking, especially during childhood, suggests a parasomnia-related etiology. It is crucial to differentiate between childhood-onset sleepwalking, which is often linked to genetic and developmental factors, and sleepwalking that persists or re-emerges in adulthood, which is more strongly associated with psychopathological factors. The persistence of parasomnias in adults may indicate an underlying psychiatric condition. Conclusions This case underscores the complexities in diagnosing parasomnias, particularly when severe and potentially dangerous behaviors are involved. While the patient’s history of sleepwalking and lack of psychiatry history suggest a parasomnia-related etiology, the persistence of such behaviors into adulthood warrants careful evaluation for underlying psychopathological factors. Early recognition and accurate diagnosis are paramount to providing effective care and preventing recurrence of such episodes. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating neurology and psychiatry to offer tailored interventions. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Severe breathholding spells in children follow a more or less constant clinical pattern, and the electroencephalogram is almost always normal. The spells generally appear during the first two years of life, but rarely before 6 months of age. They usually disappear spontaneously after 4 years of age and rarely recur after age 6 years. Breathholding episodes are observed almost exclusively in children with normal intelligence and do not cause demonstrable evidence of brain damage. However, they are frequently associated with or followed by behavioral disturbances. The familial incidence is high. Breathholding attacks are essentially innocuous and the general outlook is excellent. The associated unconsciousness and convulsions are very short and benign, and require no immediate care. The administration of antiepileptic or tranquilizing drugs or both is of no value. Treatment consists primarily of parent-child guidance and reassurance.",

      "abstract": "Severe acute adrenocortical insufficiency or adrenal crisis are often elusive diagnoses that may result in severe morbidity and mortality when undiagnosed or ineffectively treated. Although more than 50 steroids are produced within the adrenal cortex, cortisol and aldosterone are far the most abundant and physiologically active. In primary adrenocortical insufficiency, glucocorticoid and mineral-corticoid properties are lost; however, in secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (i.e., secondary to disease or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis), mineralocorticoid function is preserved. Every emergency physician should be familiar with adrenocortical insufficiency--a potentially life-threatening entity. The initial diagnosis and decision to treat are presumptive and are based on history, physical examination, and, occasionally, laboratory findings. Delay in treatment while attempting to confirm this diagnosis can result in poor patient outcomes. This article review data about physiology, pathophysiology of the adrenal cortex, physiologic effects of glucocorticoids, aldosterone, causes of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, frequency, clinical picture, laboratory and imaging studies of adrenal crisis, laboratory evaluation of adrenal function and emergency therapy, replacement therapy, mortality/morbidity of this pathology.",

      "title": "Influence of Sex Hormones in a Mouse Model of Multi Etiology Dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Up to 80% of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients suffer from concurrent vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) resulting in multi‐etiology dementia. VCID (the 2nd leading cause of dementia) is more common in men throughout most of the lifespan. while the majority (approximately 2/3) of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients are women. Ageing is a main dementia risk factor which may act through the depletion of sex hormones. Both testosterone, in men, and estrogen, in women, have been shown to be neuroprotective. In this study we examine the effect of gonadal hormones on cognitive changes in a mouse model of multi etiology dementia using the App NL‐F/NL‐F knock‐in Alzheimer’s disease mouse model that does not overexpress amyloid precursor protein. Methods 5‐6 months old App NL‐F/NL‐F mice were subjected to gonadectomy or sham surgery and left to recover for 3 weeks to clear any endogenous gonadal hormones. Multi‐etiology dementia was modeled using chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (unilateral carotid artery occlusion). Control animals ( App NL‐F/NL‐F without hypoperfusion; AD only model) received a sham surgery. Mice were then subjected to a battery of behavioral tests before being euthanized and then brains and serum were collected. Results Cognitive impairment differences between groups were investigated using several behavioral tests: anxiety‐like behavior and activity levels using an open field testing, episodic‐like memory using a novel object recognition test, spatial learning and memory via Barnes maze testing and activities of daily living using a nest building test. Our next step is to evaluate the underlying pathology in the brain that could mediate cognitive deficits (i.e. amyloid pathology, white matter damage and neuroinflammation). Conclusions We hope that this work will highlight the importance of modeling endocrine aging in animal models of dementia and will contribute to further understanding of sex differences and sex specific risk factors for dementia.",

In general, continued use of harmful substances is not intended to harm the fetus but rather a response to acute psychological or physical need. SUD is the most commonly missed and undertreated diagnosis during pregnancy. Survey-based estimates may underestimate substance abuse by as much as 50% or more. Childhood trauma is associated with development of psychiatric disorders, violence in personal relationships, and economic instability later in life and also plays a role in the development of SUD. Screening is the use of brief self-report instruments to identify substance use. The prevention of drug abuse is paramount to drug abuse treatment. Prevention strategies are focused on increasing public awareness of the harmful effects of drug use through advertising campaigns, school programs, and encouraging parents to educate their children. Substance use is an important component of the history in female patients seeking preconception counseling because fetal drug exposure is preventable.",

Symptoms of encopresis frequently begin after an illness. They can also result from psychosocial stressors, inappropriate toilet training, or in conjunction with a behavior disorder. Enuresis is an elimination disorder characterized by the repeated voiding of urine in inappropriate places (e.g., bed, clothing, floor) at least twice per week for 3 consecutive months. Enuresis can be specified as one of three types: nocturnal only, diurnal only, or nocturnal and diurnal.",

      "title": "Action myoclonus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and other cerebellar myoclonic syndromes.",
      "abstract": "Action myoclonus, reviewed in this chapter, is the term applied to arrhythmic muscular jerking induced by voluntary movement. It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.",

      "abstract": "Fifty clinically diagnosed cases of presenile dementia were reviewed retrospectively, noting recorded symptomatology and findings on mental status, neurological and ancillary examinations at the time of definitive diagnosis. Manifest symptoms were numerous and varied over time but not in any uniform fashion which would allow the identification of stages of illness. The most frequent symptom was change in personality or behavior (78 per cent of the sample) whereas the most consistent symptom longitudinally was impairment of memory (present in at least 50 per cent of patients over time). A significant association of patient age at the time of symptom onset and at first physician contact with the character of the presenting symptoms at these times was identified. When symptoms were characteristically psychiatric rather than neurological in nature, patients had significantly earlier onset and earlier physician contact. Formal mental status examinations were notable in their consistently high frequency of classical signs of organic brain syndrome. Manifestations of psychosis and of a catastrophic reaction were uncommon. Neurological examination was abnormal in 84 per cent of the sample, with the most frequent finding being the presence of one or more release reflexes. Pneumoencephalography or computerized cerebral axial tomography was abnormal in all cases, in part a function of selection criteria. Electroencephalography was abnormal in 69 per cent of 48 cases, showing diffuse slowing in all but two instances. A normal electroencephalogram was present significantly more often when cerebral atrophy was limited to the cortical surfaces than when ventricular dilatation was present. Release reflexes were found to be significantly more common among patients with an abnormal as opposed to a normal electroencephalogram. No significant correlations among pattern and degree of cerebral atrophy, findings on neurological examination, signs of organic brain syndrome, and patient age and sex were apparent. Interpretation and implications of the results are discussed. The variability of clinical findings among patients, as well as over time, makes the establishment of specific diagnostic criteria difficult and raises again the question of whether presenile dementia constitutes a distinct clinical entity in the absence of tissue diagnosis.",

These symptoms are easily recognized by the patient and that is why he knows that alcohol soothes them fast and then in order to avoid them he falls on drinking, thus the disease cycle continues, impairing his health.",

A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

An antidepressant discontinuation reaction was first reported in 1959 in association with imipramine, but it is now well established that this phenomenon occurs with most antidepressants.",

      "abstract": "Convulsions which occur within seconds of head impact, are an infrequent but dramatic accompaniment of concussive brain injury. These are often assumed to be epileptic seizures secondary to underlying brain injury however no published research has been presented to delineate this entity further. We performed a retrospective analysis of case records of club medical officers in elite Australian football competition over a 15 year period. A total of 25 episodes of concussive convulsions were obtained and all players were followed up. Eyewitness accounts of the episodes were sought from treating team physicians and in six cases TV videotape of sufficient quality was available to analyse the events in more detail. Ictal phenomenology revealed that all events were generalised seizures and occurred within 2 seconds of impact. The mean duration was 78 seconds and 75% had an initial tonic phase. Post event confusion lasted from 0 to 60 minutes however the presence of a coexisting concussive injury made post ictal assessment limited. All players had normal neuroimaging and follow up EEG's studies. The site of impact was facial in 60% of cases. All players returned to elite sport participation within two weeks of the episodes without sequelae. The clinical and neuropsychological outcomes have been universally good with no player developing epilepsy with a mean follow up of 3.5 years (range 1 - 13 years). These episodes have more in common with convulsive syncope than with post traumatic epilepsy. Experimental animal studies suggest that the mechanism may be a transient functional decerebration secondary to the impact, resulting in brainstem-generated convulsive movements. From a clinical standpoint, these episodes are non-epileptic in nature and hence anticonvulsants and prohibition from collision sport is unwarranted.",

      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

The overriding complex neurological control is also important. A disorder of any of these may lead to faecal incontinence. This can affect over 10% of adults and at least 1–2% of patents will report these as major symptoms. In itself, faecal incontinence is not a disease but a symptom and it is necessary to take a full history and examine a patient to identify any underlying diseases or pathology that may need treatment before focusing on managing incontinence. The aim of any treatment for faecal incontinence is to improve the patient’s quality of life and give them some control back over their bowel function. Constipation is an increasing problem in the Western world and it is widely accepted that approximately 50% of adults are constipated at any point in time. Constipation encompasses a multitude of symptoms; the general mental health and social functioning of people with constipation is impaired when compared to health controls. The symptoms of constipation occur in a large percentage of the general population. The impact on quality of life when they occur for a long period of time is large. However, patients often have many coexisting other pelvic floor disorders. Although there are surgical options available, it is important to treat conservatively and understand the complexity of the other issues involved in patients presenting with constipation.",

Both biological and psychological factors are intertwined in many cases. Psychological reactions to SDs often result in a vicious circle that perpetuates it. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is often multifactorial. It may be the first manifestation of atherosclerosis, a marker of occult coronary artery disease, and a harbinger for cardiovascular events. It may also reveal hypogonadism and hyperprolactinemia. Psychological factors are almost constant. Addressing vascular risk factors and comorbidities is essential in ED patients. Hypogonadism requires testosterone therapy. Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) are safe and effective first-choice treatments. Local and surgical therapies are available for when former treatments fail or are not tolerated. The hypothesis of a genetic predisposition to lifelong premature ejaculation (PE) due to polymorphisms of several genes influencing the neurological pathways controlling ejaculation is partly supported by twin studies and by candidate gene assessment. Drug-induced, endocrine, and urological factors might be involved in some cases of acquired PE. Psychological factors are present in most cases. No evidence supports the efficacy of psychological therapies. Off-label long-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, dapoxetine, and local anesthetics are effective and safe symptomatic therapies. Combined treatments may be the future. There are presently no symptomatic treatments for the other male SDs, i.e. hypoactive sexual desire, delayed ejaculation, other orgasmic dysfunctions, and dyspareunia, that are less frequent than ED and PE.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

The early psychoanalytic formulations of Abraham<sup>1</sup>and Freud<sup>2</sup>of the depressive reaction long ago became identified with the notions of self-accusation, guilt, and selfdestruction, so that nearly every depressive reaction was viewed either as resulting from or including the turning of the original object-directed aggression against the self, or from the internalized aggression against the incorporated loved and hated object. In such depressed patients, the tendency to express aggression against others has been seen as either denied, suppressed, or repressed, and hostile feelings toward the significant other not admitted into awareness where they would arouse painful guilt feelings. One more recent psychoanalytic position<sup>3</sup>is that depression is associated with denial, or repression of aggression, aimed at preserving the original love object",

      "abstract": "In according to World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, addiction is mentally and sometimes physical condition generated by interaction between living organism and addiction resources (medium). It is characterized by behavior and other mental process which involve coercion for occasional or regular use of addiction resources with intention to experience it's effect on mental process or to avoid discomfort due to absence of such a resource (medium). Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort. Physical addiction is defined as a condition of adjustment on drugs followed by need for increase of dose to achieve its effect as it was in the beginning with smaller quantity and with occurrence of abstinence crisis in absence of drugs. Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living. Such different addictions have and different importance, influence and consequences and addiction does not have to be necessarily negative phenomenon although it is mostly considered and judged as such. Depriving of stimulant, bring to crisis similar to ones found in physical addiction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Consider this question. Have you worried a lot over the past month? Answering ‘yes’ may indicate that you are just experiencing normal concern about the usual tribulations oflife. Alternatively, your worrying may be an indicator that you have a mental disorder. Establishing whether worrying is a symptom of a psychiatric disorder, or merely a normal experience, requires answers to a number of supplementary questions such as ‘What’s it like when you worry?’ ‘Can you turn your attention to anything else?’ and ‘How much of the time over the past month have you worried?’ When worrying becomes a recurrent and painful round of thoughts, so that it is difficult to turn your attention to anything else and takes up much of your time, then your worrying is more likely to be a symptom of a mental disorder (Wing et al. 1974).",

Describe the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of apnea.\n\n3. Characterize the findings of long-term follow-up of infants who have apnea.\n\nAlthough apnea typically results from immaturity of the respiratory control system (see accompanying article in this issue), it also may be the presenting sign of other diseases or pathophysiologic states that frequently affect preterm infants. A thorough consideration of possible causes is always warranted, especially when there is an unexpected increase in the frequency of episodes of apnea or bradycardia (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \nMultiple etiologic factors that may contribute to apnea in preterm infants. IVH=intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\n\n\nCentral nervous system problems, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, can precipitate apnea in the preterm infant. Asphyxia, including transient birth depression, may cause either episodic or prolonged apnea. Malformations of the brain or less likely, the spinal cord, should be considered in an otherwise healthy infant who presents with apnea at birth. Infections (bacteremia possibly accompanied by meningitis) may cause unstable breathing patterns and should prompt the appropriate evaluation and possibly antibiotic therapy. In the older infant, the onset of a viral illness such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection sometimes is heralded by apnea, although the precise mechanism whereby RSV presents with apnea is unclear. Anemia, another frequent problem in preterm infants, whether iatrogenic or due to bleeding, is a potential precipitating factor. Blood transfusions have been demonstrated to improve irregular breathing patterns in preterm infants, although the risk of blood transfusion has limited its use as treatment for apnea. It has been assumed, although unproven, that enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity, as with red blood cell transfusion, may decrease the likelihood of hypoxia-induced respiratory depression. Other disease states that may precipitate apnea include metabolic disorders such as …",

      "title": "Urology",
      "abstract": "The topics in this chapter are as follows: Bedwetting (Nocturnal enuresis = NE), Frequent urination, Dysuria and Polyuria. Bedwetting Misdiagnosis is due to failing to differentiate between monosymptomatic and complicated NE, and failing to recognize other causes of nocturnal enuresis, blood in urine, dysuria, and polyuria. Bedwetting presents either in isolation (monosymptomatic enuresis = MSE) or in association with urinary tract infection (UTI), vulvovaginitis, daytime incontinence, urge, hesitancy, straining symptoms of urination, postvoid dribbling or dysfunctional voiding (non-monosymptomatic enuresis = NMSE). NE is divided into primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and secondary nocturnal enuresis (SNE) (restarting bedwetting after a previous dry period >6 months) in 20% of children. The chapter discusses diagnostic criteria of monosymptomatic NE and differentiating it from other conditions causing nocturnal enuresis including compulsive drinking, type 1 diabetes and diabetes insipidus. Blood in urine Misdiagnosis is due to failing to differentiate blood from other blood-appearing substances in the urine, failing to recognize pathologies causing blood in urine in neonates, and in older children. When a child presents with blood in urine, doctors should determine that it is actually haematuria? Red staining of the nappy can be due to either true blood with RBCs or urates. Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn should be excluded. Nephrocalcinosis is not uncommon in premature babies and it can be seen in up to 40 days of life. The detection of proteinuria in association with haematuria is very suggestive of renal origin of the haematuria such as glomerulonephritis. Pathologies causing haematuria in older children include post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is the most common cause of gross haematuria worldwide. Other topics discussed include urinary tract infection; renal stones, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, renal tumour. Nephroblastoma is the most common urological malignancy in children. Schistosomiasis occurs in many countries, e.g. Egypt. Frequent urination Misdiagnosis is due to failing to establish characteristics of frequent urination and differentiating it from continuous urination and polyuria. The term indicates frequent urination more than 7–8 times a day in older children, The condition needs to be differentiated from continuous dribbling due to posterior urethral valve obstruction in boys, and ectopic ureter in girls. Diagnostic criteria of both conditions are discussed. Dysuria Misdiagnosis is due to failing to recognize that dysuria can exist in infancy, failing to establish common underlying causes of painful urination Dysuria in infancy: Painful urination may occur due to urethritis caused by infection, as idiopathic urethritis, hypercalciuria, or part of Reiter's syndrome (associated with conjunctivitis, polyarthritis), or due to nappy dermatitis affecting the foreskin of the penis. Underlying causes of dysuria in older children are discussed. Urinary incontinence Misdiagnosis is due to failing to consider basic knowledge on urinary incontinence, and failing to establish important secondary causes of urinary incontinence. Basic knowledge of urinary incontinence and their underlying causes of urinary are discussed. Labial fusion is another cause and is common affecting about 3% of pre-pubertal girls Polyuria Misdiagnosis is due to failing to define the diagnosis of polyuria, to differentiate the main causes of polyuria, including diabetes, compulsive drinking, diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis and hypercalcaemia. Polyuria in children results from either a water or solute diuresis. Polydipsia indicates excessive water intake, which is defined in this section. Diagnostic criteria of diabetes type 1 and diabetes insipidus (DI) are discussed. The most important differential diagnosis is between compulsive drinking and DI. Diagnostic criteria of compulsive drinking and renal tubular acidosis are provided. Urinary Retention/inability to pass urine Misdiagnosis is due to failing to distinguish oliguria and anuria from urine retention, and not differentiating the main causes of urine retention. Urine retention indicates an inability to empty the bladder for >12 h with a normal or increased urine volume, or a palpable distended bladder. Causes include bladder neck or urethral obstruction. Oliguria in infants is a urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/h per 24 h. In older children and adults oliguria is <400/day. This quantity (usually resulting from dehydration in children) is insufficient to excrete the daily osmolar load. Causes of reduced urine output or retention in neonates and in older children are discussed.",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "title": "Recovery of central and peripheral neuromuscular fatigue after exercise",
      "abstract": "Sustained physical exercise leads to a reduced capacity to produce voluntary force that typically outlasts the exercise bout. This \"fatigue\" can be due both to impaired muscle function, termed \"peripheral fatigue,\" and a reduction in the capacity of the central nervous system to activate muscles, termed \"central fatigue.\" In this review we consider the factors that determine the recovery of voluntary force generating capacity after various types of exercise. After brief, high-intensity exercise there is typically a rapid restitution of force that is due to recovery of central fatigue (typically within 2 min) and aspects of peripheral fatigue associated with excitation-contraction coupling and reperfusion of muscles (typically within 3-5 min). Complete recovery of muscle function may be incomplete for some hours, however, due to prolonged impairment in intracellular Ca2+ release or sensitivity. After low-intensity exercise of long duration, voluntary force typically shows rapid, partial, recovery within the first few minutes, due largely to recovery of the central, neural component. However, the ability to voluntarily activate muscles may not recover completely within 30 min after exercise. Recovery of peripheral fatigue contributes comparatively little to the fast initial force restitution and is typically incomplete for at least 20-30 min. Work remains to identify what factors underlie the prolonged central fatigue that usually accompanies long-duration single joint and locomotor exercise and to document how the time course of neuromuscular recovery is affected by exercise intensity and duration in locomotor exercise. Such information could be useful to enhance rehabilitation and sports performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Suicide attempt, and particularly completed suicide are relatively rare events in the community, but they are very common among psychiatric patients. Since over 90% of suicide victims suffer from (mostly untreated) current major mental disorders (particularly from major depressive episode), psychiatric risk factors are the clinically most useful predictors, especially if psychosocial and demographic risk factors are also pesent. Violent behaviours associated with mood disorders constitute a related yet independently also important aspect of this illness, and assessment and management of violence is a key component of everyday psychiatric practice. While most people with current mental disorder are not violent, violence is more common among seriously mentally ill individuals than in healthy persons. This is particularly true for untreated schizophrenics and untreated patients with major mood disorders, first of all in the cases of comorbid substance use disorders, mainly among those with current mania or postpartum depression. Although specific clinical studies are lacking, it is very lilely that successful acute and long-tem treatment of mood disorders can reduce the risk of violent behaviour in this patient population.",

We report a case that shared the clinical features of both disorders. A 62-year-old woman presented with attacks consisting of brief tonic posturing of four limbs, more prominent on the right side. The attack started at age 59 and subsequently began to occur about 20 times daily. Her consciousness was preserved during the attack. The attack lasted 5-15 sec. The attacks were often evoked by sudden initiation of movement, but also occurred spontaneously and even during sleep. She had never experienced generalized convulsion. Ictal scalp EEG showed high amplitude beta activity appearing a few seconds before the attacks around the vertex. Otherwise EEG was within normal limits. The response to anti-convulsant medication was poor and a combination of three kinds of drugs was needed. An almost identical case was reported as \"PKC\" by Lombroso. His case showed unequivocal epileptiform discharges arising from the supplementary motor area. Accordingly, our case is considered kinesigenic SMS.

      "title": "Suicide in adolescence",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Suicide is a violent action directed at the person's own body. This action is motivated by a fantasy and as such is defined as a break with reality which constitutes a psychotic episode. Adolescence is considered next, and is seen as a period during which radical changes take place in the person's relationship to his or her body. The fact that suicide attempts in young people almost always first occur after puberty has been reached is then used to show the meaning of the suicidal act as a violent attack on the adolescent's new sexual body. Insofar as this holds for every suicide attempt, however minor, the argument is put forward that a suicide attempt is always a sign of serious disruption and deadlock in the adolescent's development to normal adulthood. In order to help the adolescent with the developmental deadlock the need for regular, and in particular long-term, psychoanalytic psychotherapy is stressed as a matter of urgency in order to avoid later pathological development from taking place.",

      "abstract": "Sleep structure is qualitatively and quantitatively changed by aging. The elderly usually go to bed in early evening and wake up in early morning, and they also take several naps in the day time. The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly. However, insomnia following the mental disturbance (depression), chronic use of drug or alcohol, dementia (vascular or Alzheimer type) are also important in the elderly. Sleep apnea syndrome is recently found as an important cause of insomnia. Concerning the treatment and prevention of insomnia, it is necessary to exclude the causes of insomnia, to improve the environmental conditions and to keep the regular rhythm of sleep-wake cycle. It is also important to carefully select and use the adequate hypnotics considering the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drugs in the elderly.",

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

Its etiology is still unclear, and the clinical presentation is quite heterogeneous, manifesting itself through obsessions and/or compulsions that are associated with high levels of anxiety and time consumption. Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities. Conclusion It is essential to implement strategies for effective communication between both medical specialities, and aim to prevent occupational risks, by protecting and promoting healthy workplaces.

      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunctions related to psychotropic drugs are among the most distressing adverse effects and can lead to non-adherence to treatment. Objectives To elucidate the mechanisms of psychotropic-induced sexual dysfunctions and to suggest strategies for their management. Methods Literature review based on the keywords “psychotropics,” “sexuality,” and “sexual dysfunction”. Results Psychotropic medications can impact sexuality either directly or indirectly. The direct effect is primarily due to a decrease in the mesocortical dopaminergic atmosphere, either by blocking D2 receptors or by stimulating 5HT2A receptors. D2 receptor blockade in the tubero-infundibular pathway triggers an increase in prolactin secretion, which can subsequently lead to erection problems, decreased libido, and difficulties achieving orgasm. Action in the nigrostriatal pathway may result in an extrapyramidal syndrome, which can, in turn, hinder intimate physical relations. The indirect effect can also be caused by metabolic complications, which are significant risk factors for sexual dysfunction, as they can lead to male hypogonadism and a negative self-image. Therapeutic strategies suggest either reducing doses (if the patient’s condition allows), changing the drug, or adding an adjunctive medication. Aripiprazole, being a partial agonist of D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist of D3 and 5-HT2A receptors, appears to cause fewer sexual dysfunctions and can reduce hyperprolactinemia when added to other antipsychotics. Conclusions Healthcare professionals must proactively gather information on sexuality given its impact on quality of life and treatment adherence. Prioritizing this dimension of well-being demonstrates a respectful approach toward the patient and establishes the foundation for a strong therapeutic alliance.

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

La enfermedad\r\ncon frecuencia se presenta inicialmente en adultos jovenes, alrededor de los 20\r\nanos de edad, siendo mas frecuente en mujeres que en hombres (1.5-3:1).\r\nRepresenta uno de los diagnosticos mas comunes en la practica clinica diaria\r\nen un 12%. Este sindrome puede ocurrir a cualquier edad, pero a menudo\r\ncomienza en la adolescencia o principios de la vida adulta. El tratamiento del\r\nSII como padecimiento multifactorial, es complejo y de dificil manejo que en la\r\nmayoria de ocasiones no tiene resultados satisfactorios. La acupuntura en\r\ncambio tiene un efecto analgesico bien reconocido e incide en varias\r\nestructuras y funciones del sistema nervioso central, promoviendo la secrecion\r\nde multiples neurotransmisores y la respuesta autonomica a traves del\r\nsimpatico y para simpatico, controlando asi las funciones viscerales como la\r\nmotilidad y la secrecion gastrointestinal. Metodo: El estudio se realizo en el\r\nconsultorio del CECYT 12 del Instituto Politecnico Nacional, se elaboro una\r\nhistoria clinica a los profesores que cumplieron con los criterios de inclusion, se\r\nles elaboro y firmaron la carta de consentimiento informado. Se formaron dos\r\ngrupos en forma aleatoria, de 25 pacientes cada uno, a todos los sujetos se les\r\nvaloro el dolor con escala de EVA al inicio y al final de la sesion, y se les cito\r\ndos veces por semana. Resultados: en el periodo de abril a octubre de 2011 se\r\ncaptaron un total de 50 profesores, en el CECyT 12 del IPN, de los cuales el\r\n88% son de sexo femenino y solo el 12% sexo masculino, no hubo pacientes\r\neliminados. Se obtuvo una P<0.05 en la valoracion del dolor con escala de\r\nEVA, ya que el dolor bajo en 2-3 puntos a partir de la 5a sesion en adelante\r\nhasta llegar a 0 en la 10a semana de tratamiento, mostrando diferencias\r\nestadisticamente significativas. Conclusiones: La aguja larga es mas eficaz que\r\nla acupuntura ficticia en la disminucion del dolor en el sindrome de intestino\r\nirritable al ser aplicada en profesores del IPN sin la modificacion de habitos\r\nalimenticios y ocupacionales en grupos de pacientes que no ingerian algun otro\r\ntratamiento para tal patologia.",

      "title": "Suvremeno liječenje paničnog poremećaja",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "title": "Convulsive Status Epilepticus in Infants and Children",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Two hundred and thirty‐nine cases of status epilepticus in children 0–15 years old have been studied. Generalized tonic‐clonic and unilateral clonic convulsions constituted the bulk of cases. Status is mostly observed in young infants since 37% of all cases occurred in the first year, 73% in the first 3 years and 85% before 5 years of age. In only 23% of the patients did brief convulsions precede the episode of status epilepticus. Conversely seizures were noticed after status in almost three quarters of patients followed for one year or more. One half of our cases were apparently due to organic brain damage, either acute or chronic, the remaining half had no recognized etiological factors. More than half of these cryptogenic cases were related to non‐specific febrile episodes. The prognosis of children's status epilepticus is grave, mental or neurological residua or both being present in at least 57% of our patients. Approximately one half of these children had had normal development prior to their bout of convulsions. Gross brain damage was the main cause of status below 6 months of age, whereas cryptogenic convulsions predominated during the second year. Most of these cases were associated with fever. It is suggested that status epilepticus is capable of causing brain damage whatever its cause and that many cryptogenic episodes of febrile status are but the most severe cases in the spectrum of febrile convulsions. RÉSUMÉ Deux cents trente‐neuf cas d'état de mal épileptique chez l'enfant de 0–15 ans ont étéétudiées. Les crises généralisées tonico‐cloniques et les crises cloniques unilatérales sont la majorité. L'état de mal est surtout fréquent chez l'enfant jeune, 37% des cas survenant dans la premiére année, 73% avant trois ans et 85% avant cinq ans. L'état de mal n'a été précédé de convulsions courtes que dans 23% des cas. A l'inverse des crises aprés l'état de mal ont ete notées chez prés de trois quarts des malades suivis un an ou plus. La moitié de nos cas semble due à une atteinte cérebrale organique, aigüe ou chronique, l'autre moitié de ces états n'ayant pas de cause reconnue. Plus de la moitié de ces états de mal cryptogenétiqués étaient en relation avec des infections banales n'intéressant pas primitivement le cerveau. Le pronostic de l'état de mal épileptique de l'enfant est grave, puisque des séquelles mentales ou neurologiques étaient présentes chez 57% de nos enfants. Chez à peu prés la moitié de ceux‐ci le développement neuro‐psychique avait été normal jusqu'à l'état de mal. Avant l'âge de 6 mois les lésions organiques sont la cause commune des états de mal alors que les formes idiopathiques sont prédominates dans la seconde anneé, le plus souvent en association avec de la fiévre. l'état de mal épileptique semble capable á lui seul de créer des lésions cérébrates définitives quelle que soit sa cause. Nombre d'états de mal fébriles ne seraient que la forme extrême des convulsions fébriles.",

It is not clear whether the different case definitions have different implications for aetiology or prognosis. Paediatric CFS/ME is defined in the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidelines as \"generalised fatigue persisting after routine tests and investigations have failed to identify an obvious underlying cause\".8 The NICE recommended that the fatigue should have lasted 3 months before a diagnosis is made and highlighted the fact that the fatigue must be disabling and was likely to occur in the presence of one other symptom7 (box 1). There is a philosophical discussion to be had on how diagnoses are made, particularly with diagnoses where no underlying pathogen has been identified, but it can be argued that \"delineation of a syndrome is the first step towards elucidation of the chain of causation and redefinition of the whole group or subgroups within it\".9 Box 1 ### Definitions for chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in children and young people Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health definition of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2007 guidelines7",

It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

      "title": "Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The role of mood stabilizers",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with symptoms that extend far beyond cognitive deficits. The most distressing of these symptoms are known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and include delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression, misidentification, and sexually inappropriate behaviors. As a result of BPSD, AD patients suffer a poorer quality of life, as do their caregivers.1 Behavioral and psychological symptoms can be so distressing to the caregiver that they are a common reason for families placing their loved ones in long-term care. Approximately 60% and 80% of dementia patients living in the community and in long-term care settings develop BPSD, respectively.1Aggression and agitation are characterized by increased or disruptive psychomotor activity, inappropriate verbal activity, or disorganized motor activity that is not explained by the patient's needs. Often times, dementia patients present with aggression and agitation as well as psychotic symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have been the most widely studied agents for the management of psychotic symptoms as well as aggression and agitation.1 Despite their noted efficacy for BPSD, their use has been curtailed over recent years due to concerns about an increase in cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with their use. This has led to an ongoing search for other effective pharmacologic treatments for BPSD. Several mood stabilizers including valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate have been studied in dementia patients. This paper aims to present the data on the efficacy of mood stabilizing drugs for the management of BPSD.In 2007, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) developed a white paper on the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia for the purpose of treating psychosis and agitation.1 This paper also reviewed the use of numerous other psychotropic drugs in this population. Evidence for atypical antipsychotic efficacy in psychosis of dementia indicated that these agents have modest efficacy. The data are difficult to interpret because these studies often included patients with psychosis and agitation. To further complicate the studies, the primary outcome was often a measure of global psychiatric symptoms, not a rating scale to assess psychosis or agitation only. There have been very few studies evaluating the use of atypical antipsychotics for agitation only. This is partly due to the fact it is difficult to recruit dementia patients with agitation only since it frequently overlaps with psychosis. Agents such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have reportedly shown some benefit for agitation in dementia patients.Nearly 10 years ago, the FDA issued a warning regarding cerebrovascular events (CVEs) such as strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) associated with the use of risperidone. Soon after, the FDA evaluated CVE's with other atypical antipsychotics and the warning was added to olanzapine and aripiprazole. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data indicated that the rates of CVEs were 1.9% for patients receiving atypical antipsychotics and 0.9% for placebo-treated patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–2.8). Of course there are limitations to these data, most notably of which is that these studies were not powered to evaluate the relationship between drug and adverse events; they were powered to evaluate efficacy. In addition, the definition of CVE is not defined in the studies, nor were these events validated. Lastly, there is likely no difference in the rates of CVEs between typical and atypical agents.In addition to the risk of CVEs, increased mortality rates in the elderly have been reported with atypical antipsychotics. These data led the FDA to issue a black box warning for antipsychotics in the elderly regarding the higher mortality rates, which were mostly due to cardiac or infectious disease. A meta-analysis reported that the elderly mortality rate was 3.5% with atypical agents compared to 2.3% with placebo. Again, there were numerous limitations cited including limited data regarding the circumstances around the deaths as well as controversy surrounding the mortality risk in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.The study known as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness for Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) evaluated the use of antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients under naturalistic conditions.2 Patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of treatment for any reason as well as minimal improvement as noted on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks. Patients reportedly discontinued quetiapine due to lack of efficacy after a mean of only 9.1 weeks compared to olanzapine and risperidone where patients continued treatment for a mean of 22.1 and 26.7 weeks, respectively. Patients discontinued all treatments earlier than placebo due to adverse events.In addition to reporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and agitation, the ACNP white paper also reported on the use of other psychotropic drugs for these symptoms.1 There were three trials that evaluated the efficacy of VPA for agitation or aggression in dementia patients.3–5 Two of the studies were completed in patients with agitation and one with patients with aggression. All three studies failed to show any benefit of VPA over placebo for management of aggression or agitation. Additionally, two trials evaluated the short-term (6 week) use of carbamazepine (CBZ) for agitation. Both CBZ trials were small (n of 51 and 21), and reported mixed results. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores indicated that CBZ was more effective than placebo in one study7 but no difference was found in the other.6 Olin and colleagues actually reported that there was a significant improvement on the hostility item of the BPRS but a worsening of the hallucination item in CBZ-treated patients.6 The authors also reported that their study lacked statistical power and that they would have needed 69 patients in order to confirm the findings regarding the total BPRS scores.6Unfortunately, the long-term use of CBZ is limited by its poor tolerability, including ataxia and disorientation, and the risk of significant drug-drug interactions.Since the publication of the ACNP white paper, there has been one further study that evaluated the efficacy of VPA in agitation and aggression.8 This study included patients with moderate to severe AD and were experiencing agitation or aggression based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scores (NPI). Patients had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV)9 criteria for AD, have a mini-mental status exam (MMSE) score of < 15, and an NPI > 8. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 2 week wash-out period. Forty patients were referred, but consent was obtained from only 16. Two patients dropped out prior to enrollment, leaving 14 in the study (8M, 6F). Prior to starting the study, patients underwent a wash-out of current psychotropic medications for a period equal to 5 half-lives of the drugs. Treatment was initiated with VPA 125 mg twice per day for one week and increased to 500 mg twice per day during week two. The dose was increased according to symptom response and patient tolerability to a maximum of 1,500 mg per day. The dose could be decreased, as needed. Loxapine 2.5 mg up to 4 doses per week was permitted as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was the NPI agitation score. Secondary measures were the NPI total score and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Wilcoxon signed ranks tests comparing the change in scores for VPA vs. placebo.The results indicated that the NPI agitation scores decreased for VPA-treated patients and increased for placebo-treated patients (1.43+/−3.87 vs-2.08 +/−4.05, p=0.043). The change in scores for the VPA group represents a worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was also seen on the total NPI and CMAI scores, but was significant only for the CMAI (NPI p=0.075 and CMAI p=0.039). Twelve VPA patients had adverse effects such as falls (5), sedation (4), thrombocytopenia (2), and loose stools (2). The placebo group had 2 patients with sedation and 1 fall. The conclusion is that VPA was ineffective for agitation and aggression and was poorly tolerated in elderly AD patients.A second study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of VPA for preventing agitation and aggression in AD patients.10 Patients had to meet criteria for possible or probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke AND the Alzheimer's Diseaseand Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA), have a MMSE of 12–20, and be free from agitation or psychosis as defined by NPI < 1 on items assessing delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm flexible-dose study. Patients received VPA for two years in a double-blind fashion, and then had a two-month, single-blind placebo treatment period. The VPA target dose was 10–12 mg/kg and used identical appearing VPA and placebo tablets. The primary outcome was defined as the development of a score of at least 3 on one or more NPI items assessing delusions, hallucinations, and agitation for 2 weeks. Other scales used to assess secondary outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), CMAI, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living), the Quality of Life-AD, and the ADCS Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary endpoint was evaluated using the cox proportional hazards model comparing time to end point in the drug and placebo groups and adjusted for variables such as age, sex, baseline MMSE, total NPI, total CMAI, and ADCS-Activities of Daily Living. All assessments were completed at baseline, and every three months until the 24th month, then at month 26. Five hundred thirteen patients were screened and 313 were randomized. At enrollment, the mean MMSE in both groups was 16.9 and the NPI subscales for agitation, delusions, and hallucinations were < 1.0. The mean modal dose of VPA was 250 mg/day and the mean VPA level at 12 months was 42.7 mcg/ml. Sixty-one percent of VPA and 62% of placebo patients discontinued treatment early. The time to the primary endpoint did not differ between the two groups (p=0.88). Twenty-nine placebo and 25 VPA patients reached the endpoint. The mean change in ADAS-cog scores indicated that there were some differences that favored placebo (VPA 9.4, PLC 6.8, p=0.01). The ADCS Activities of Daily Living scores at 18 months also favored placebo (VPA-19.3, PLC-14.4, p=0.02). More VPA than placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (16% vs 7.5%). This study failed to show any benefit of VPA in preventing the development of agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.Due to the intolerability and drug interactions noted in carbamazepine trials as well as the lack of efficacy reported with VPA, other mood stabilizers have been evaluated for controlling BPSD. Topiramate (TOP) is a viable option secondary to its reported efficacy in controlling irritability and aggression in other psychiatric populations.11 However, there is concern with the use of TOP in the dementia population due to cognitive decline reported with its use.To date, there is only one published, prospective trial of TOP for aggression in dementia patients.12 This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing topiramate to risperidone (RIS) that included 48 patients with mild to moderate severity of AD defined by an MMSE score of 10–26. Patients were included if they had a complaint of behavioral disturbances and had an NPI score of greater than 1 in sub-items relating to delusions; hallucinations; agitation and aggression; and irritability and lability. Topiramate was initiated at 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks. Risperidone was initiated at 0.25 mg/day with a doubling in dose every week until target dose of 2 mg/day was achieved. In both groups, the dose could be reduced if adverse events occurred. The mean daily dose of TOP was 44.0 mg and RIS was 1.9 mg. Any improvement on NPI parts 1 and 2 or the CMAI were considered the primary outcomes. Part 1 of the NPI assesses behavioral disturbances and affective and psychotic symptoms; part 2 assesses caregiver burden and distress. Cognitive function was assessed with the MMSE.Forty eight patients were enrolled, but 41 completed the trial. Seven patients dropped out due to adverse events; fatigue and loss of appetite were reported in the TOP group and GI disturbance and akathisia in the RIS group. Both groups showed improvements in the NPI parts 1 and 2 from baseline to week 8. However, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups (NPI part I: P<0.575, NPI part 2: P<0.456). Both groups also showed a decrease in agitation as assessed by CMAI scores but no statistically significant difference noted (P<0.927). Cognitive status on the MMSE was not found to change significantly in either group (P<0.479). In conclusion, the authors found that low dose TOP had comparable efficacy to RIS in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia. However, nearly 15% failed to complete the study due to adverse events.Carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating BPSD, but carries a high risk for adverse events and drug-drug interactions.1 Oxcarbazepine(OXC) has been hypothesized to be efficacious as it has a similar structure to carbamazepine, but with better tolerability. There are case reports suggesting that oxcarbazepine may be beneficial in treating BPSD. To formally evaluate the efficacy of OXC for BPSD, an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with a diagnosis of AD, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia was conducted.13 This study included patients with moderate to severe dementia as defined by a MMSE of 0–20, a history of agitation or aggression for at least 1 week, a score of 6 or greater on Neurospychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) subscale for agitation and aggression, and were in a nursing home for at least 4 weeks. Patients who were receiving psychotropic medications prior to the study could not have dose changes within 2 weeks before and throughout the study. New psychotropic agents could not be initiated during the study except for haloperidol if needed as a rescue medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive OXC 300–900 mg/day or placebo. Oxcarbazepine was initiated at 75 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening with dose increases up to a total of 900 mg/day after 3 weeks with the highest, well-tolerated dose maintained. The mean daily dose of OXC was 536.6 mg/day. The primary outcome was the change in the agitation and aggression subscore of NPI-NH. Secondary outcomes included change in agitation measured by the Brief Agitation Rating Scale (BARS) and change in burden of care measured by NPI-NH.A total of 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication with 83 patients completing the study. No significant difference was found between groups for any of the outcomes assessed regardless of whether the intention to treat or per protocol population analysis was used (NPI-NH agitation and aggression subscore P=0.70, BARS P=0.07, NPI-NH P=0.58). Interestingly, there was also no significant difference between groups in the use of haloperidol (P=0.26). The most common side effects occurring in the active treatment group included urinary tract infections, falls, a decrease in serum sodium, ataxia, fainting, and sedation. In conclusion, the study failed to show any benefit of OXC for the management of agitation or aggression in patients with moderate to severe dementia.There have been some smaller, open studies and case studies published on this topic involving other mood stabilizers not already mentioned in this review. A recent case series showed benefit with low dose gabapentin 200–600 mg/day in treating aggressive behavior in seven patients with the vascular or mixed dementia.14 Gabapentin was well tolerated and produced sustained results at follow up varying from 2–6 months.14Lamotrigine has shown to be effective and well-tolerated over six months in a case report of a patient diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia who was demonstrating verbal and physical aggression.15 Another case series of five patients with dementia, manic-like symptoms, and agitation treated with lamotrigine reported improvements on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) after five months of treatment.16 None of the patients had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events.Two small, open-label trials with less than 20 patients each reported the effectiveness of levetiracetam for the management of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Both trials found significant improvement from baseline in the NPI and YMRS.17,18 One report indicated that three patients required a dose reduction of levetiracetam as two patients experienced lethargy and one had an increase in agitation.17 The second study noted that no patient had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, but did not mention if any dose reductions were required.18Since the publication of the ACNP White Paper in 2007, there have only been three randomized clinical trials studying mood stabilizers for treatment of BPSD. Low-dose TOP and RIS were reported to be equally effective for BPSD. Prospective, placebo-controlled trials of OXC and VPA failed to show any benefit in patients with BPSD. Open trials and case studies have shown some limited effectiveness for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam and require further evaluation in a controlled setting.Due to a paucity of data indicating efficacy and safety, no mood stabilizer is currently FDA approved for the management of BPSD. If a mood stabilizer is indicated for patients with dementia showing aggressive or agitated behavior, their use should only be considered in cases where the symptoms pose serious risk to the patient or their caregivers. Antipsychotics have the most data indicating some moderate efficacy for BPSD, but their use is associated with serious adverse events, like CVEs, and an increased mortality in the elderly. Carbamazepine also has reported mixed efficacy but is associated with poor tolerability and a risk of drug-drug interactions. Gabapentin, lamotrigine and levetiracetam may hold promise, but further research using placebo controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made with these agents. Overall, no single pharmacologic agent has shown efficacy and tolerability in the elderly patient with BPSD. Their use should be carefully considered on an individual basis in patients with clearly identified target symptoms followed by close monitoring for improvement.",

      "title": "Non‐surgical management of erectile dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Male erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to attain and maintain erection of the penis sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse. Desire (sexual interest directed towards the partner), sex drive (the mental state leading to fantasy and sexual behaviour such as masturbation) and the ability to reach orgasm and ejaculatory capacity may all remain intact in the presence of erectile dysfunction. It is important to determine the exact nature of the patient's problem by taking a detailed sex history in a sensitive manner. Recent dramatic advances in therapeutics have transformed public awareness of the problem and brought hope to many patients. The aim of this review is to outline the mechanisms of erectile function and dysfunction, and provide a synopsis of medical management. There are three types of erections: psychogenic, reflexogenic and nocturnal. Psychogenic erections result from visual and auditory stimuli or fantasy and are mediated by cerebral impulses passing through the thoracolumbar and sacral centres to the cavernous nerves. Reflexogenic erections are mediated by afferent impulses from sensory receptors of the skin of the shaft of the penis. Somatic pudendal nerves carry afferent impulses and efferents leave the sacral parasympathetic at the S2–S4 level. Sensory stimulation of the penis is an important component of a reflex arc that helps maintain erection during sexual activity. The mechanism of nocturnal erections occurring during REM sleep is unknown, but they are more sensitive to low androgen levels than psychogenic or reflexogenic erections. The local release of a large number of peptides and catecholamines ( 91; 23; 34; 77; 58) including endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( 2) and, recently, carbon monoxide ( 11) have been implicated in the erectile response. Detumescence is thought to be mediated by sympathetic nerve action associated with adrenaline release which is also responsible for orgasm and ejaculation. Sympathetic activation causes constriction of the trabecular smooth muscle and helicine arteries allowing blood pressure within the cavernosal sinuses of the penis to fall to near venous pressure and the penis to resume its flaccid state. The old classification of erectile dysfunction into organic and psychogenic causes is overly simplistic. The great majority of cases have components of each and, almost irrespective of the cause, management often entails counselling followed by a sequential therapeutic trial of a number of different treatment modalities ( Fig. 1). Erectile dysfunction is positively associated with depression, diabetes (28–59% of men attending diabetic clinics), cardiovascular disease, smoking, increasing age and indices of anger, and is negatively associated with dominant personality traits, dehydroepiandrosterone levels and HDL cholesterol ( 20; 32; 81). While inappropriate to accept erectile dysfunction as a 'natural' consequence of ageing ( 66), it is estimated that no less than 30–40% of men aged 40 years and over have experienced some degree of erectile dysfunction ( 88; 32). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction is high in prolactinoma (70%), adult castration (50–75%), alcoholism (47%), acromegaly (70%), chronic renal failure (46%) and other chronic illnesses. It is also increased by conditions that diminish sexual interest. Flow chart of erectile dysfunction management. Sexual interest is the psychological process underlying sexual desire and initiative that is induced by internal or external erotic stimuli. Loss of sexual desire, a reduction in the intensity and frequency of response to erotic stimuli, is characteristic of profoundly hypogonadal men and women irrespective of whether the problem is primary hypogonadism or secondary hypogonadism. The extent to which loss of sexual desire is responsible for the marked decline in sexual activity with age is not clear, but psychiatric and other intercurrent illnesses, psychological stress, anxiety, tiredness and familiarity or dissatisfaction with a relationship or stereotypic sexual act are frequently implicated ( 4; 55). Erectile dysfunction for many men means a loss of power and control. Information on all treatment options should be made available to the patient (± his partner), and he should be involved in decision-making so that the consultation process does not reaffirm his sense of powerlessness. The purpose of the consultation should be to facilitate potency at all levels. Anticipative and performance anxiety, monotony of sexual intercourse with the same partner, psychic and sexual traumas, impaired communication, female psychosexual dysfunction, the partner's negative reaction to failure and, possibly, high levels of female sexual interest ( 90), contribute to the development and persistence of erectile dysfunction irrespective of other causes. There is good evidence that psychological assessment of sexually dysfunctional patients and psychosexual counselling as an adjunct to physical therapies for erectile dysfunction are useful in selected patients in defined clinical settings ( 42; 100; 54). In some cases this may be just to give a man who is assailed by media pressure 'permission not to have intercourse'. Although intuition draws many to concur with the sentiment that 'the man behind the penis' should be taken into account so that inappropriate treatment does not turn 'a distressed man without an erection into a distressed man with an erection' ( 44), availability of such a service may be limited and the cost–effectiveness of psychosexual counselling in patients with erectile dysfunction of all causes remains to be clearly defined. There are insufficient data as yet to support the assertion that 'in the long run, psychosexual therapy is less expensive than taking sildenafil' ( 44). Serum testosterone levels have to fall to well below the lower end of the normal laboratory range (< 6.7 nmol/l − 2 ng/ml) before nocturnal penile tumescence is impaired ( 40), and sexual interest and the rigidity of erectile response to visual erotic stimuli in hypogonadal men has been shown to be little different to that seen in eugonadal controls ( 39; 49; 16; 15; 17). Several studies, however, suggest that testosterone replacement therapy in relatively modest deficiency states may improve erections in a minority of patients ( 15; 84; 39; 16; 17; 65). It is unclear whether the principle effects of hyperprolactinaemia on erectile dysfunction are mediated centrally by way of reduction in sexual interest and sex drive ( 17) or through a direct effect of prolactin on corpus cavernosum smooth muscle contractility, as appears to be the case in dogs ( 76). In either case, the mechanism is independent of circulating testosterone levels and gonadal axis function ( 85). When prolactin levels are greater than twice the upper limit of normal, treatment of hyperprolactinaemia of any cause with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine can be effective in restoring sexual desire ( 13). Loss of sex drive reduces concern about concurrent erectile dysfunction and as fewer than 1% of patients presenting with the primary complaint of erectile dysfunction have hyperprolactinaemia ( 52; 13), the cost–effectiveness of routine screening for this abnormality has been questioned ( 15). Nitric oxide is the principal mediator of erectile function ( 10). The release of nitric oxide from non-adrenergic–non-cholinergic nerves and endothelial cells of the cavernosal bodies activates guanylyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP induces relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum and increases blood flow to the penis ( 77). By inhibiting cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5, sildenafil reduces cGMP clearance and enhances (but does not initiate) the erectile response to erotic stimuli. Its efficacy depend on the integrity of local nerve supply as a source of nitric oxide. Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and in the fasting state reaches maximal plasma levels after 30–120 min. The drug has an absolute bioavailability of 40% and is cleared predominantly by hepatic metabolism, with pharmacokinetics virtually unchanged by renal function unless creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min. The maximum decrease in supine blood pressure in young, fit subjects within 4 h of an oral dose of sildenafil is approximately 10/7 mmHg and is not dose-related or associated with a change in pulse rate. Sildenafil inhibits type 6 phosphodiesterase isozyme in retinal photoreceptors with 10% of the efficacy of inhibition of type 5. Theoretical problems with visual function through inhibition of this key phototransduction cascade enzyme have not proved troublesome ( 96). Acuity and intra-ocular pressure are unaffected, loss in light sensitivity after a 100-mg dose is similar to the light-absorbing effect of an untinted car windscreen, and transient impairment of red/green colour discrimination requires sensitive tests to detect. The clearance of sildenafil is reduced by erythromycin and cimetidine, which increase circulating levels by 182% and 56%, respectively ( 3). Predictably, as the vasodilatatory effects of nitric oxide donors such as isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate and glyceryl trinitrate are markedly potentiated by sildenafil, co-administration is contraindicated. Patients with organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction are able to achieve satisfactory sexual intercourse in 60–70% of all attempts after oral sildenafil, compared to around 20% of those receiving placebo (Boolell et al., 1996; 38; 71; 26; 62). It is slightly less effective than intracorporeal alprostadil, but significantly less expensive and more practical. As neuronal nitric oxide release is necessary to initiate tumescence, the erectile dysfunction that results from non-nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy is not amenable to sildenafil ( 56; 102; 60). The efficacy of sildenafil in patients with spinal cord injury-induced erectile dysfunction who were able to achieve a partial erection in response to vibratory stimulation ( 24) and in those with prostatic irradiation-induced nerve damage is also quantitatively diminished ( 101), although the same proportion of patients show some response. In a double-blind study of 21 diabetic men aged 42–65 years, roughly half reported that sildenafil significantly increased the number of erections considered sufficiently hard for vaginal penetration ( 75). In a multi-centre, double-blind, flexible-dose study in which 268 diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction for a mean of 5.6 years were randomized to receive sildenafil or placebo, 61% of the 231 patients who completed the study reported at least one successful attempt at intercourse compared to 22% of controls ( 80). There is no increase in the incidence of serious cardiovascular events in diabetic ( 80) or non-diabetic men ( 64) receiving sildenafil. Post-marketing data from 6.4 million prescriptions issued to more than 3.5 million men validates the US Food and Drug Administration's legislative inactivity after receiving reports of 69 sildenafil-associated deaths. Of 130 deaths reported to date, 44 of which were within 5 h of taking a dose, 70% had at least one risk factor for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and three others were found to have severe coronary artery disease at autopsy. These figures do not exceed the death rate from heart disease in an age-matched population with a similar incidence of heart disease and diabetes ( 21; 47). Side-effects reported with a frequency of greater than 2% are rash, diarrhoea, dizziness, abnormal vision, urinary tract infection, nasal congestion, dyspepsia, flushing and headaches. Of these, headache, flushing and dyspepsia are the most common adverse events, but do not lead patients to discontinue treatment ( 38; 41; 64). No cases of priapism were reported in over 2500 patients age range 19–87 years receiving sildenafil in double-blind trials for up to 6 months or in over 2000 patients receiving sildenafil for up to 1 year ( 64). There is concern that concurrent use of sildenafil with nitrate donors may theoretically provoke catastrophic hypotension. The two groups at risk are patients with ischaemic heart disease who have an increased risk of erectile dysfunction and are likely to be prescribed nitrates, and recreational drug users. Approximately 3% of the latter believe that they have consumed sildenafil and used amyl nitrite concurrently ( 1), but experience suggests that up to 80% of black market tablets are counterfeit ( 86). There is insufficient data thus far to know whether the anxiety about this drug combination is well-founded and, if it is, the most appropriate action to take following inadvertent co-administration. The place of yohimbine in therapy for erectile dysfunction has been dismissed by the American Urological Association Clinical Guidelines Panel on Erectile Dysfunction ( 61). Randomized double-blind trials have produced conflicting results ( 63; 78; 92) but larger meta-analyses suggest that patients who received yohimbine obtain significant and useful improvements in symptoms ( 18; 30). Even if only marginally beneficial, yohimbine might still be useful considering its ease of administration and safety in patients who are unwilling to accept other treatments. Other drugs, such as the antidepressant trazodone ( 59; 22), apomorphine ( 43), alpha-adrenergic antagonists either alone ( 6) or to enhance the response of intracavernosal medication ( 103; 48), melanotan-II (a cyclic analogue of alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone) ( 28; 98) and dehydroepiandrosterone ( 79) (plasma levels of which were found to be inversely related to the incidence of erectile dysfunction in the Massachusetts Male Ageing Study: 32), have not been shown to be effective. Application of nitrate creams and combinations of nitrates with aminophylline and codergocrine mesylate to the penile shaft can induce tumescence but have not been shown to enhance the production of erections adequate for vaginal penetration ( 69; 67). Systemic side-effects such as hypotension and headaches are frequent, and contamination of the partner is a potential problem. Newer formulations such as topical PGE1 gel and mixtures of opiates, alpha-blockers and prostaglandins with absorption enhancers, drug carriers or the use of iontophoresis are currently under investigation and may prove safe and useful in the future. The rate and extent of absorption of prostaglandin E1 across the urethral mucosa when delivered as a pellet from a disposable, preloaded catheter (Medicated Urethral System for Erection (MUSE)) is variable. The time between application and erection can therefore differ considerably between patients, such that full erection after a test dose may occur in clinic, in the car park or when the patient reaches home over an hour later. Efficacy is lower than intracavernosal injection and oral sildenafil and side-effects such as urethral pain and discomfort, dizziness, sweating, hypotension and vaginal irritation have been reported ( 73; 74). Nevertheless, serious side-effects such as priapism are rare and, in some series, erections adequate for intercourse were obtained in 66% of applications ( 70; 99). Direct intracavernosal injections of vasoactive agents to treat erectile dysfunction was first described in 1982 using papaverine ( 95), a nitric oxide-independent vasodilator ( 58). Although very effective, papaverine is associated with a significant risk of side-effects such as prolonged erection and penile induration and calcification with long-term use ( 72). Other agents that have been used include alpha-blockers (phentolamine ( 9) and thymoxamine hydrochloride (Moxisylyte) ( 14; 46; 12), nitric oxide donors (linsidomine ( 93) and nitroprusside ( 57)) and peptides (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( 34; 25) and calcitonin-gene-related-peptide ( 19; 27)) either alone or in combination. Prostaglandin E1, the agent now most often used, combines reasonable efficacy with a relatively low risk of side-effects ( 50; 53; 73; 12). Overall, intracavernosal injection therapy consistently produces erections in 60–70% of patients in whom it is tried and in around 50% of diabetics ( 82). Despite the fact that intracavernosal treatment is very effective, many patients dislike self-injection and cannot be motivated to self-inject even if they respond to an injection given in clinic ( 36; 37). Although many claim that their sex lives have improved and 'would recommend the treatment to others' ( 45), of the 70% of responders who enter 'long-term therapy', the drop-out rate is at least 20–50% within the first year and may be as high as 80% in the longer term ( 97; 31; 51). This high drop-out rate probably relates more to fear of injections, local discomfort and lack of spontaneity than to systemic side-effects or the risk of priapism, fibrosis, haemosiderin deposition or haematoma formation, all of which are relatively unusual. Although external vacuum assist devices are able to produce an erection of comparable quality to that produced by intracorporeal injection in some men, overall satisfaction is lower, with a proportion of men achieving 'an erection-like state' but unable to enjoy satisfactory sexual intercourse. Many are disconcerted by either the pivoting nature of the erection or suffer side-effects such as bruising and pain at the site of the constricting rubber ring and penile ischaemia and coldness ( 5; 94; 35; 8; 89). The cost of the appliance for the user is a further disadvantage. In selected patients such as older men and particularly diabetics, in whom erectile dysfunction frequently results from a number of problems including impaired autonomic and endothelium-dependent mechanisms ( 7; 83; 82; 29), vacuum constriction devices potentially offer relatively effective treatment with low morbidity and few recognized complications ( 7; 33). Erectile dysfunction is a common and distressing medical condition that is now highly amenable to treatment almost irrespective of the cause. Safe, non-surgical treatments with unequivocal efficacy are psychological therapy, intracorporeal injection of vasoactive drugs, transurethral vasodilators and oral sildenafil, all of which have been reported to have a 50–70% overall response rate. Vacuum constriction devices are acceptable for some, usually older patients and oral yohimbine is thought to have marginal efficacy. Local creams to induce or enhance erectile function are currently being investigated. There is no place for androgen supplementation unless the patient is profoundly hypogonadal. Treatment of hyperprolactinaemia is very effective but is a rare cause of erectile dysfunction. As intercourse may entail an unfamiliar level of physical activity, it is sensible to ensure that the patient is able to climb a flight or two of stairs comfortably without provoking undue breathlessness or chest pain and to provide suitable advice about technique before commencing treatment. Once it is clear to the patients that erectile dysfunction can be satisfactorily overcome, the long-term use of treatments to do so tends to wane. Thus, although the prospect of effective treatment for what had been for many a distressing life sentence has the potential to place new demands on the health service, there is no evidence that restrictions on prescribing will prove economically rational.",

      "abstract": "Background In schizophrenia, patient reacts to sad news with cheerfulness or even laughter (Parathymia/Inappropriate affect). In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "It is known that mood disorders in women explicitly relates to estrogen production. Except for these findings phenomenon as Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, directly connected to menstrual cycle in women, is widely discussed. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a set of subjectively unpleasant mental and somatic symptoms. It appears in luteal phase of ovarian cycle. During menstruation it remits and disappears up to one week from its termination. DSM IV classified PMDD into the category of \"Other specific depressive disorders\" and further revision DSM IV-TR classifies PMDD as a separate strictly defined psychiatric diagnosis. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) does not include any specific category as PMDD or similar. The closest category F38.8 does not represent the core of the phenomenon because it relates only to general depressive symptomatology and does not give specific diagnostic criteria to menstrual cycle related mood disorders (Grady-Weliky, 2003). In the presented article, possible effectivity of PMDD treatment with the focus to antidepressants of SSRI type (Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors) is discussed. In spite of interesting and significant findings, the treatment of PMDD and accordingly PMS is above all multidisciplinary question and it must be treated like that.",

      "title": "Drug Trials in Status Epilepticus: Current Evidence and Future Concepts",
      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency with high morbidity and mortality. After many advances in the field, several unanswered questions remain for optimal treatment after the early stage of SE. This narrative review describes some of the important drug trials for SE treatment that have shaped the understanding of the treatment of SE. The authors also propose possible clinical trial designs for the later stages of SE that may allow assessment of currently available and new treatment options. Status epilepticus can be divided into four stages for treatment purposes: early, established, refractory, and superrefractory. Ongoing convulsive seizures for more than 5 minutes or nonconvulsive seizure activity for more than 10 to 30 minutes is considered early SE. Failure to control the seizure with first-line treatment (usually benzodiazepines) is defined as established SE. If SE continues despite treatment with an antiseizure medicine, it is considered refractory SE, which is usually treated with additional antiseizure medicines or intravenous anesthetic agents. Continued seizures for more than 24 hours despite use of intravenous anesthetic agents is termed superrefractory SE. Evidence-based treatment recommendations from high-quality clinical trials are available for only the early stages of SE. Among the challenges for designing a treatment trial for the later stages SE is the heterogeneity of semiology, etiology, age groups, and EEG correlates. In many instances, SE is nonconvulsive in later stages and diagnosis is possible only with EEG. EEG patterns can be challenging to interpret and only recently have consensus criteria for EEG diagnosis of SE emerged. Despite having these EEG criteria, interrater agreement in EEG interpretation can be challenging. Defining successful treatment can also be difficult. Finally, the ethics of randomizing treatment and possibly using a placebo in critically ill patients must also be considered. Despite these challenges, clinical trials can be designed that navigate these issues and provide useful answers for how best to treat SE at various stages.",

MUS is a working hypothesis based on the assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated but clinical condition presented by the patient was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS. The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels.

      "abstract": "An awakening has taken place over the last 25 years to the science of sleep disorders. Foremost amongst these, both in the medical world and the public eye, has been Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (SAS). The prevalence is thought to be the order of 1-2%. Males are eight times more commonly affected than females, although after the menopause the gap narrows considerably. Sleep apnoea occurs in children, usually in relation to large tonsils and adenoids, but in adult life patients usually present between the age of 40 and 60 and the prevalence increases with age. Numerous apnoeas or hypopnoeas during the night's sleep result in disordered sleep architecture and unrefreshing sleep. This is usually accompanied by night-long snoring which may lead to marital discord and even complaints from neighbours. Symptoms on waking may be a headache and a feeling of not being refreshed by sleep. Sleepiness during the day can interfere with work and social activities and may produce risks to the patient and others if it occurs while operating dangerous machinery or driving. Over a longer time scale SAS results in intellectual and memory deterioration, a higher incidence of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, polycythemia and pulmonary hypertension. Right heart failure is particularly likely if there is chronic airflow obstruction contributing to a low arterial oxygen level. Asystolic periods and tachyarrhythmias may occur during apnoeic periods. The increased mortality of SAS relates to coronary and cerebrovascular disease and arrhythmias. Sudden death occurs with greater frequency in patients with SAS, mainly at night.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome and Anxiety Disorders: A Psychobiological Link",
      "abstract": "The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been used for many years to describe disturbances of mood or physical symptoms occurring regularly 7–10 days before menses and remitting during menses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R) included PMS among the ‘proposed Diagnostic Categories Needing Further Study’ under the name of Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), and established among its diagnostic criteria the need for daily prospective symptoms self-ratings during at least two cycles, for confirmation [1]. The more recent fourth edition of DSM maintained PMS among the categories needing further study, adding the new category of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) [2]. PMDD is distinguished from PMS in several respects: It requires at least one mood symptom; the symptoms must be severe enough to cause functional impairment, and they must not be a mere exacerbation of another psychiatric disorder. Since no other diagnostic criteria have been proposed, many studies have compared the scores from the premenstrual and follicular phases: a 30–50% increase found in prospectively administered diaries is now normally accepted as an indicator of the diagnosis of PMS [3], no attention being paid to the quality of symptoms. On the other hand, no specific hormone changes or other biological markers are able to distinguish between PMS sufferers and normal women [4]. Therefore, the absence of both a universally accepted definition and an objective biological or clinical marker makes it impossible to study the etiology of PMS. Accordingly, the therapeutic approach is presently indefinite. Steinberg [5] correctly stated that the time-honored medical adage maintaining that ‘in the absence of cure, treatments multiply’ seems to be appropriate to PMS. Nevertheless, it is well accepted that the severe form of PMS, i.e. the one characterized by psychosocial impairment and thus requiring medical treatment, is present in 5–8% of women during their 40s. This implies that we should multiply our efforts toward the understanding of the disorder.",

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

A 64-year-old female was brought with complaints of memory disturbances and irritable behavior for 1 year. Onset was noted with giddiness and one episode with fall associated with loss of consciousness. She was managed conservatively for this. During the last 1 month, she developed agitation in the form of singing and dancing, at times noticed to be muttering to self with inadequate sleep. She would claim that she is as good as “Lata Mangeshkar” in singing. Hence, she was referred to our unit. Other symptoms were overtalkativeness, jocularity, and irritable mood. She would make inappropriate comments (about her increased sexual urges) in front of relatives and accuse the husband of infidelity. Comorbidities were diabetes mellitus and hypertension. No history of psychiatric illness in the patient (prior to this episode) or her first-degree family relatives was elicited. No history of convulsions/seizures was elicited. On mental status examination, she had increased psychomotor activity, appeared overfamiliar, and overdressed. She was distractible with pressure of speech. She had delusion of infidelity and delusion of grandiosity claiming to have superpowers and having the most melodious voice in all over India. She also claimed God, and various actors were speaking to her directly, inferred as auditory hallucinations. Her mood was elated and irritable, but her affect was stable. Her judgment was impaired. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Neurological evaluation was normal. Clinical testing for the frontal lobe showed impaired alternate hand sequence and a lack of concern, suggesting dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal area dysfunction. She performed well on clinical parietal lobe testing. Her mini-mental status score was 16 out of 30. Since the patient was inattentive, these findings are to be interpreted with caution. Neuropsychological evaluation and neurological intervention could not be done due to the patient's uncooperativeness. Computerized tomography of the brain showed scattered ischemic foci in the bilateral frontal periventricular and left posterior parietal subcortical white matter and bilateral posterior capsule-ganglionic white matter. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain also showed multiple small ischemic foci scattered in the bilateral subcortical and periventricular deep white matter in the frontoparietal regions and associated mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. She was started on tablet sodium valproate 200 mg BD in view of irritability and impulsivity. Tablet aripiprazole 2.5 mg per day was added in view of mood-congruent psychotic symptoms, behavioral problems, and safer cardiac profile.[3] On increasing to 5 mg over a week, improvement of almost 50% was reported with decreased irritability although the delusion of infidelity and delusion of grandiosity persisted but with lesser intensity. The patient tolerated valproate well, and levels were not estimated. Cerebral small vascular disease, of the gray and white matter, is a group of pathological process with myriad etiology.[4] Classical strokes such as hemiplegia may not be seen in lacunar and white matter lesions.[56] Although responsible for ischemic strokes in 25% of cases, the manifestations vary, such as the disorders of sensation, movement, sight, speech, balance, and coordination depending on the location of the lesion.[78] We diagnosed her as an organic mood disorder secondary to the small vessel disease. This was considered due to the temporal relationship of the disinhibition, talkativeness, grandiosity with long-standing history of hypertension, history of falls as probable presentation of the lacunar infarcts, absence of past or family history of mood disorder, consistent features of behavioral change due injury to the frontal lobe and impaired functioning on clinical testing, and radiological findings justifying the deficits. Late-onset mood disorder in the elderly is less reported and devoid of guidelines for its management.[9] A small vessel disease with such a presentation may be missed, as it may be devoid of a classical stroke-like presentation with neurological deficits. Further volume of data is necessary for understanding the relationship between such vascular lesions, consequential loss of function, and the ensuing presentations of mood episodes in the elderly.

Several findings from earlier smaller-scale studies were tested, and for the first time the potential differences between the hereditary and idiopathic phenotypes and between males and females were explored. Generally, the course of the pain manifests itself in three consecutive phases with an initial severe, continuous pain lasting for approximately 4 weeks on average. Sensory involvement was quite common and found in 78.4% of patients but was clinically less impairing than the initial pain and subsequent paresis. As a typically patchy disorder NA can affect almost any nerve in the brachial plexus, although damage in the upper and middle trunk distribution with involvement of the long thoracic and/or suprascapular nerve occurred most frequently (71.1%). We found no correlation between the distribution of motor and sensory symptoms. In INA recurrent attacks were found in 26.1% of the patients during an average 6 year follow-up. HNA patients had an earlier onset (28.4 versus 41.3 years), more attacks (mean 3.5 versus 1.5) and more frequent involvement of nerves outside the brachial plexus (55.8 versus 17.3%) than INA patients, and a more severe maximum paresis, with a subsequent poorer functional outcome. In males the initial pain tended to last longer than it did in females (45 versus 23 days). In females the middle or lower parts of the brachial plexus were involved more frequently (23.1 versus 10.5% in males), and their functional outcome was worse. Overall recovery was less favourable than usually assumed, with persisting pain and paresis in approximately two-thirds of the patients who were followed for 3 years or more.",

Severe MR has a probable or definitive causes in 80% of cases. 2/3 are prenatal, 1/6 perinatal and 1/6 postnatal. Metabolic disorders may manifest as MR and its progressive nature often is not observed at the time of evaluation. MR is a prominent finding of many hereditary metabolic diseases, but only a fraction of MR seen in daily practice is due to inborn errors of metabolism. Medical conditions may present as MR without major extraneurological changes. In the investigation of MR, developmental milestones of affected children as well as detailed physical and neurological exam looking for physical characteristics, and performance of routine and special screening tests should be done. The metabolic screening tests (urine and/or blood) is very helpful. Use of tandem MS or acylcarnitine profile in blood for the diagnosis of organic acidurias and aminoacidurias can be done in 3 minutes per blood sample, with more than 20 conditions simultaneously tested. Blood spots in filter paper, once dried, are stable for weeks and can be sent by regular air mail, with low processing costs. Its future as a mass screening tool seems promising.",

The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

      "title": "The evolution of early psychosis with variable expression. Study of a clinical case",
      "abstract": "It is the study of a clinical observation, over a period of two years, of a 21-year-old man who often presented himself at the emergency room for severe anxiety and behavioral disorders characterized by repeated self-mutilation, psychomotor agitation, homicidal behavior toward his father, aggressive impulsivity, and sometimes antisocial behavior (running away and dangerousness). Ideas of persecution and reference often underlay his disordered behaviors. The patient also made frequent suicide attempts related to brief depressive periods, in which he verbalized great suffering that he explained by family relational difficulties and traumatic events (parental abuse, accidents). After two years, the clinical picture was aggravated by the appearance of symptoms of schizophrenia comprising paranoid delusion, hallucinations with mental automatism, social withdrawal, and affective and behavioral disorganization that had completely replaced his self-aggressive acting-out. These polymorphic symptoms initially posed a diagnostic and therapeutic problem for psychiatrists due to their persistence and repetition; these were made more complex by the sexual and identity problems that were later revealed through psychotherapeutic observation.The observation consisted of attentive listening during regular psychotherapeutic interviews that allowed to retrace the evolution of this pathology and his stabilization. The goal was to construct a clinical and evolutionary perspective taking into account the progression of symptoms over time until the onset of psychosis. Despite us being limited by a neurobiological exploration that yielded no apparent results, the semiotic analysis of the patient’s symptoms, writings, and symbols allowed us to research the different precocious phases of the disease, as well as the psychopathological analysis of his symptoms.Results: This method allowed us to determine the first symptom, to identify the initial period of disorders and their relationships with vulnerability factors (parental trauma, genetics), to describe their evolution according to age, and to trace the symptoms of psychotic transition. Our aim was to emphasize the preventive role of early treatment of prepsychotic disorders. We consider the impact of anxiety on the patient's neuropsychic development and on the genetic origins of the disease.Conclusion: We emphasize the preventive approach, which consists in detecting the subjects at risk of psychotic transition and determining an appropriate psychotherapy to avoid any recurrence or aggravation of the disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: People with late-stage Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) who are assumed to have lost coherent cognitive capacity may exhibit unexpected episodes of spontaneous, meaningful, and relevant communication or behavior. Most reports of paradoxical lucidity or “episodes of lucidity” (EL) are anecdotal or case studies. Given the transient nature and lack of scientific explanation of the phenomenon, EL is under-investigated and poorly understood. To develop an operational definition of and typologies for EL, we conducted a pilot study of former and current family caregivers from UsAgainstAlzheimer’s A-LIST® (N = 480). Over sixty percent of caregivers (n = 294, 61%) reported witnessing at least one EL with their care recipient over the course of dementia. Most episodes happened in late stages of dementia (71%). Only 10% happened within 7 days before death. The majority of episodes (71%) lasted &lt;30 minutes. About half the episodes were characterized by uncharacteristic speech and communication. Caregivers perceived these experiences positively ( M = 4.1; range = 1–5), but also expressed desire to know why/when EL occurs and how to respond to it. We plan to use these data to refine definitions and typologies to incorporate into a prospective, demographically diverse survey to family caregivers to assess predictors of EL and linking EL to caregiver well-being and bereavement response. Precise and robust operationalizations of EL will allow future research to assess if EL has different effects on ADRD prognosis or alters how family members understand, manage and adapt to a PLWD’s dementia progression.",

Careful examination will reveal equally early symptoms in the emotional sphere. In a fair number of patients more dramatic syndromes develop. These always have certain characteristic features which permit their diagnosis as organic psychotic reactions implanted on the psychosis for which the patient is being treated; they disappear within one or two weeks after the last treatment.

In geriatric practice we observe first-time onset of depression in the elderly or a reoccurrence of depression that first appeared at an earlier age. During this age period the most different interrelationships between depressions and somatic pathology can be observed: Depressions can be concomitants of somatic pathology or pathogenetically connected with somatic diseases most often with pathology of nervous, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems and osteoarticular apparatus (somatogenic depressions). Psychogenic and medicamentous depressions can also exist [1-4]. Diagnosis of depressions in aged patients is more difficult than in young patients due to a high frequency of atypical manifestations of affective disorders, predominance of somatic complaints, and difficulties in",

An estimated 82% of men and 92% of women with moderate to severe OSA have not been diagnosed [3]. Sleep apnea events are defi ned as a complete cessation of breathing (apnea) or a marked reduction in airfl ow (hypopnea) during sleep, and are considered clinically relevant if they last more than 10 seconds. The episodes of apneas and hypopneas may persist for 30 to 60 seconds in some individuals. OSA is characterized by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway, often resulting in oxygen desaturation and arousals from sleep. The classic daytime manifestation is excessive sleepiness, and other symptoms such as non-refreshing sleep, poor concentration, and fatigue are commonly reported [4]. OSA is a serious condition that diminishes the quality of life [5] and is also associated with many common comorbidities. Studies have documented an increased incidence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, and gastroesophageal refl ux disease in OSA patients [6,7]. It is estimated that the average life span of an untreated OSA patient is 58 years, much shorter than the average life spans of 78 years for men and 83 years for women [8].

A variety of psychological, topical and oral therapies have been tried in this condition with varying degrees of success. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are known to cause delayed ejaculation but require daily administration, have a relatively slow onset of action and may cause SSRI discontinuation syndrome on withdrawal. In addition, they are currently unlicensed for PE. Dapoxetine hydrochloride, an SSRI, has been specifically developed for on-demand use in PE. Its pharmacokinetic profile is characterized by rapid absorption, a short initial half-life of 1.3-1.4 h and rapid elimination with minimal accumulation even after multiple dosing. Several large phase III studies have demonstrated that dapoxetine can increase intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and improve several patient-reported outcomes relevant to control of ejaculation and satisfaction with intercourse. Dapoxetine is generally well tolerated with a low incidence of discontinuations due to adverse events. There were no signals for treatment-emergent anxiety or SSRI discontinuation syndrome after abrupt withdrawal.",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Regular exercise causes chronic adaptations in anatomy/physiology that provide first-line defense for disease prevention/treatment ('exercise is medicine'). However, transient changes in function that occur following each exercise bout (acute effect) are also important to consider. For example, in contrast to chronic adaptations, the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity is predominantly rooted in a prolonged acute effect (PAE) that can last up to 72 h. Untrained individuals and individuals with lower insulin sensitivity benefit more from this effect and even trained individuals with high insulin sensitivity restore most of a detraining-induced loss following one session of resumed training. Consequently, exercise to combat insulin resistance that begins the pathological journey to cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) should be prescribed with precision to elicit a PAE on insulin sensitivity to serve as a first-line defense prior to pharmaceutical intervention or, when such intervention is necessary, a potential adjunct to it.

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the DSM-IV recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioral symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical and/or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric and/or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in close reciprocal relationship with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond the conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other nonantidepressant treatments, or the more extreme interventions that eliminate ovulation altogether, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option for this population. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that the SRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

While pregnancy is an immensesource of happiness and pleasure for a woman, it is also a stressful time. During pregnancy, there is a significantincrease in the level of steroidal hormones. Women become vulnerable to numerous mood disorders when thesechildbirth hormones are suddenly withdrawn. These mood disorders range in severity from mild postpartum blues tomore serious mood disorders such as postpartum depression and psychosis. Approximately 50% to 80% of newmothers experience postpartum blues within the first few days of their child's birth.Postpartum depression, while less prevalent (occurring in 10-15% of deliveries), has a profound impact on the healthof both the mother and the baby. Unfortunately, these forms of mental illnesses in women are usually undiagnosed,untreated, and underestimated. Postpartum psychosis is exceedingly rare, involving about 1-2 mothers out of every1000 live births, but it is a true psychiatric emergency.

      "title": "Tratamiento farmacológico de la incontinencia urinaria de esfuerzo",
      "abstract": "La incontinencia urinaria de esfuerzo (IUE) es la pérdida involuntaria de orina asociada a un esfuerzo físico que provoca un aumento de la presión abdominal (toser, reír, correr o incluso andar). Se estima que, en aproximadamente el 50% de las mujeres con incontinencia urinaria (IU), su síntoma principal es la IUE. La uretra en sí misma tiene un importante papel en el conjunto de los mecanismos de continencia, recibe inervación triple: simpática, parasimpática y somática. El estímulo somático llega a la uretra desde el núcleo de Onuf, situado en la médula sacra, a través del nervio pudendo, la estimulación de receptores nicotínicos, en el músculo estriado uretral provoca la contracción refleja y también la voluntaria del esfínter uretral. En estudios experimentales, se ha comprobado la implicación de la serotonina en el control central del aparato urinario inferior, aunque ha resultado difícil establecer el tipo de acción, la mayoría de estudios reconoce que la activación central dependiente de la serotonina produce una inhibición en los mecanismos sensoriales y la estimulación de la actividad somática motora del esfínter estriado uretral. Mediante técnicas inmunohistoquímicas, se ha podido observar que las neuronas del núcleo de Onuf que van al esfínter estriado uretral, están rodeadas de numerosos terminales adrenérgicos y serotoninérgicos y, por tanto, sensibles a los efectos de un inhibidor de la recaptación de serotonina (5-HT) y norepinefrina (NE). El incremento de serotonina y noradrenalina en la zona del núcleo de Onuf, provoca un aumento de actividad neural que trae como consecuencia un estímulo que favorece una contracción prolongada del esfínter uretral. Según esta observación, cualquier fármaco que actúe en el sistema nervioso central (SNC) y produzca un incremento en el aporte de serotonina y noradrenalina tiene un efecto que puede potenciar la continencia. La duloxetina es un inhibidor combinado de la recaptación de 5-HT y NE. Los ensayos clínicos realizados en un total de 1.913 mujeres con IU de predominio de esfuerzo, con duloxetina frente a placebo y el metaanálisis de éstos, proporcionan datos consistentes y de peso que apoyan la seguridad y la eficacia de la duloxetina para el tratamiento de la IUE. Esta forma de tratamiento se podrá ofrecer como primera opción terapéutica, al igual que la reeducación muscular del suelo pélvico a mujeres con diagnóstico de IUE. Los estudios de extensión y el uso del fármaco en la práctica clínica, indicarán el lugar exacto que ocupará el tratamiento farmacológico de la IUE en el contexto de la atención a la IU en la mujer. Urinary stress incontinence (USI) consists of involuntary urine loss associated with physical stress that increases abdominal pressure (coughing, laughing, running or even walking). In approximately 50% of women with urinary incontinence (UI), the main symptom is USI. In itself, the urethra plays an important role in the set of mechanisms of continence and receives innervation from 3 sources: sympathetic, parasympathetic and somatic. The somatic stimulus reaches the urethra from Onuf’s nucleus, situated in the ventral horn of the spinal cord at sacral 2 level, through the pudendal nerve, and stimulation of nicotinic receptors in the striated urethral muscle provokes reflex and voluntary contractions of the urethral sphincter. Experimental studies have demonstrated the involvement of serotonin in central control of the lower urinary apparatus. Although it has been difficult to establish the type of action, most studies recognize that central serotonin-dependent activation inhibits the sensory mechanisms and stimulation of somatic motor activity of striated urethral muscle. Immunohistochemical techniques have revealed that the neurons of Onuf’s nucleus that reach the striated urethral sphincter are surrounded by numerous adrenergic and serotoninergic terminals and are therefore sensitive to the effects of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitors. The increase of serotonin and noradrenalin in the area of Onuf’s nucleus increases neural activity, which leads to a stimulus favoring prolonged contraction of the urethral sphincter. According to this observation, any drug that, acting on the central nervous system, increases the contribution of serotonin and noradrenalin, could increase continence. Duloxetine is a combined 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor. Clinical trials of duloxetine versus placebo performed in 1913 women with UI, mainly USI, and meta-analysis of these drugs provide consistent and robust data supporting the safety and efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of USI. This form of treatment will be offered as the first-line therapeutic option along with pelvic floor reeducation in women with a diagnosis of USI. Studies of the drug in clinical practice will indicate its precise role in the pharmacological treatment of USI in the context of female UI.",

Ein immer groesserer Anteil von Unfallopfern beklagt psychische Beschwerden, wobei die Zunahme kein isoliertes Unfallphaenomen ist, sondern sich allgemein in der Bevoelkerung wiederfindet. Die Ursache, weshalb Unfallfolgen psychischer Art haeufig zu Rechtsstreitigkeiten fuehren, liegen darin, dass psychische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden und mitunter kaum zu objektivieren sind. Diese Ausgangslage erfordert zunaechst, dass zwischen einem seelischen Primaerschaden und einem seelischen Folgeschaden zu unterscheiden ist. Bei einem haftungsbegruendeten Primaerschaden muss die Gesundheitsbeeintraechtigung selbst Krankheitswert besitzen und dies fuer den Schaediger vorhersehbar sein. Bei psychisch bedingten Folgewirkungen erstreckt sich die Haftung demgegenueber grundsaetzlich auch auf die aus der primaeren Gesundheitsbeschaedigung resultierenden Folgeschaeden. Der Schaediger kann sich nicht auf eine seelische Labilitaet des Betroffenen berufen. Fuer nicht unmittelbar Beteiligte ist der Gesundheitsschaden dem Schaediger nicht zuzurechnen. Gesundheitsbeschaedigungen naher Angehoeriger koennen nur dann dem Schaediger zugerechnet werden, wenn die psychische Stoerung nach Art und Schwere deutlich ueber die Beeintraechtigungen hinausgeht, denen sie durch Todesnachrichten erfahrungsgemaess ausgesetzt sind. Bei der Schadenshoehe koennen besondere psychische Gegebenheiten im Rahmen des Schmerzensgeldes und beim Erwerbsschaden von Bedeutung sein. Der Sachverstaendige muss unabhaengig von der medizinischen Bezeichnung der geschilderten Symptome pruefen, ob eine Gesundheitsstoerung mit Krankheitswert vorliegt.

Le medecin generaliste d'unite a ici un role central dans la detection precoce de ces troubles.Notre travail a consiste, a l'aide d?une revue de la litterature sur le sujet, a etudier 30 dossiers psychiatriques de jeunes militaires ayant fait une decompensation psychotique ainsi que la lettre des medecins generalistes d'unite qui les ont adresses afin de degager des indices d'alerte d?un risque accru de decompensation d'une psychose. La phase psychotique est precedee par une phase prodromique qui peut durer plusieurs annees et quiest caracterisee principalement par des troubles du comportement et des signes nevrotiques qui sont les indices les plus souvent detectes par les medecins generalistes. Les elements psychotiques traduisent l'entree dans la phase active de la maladie. Les medecins d?unite rapportent principalement des idees delirantes de persecution et des troubles du cours de la pensee et de la logique. Cependant, leselements premorbides comme les antecedents psychiatriques, les troubles de la personnalite et la saison de naissance ne sont pas assez recherches par les generalistes alors qu'ils sont des indices importants. On retrouve egalement des facteurs associes primordiaux comme la consommation de cannabis ou des antecedents de traumatisme crânien. Le principal probleme pose par ces indices estcelui de leur non-specificite et qu'ils n?ont pas de valeur predictive.

      "title": "M6. REDUCED READINESS POTENTIAL AS A NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE OF SELF-DISTURBANCES IN EARLY–COURSE PSYCHOSIS: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A HIGH–DENSITY EEG STUDY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Self-disturbances reflect a core dimension of Schizophrenia that can be identified before disease onset and might underlie the development of typical psychotic symptoms. The Sense of Agency (SoA) can be conceptualized as the pre-reflective sensation of being the one who is causing or generating an action or thought. Passivity phenomena, such as the reported feeling and belief that one’s thoughts or actions are generated and/or controlled by an external agent, are exquisite examples of SoA disturbances observed in Schizophrenia. Despite intensive research, the neurobiological pathogenetic mechanisms underlying such disturbances remain unclear. Among several putative neurophysiological brain abnormalities, a reduction of the Bereitschaftspotential, also called pre-motor or Readiness Potential (RP), was described in chronic, medicated patients with Schizophrenia. Given its anticipation of voluntary movement by 1 – 2 seconds over the motor cortex and supplementary motor area contralateral to the effector, RP has previously been proposed to be a neural signature of volition to initiate movement. Interestingly, higher RPs among healthy subjects have been recently associated with stronger intentional binding, suggesting increased SoA in subjects exhibiting stronger premovement activity. The objective of our work was to study RP abnormalities in patients with a psychotic illness of recent onset and to relate them to self disturbances, in order to clarify the relationship between known neurophysiological and psychopathological abnormalities. Methods We employed high-density electroencephalography (64-channel BrainAmp, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) to record scalp potentials during a self-paced movement task in a group of seven early–course psychosis patients (mean age = 24,5, range 20–33) and an equal group of age– and gender– matched (mean age =25,3, range 19 – 36) healthy control subjects. Patients were recruited during an acute stage of their disorder requiring hospitalization and were treated with low–dose atypical antipsychotics. Exclusion criteria included major medical or neurological illness affecting the CNS and any intellectual developmental disorder. Several parameters related to the elicited RP were recorded, including maximum amplitude and slope. The Examination of Anomalous Self Experience (EASE) scale was chosen to assess Self disturbances in the patient group by an experienced clinician who was blind to the neurophysiological outcome. Results RP was found to be reduced in patients, compared to healthy control subjects, in both its amplitude and slope (p &amp;lt; 0,005) despite comparable EMG activity. EASE scores of items ‘EASE-10’ (a comprehensive item that reflect most prototypically the disorders of self-experience) and ‘EASE-2’ (“Self-Awareness”) appeared to increase monotonically with the decrease of RP slope (p &amp;lt; 0,05). Discussion Our preliminary data show that disturbances of RP are present since the early course of psychotic disorders. They also suggest that such abnormalities may reflect the severity of self-disturbances in these patients. If confirmed in a larger, medication-naïve samples, our findings might clarify the underlying neural mechanisms of such abnormalities and provide a solid basis for further investigation of RP disturbances as an early biological marker for Schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",

      "abstract": "210 patients with acute psychotic disorder in a state of alcohol withdrawal were examined. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

In these individuals the ego becomes befuddled and as a result the libidinal drive is blocked. The result of this is destruction. The manner in which this destruction is carried out depends upon whether someone has wronged the individual or he has wronged himself. When it is the latter the act is generally carried out more or less quietly, whereas when it is the former it is carried out more dramatically and openly.

      "abstract": "Introdução: O Transtorno de Pânico é uma condição psiquiátrica debilitante caracterizada por episódios recorrentes e inesperados de medo intenso, conhecidos como ataques de pânico. Esses ataques são frequentemente acompanhados por sintomas físicos. A etiologia é multifacetada e complexa, envolvendo uma combinação de fatores genéticos, biológicos, psicológicos e ambientais. A prevalência estimada ao longo da vida é de 2%-3% da população geral. O presente artigo tem por objetivo revisar a literatura sobre os sintomas cardiorrespiratórios associados ao Transtorno de Pânico. Materiais, sujeitos e métodos: Para a elaboração deste artigo, foram consultados artigos científicos e artigos de revisão publicados e referenciados na BVS, SciELO e Medline/PubMED entre 2014 e 2024. Resultados e discussão: Os sintomas físicos mais comuns no Transtorno de Pânico são os cardiorrespiratórios, como taquicardia, dispneia, sudorese, tremores e sensação de asfixia. Os ataques geralmente atingem o pico em minutos e podem durar de minutos a uma hora, deixando o indivíduo exausto e apreensivo em relação a futuros ataques. O tratamento é através de uma abordagem multimodal que engloba psicoterapia e farmacoterapia. Considerações finais: Os sintomas do Transtorno de Pânico são variados e podem ser extremamente debilitantes para os pacientes no aspecto físico e mental. A compreensão dos sintomas é essencial para um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento eficaz. A abordagem terapêutica deve incluir terapia cognitivo-comportamental, medicamentos e técnicas de relaxamento com o intuito de ajudar os pacientes a gerenciar seus sintomas e recuperar uma vida plena e funcional.",

According to the World Health Organization, at least one episode of headache during a lifetime has occurred in almost every inhabitant of the Earth, and about half of them noted periodic headaches. In its etiology, cephalalgia can be primary, not associated with organic damage to tissues and organs, and secondary, which is based on pathological changes. In particular, cephalalgia in inflammatory lesions of the paranasal sinuses, brain tumors, encephalitis and meningitis, acute cerebrovascular accident, head trauma, arterial hypertension, aneurysm of the cerebral vessels, etc., should be attributed to the secondary headache. In 95–97 % of cases, the headache is not based on organic lesion, and in this case, the headache is primary. Primary cephalalgia can be based on both vegetative-vascular and metabolic-destructive changes. Primary headache can be noted with emotional or physical overstrain, exposure to a number of light, sound or olfactory stimuli, liquorodynamic or dysmetabolic disorders, when taking certain medications. Conventionally, primary headache can be divided into three groups — tension headache, migraine and cluster headache.",

En más del 50% de los casos las lesiones se presentan en cabeza, cara y cuello. Es por eso que el odontólogo y especialmente el odontopediatra deben estar preparados para reconocer alguna forma de maltrato o negligencia con base en una historia clínica adecuada y una exploración intencionada ante la sospecha de síndrome de niño maltratado. Objetivo: Conocer los indicadores intraorales y extraorales que le permitan al odontopediatra reconocer los signos y contribuir en el diagnóstico como parte de un equipo multidisciplinario encargado de la atención de estos pacientes. Caso clínico: Paciente masculino de dos años cinco meses quien acude al Servicio de Urgencias del Instituto Nacional de Pediatría por presentar edema periorbitario, múltiples fracturas en extremidades e indicadores orofaciales que permitieron diagnosticar síndrome de niño maltratado. Conclusión: Considerando la frecuencia con que las estructuras orofaciales se ven involucradas en el síndrome de niño maltratado, existe un compromiso médico, ético y legal para que todos los dentistas y específicamente los odontopediatras intervengan en la prevención, detección, diagnóstico y tratamiento de este problema médico social.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The pathogenesis of delayed ejaculation (DE) is rather unknown, though the contribution of various psychological, marital, hormonal, and neurological factors has been advocated. In this study we systematically investigated the relative relevance of the aforementioned factors in 1632 men who were seeking medical help for sexual dysfunction. The severity of DE was classified according to Kaplan criteria. Mild and moderate forms of DE (MMDE) recognized different risk factors than the most severe ones (anejaculation or severe DE [ASDE]). ASDE was essentially coupled with the presence of neurological diseases or with the use of serotoninergic drugs. Serotoninergic drugs also significantly increase (by at least 10‐fold) the risk for MMDE, which, however, was also coupled with other relational factors (eg, partner's impaired climax, patient's hypoactive sexual desire [HSD]) or intrapsychic factors (eg, stress at work). At multiple regression analysis, some organic pathological conditions (such as psychiatric disorders and hypogonadism) were also associated with MMDE. In particular, hypogonadism retained significance for DE even after adjustment for HSD (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08 [1.11–3.89]; P &lt; .05), suggesting other effects of testosterone deficiency on the ejaculatory reflex besides reduced libido. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that multiple psychobiological determinants are associated with DE, a still obscure condition that substantially impairs psychosexual equilibrium of the couple.",

ClassificationLow back pain can be acute, sub-acute or long-term; acute-on-chronic, with recurrence rearing its head among a significant minority.Acute low back pain is usually defined as the duration of an episode of low back pain persisting for less than 6 weeks; sub-acute as LBP which lasts between 6 and 12 weeks and long-term LBP as persisting for 12 weeks or more; chronic LBP is defined as LBP persisting for 12 weeks or more.Recurrent low back pain is defined as a new episode after a symptom-free period of 6 months, but not an exacerbation of chronic low back pain (van Tulder et al, 2004).Walker, 2000 estimated that 70-95% of any adult population will suffer at least one episode of back pain in its lifetime, while Truchon, 2001 proposed 60-80%.Fifty per cent of such cases will recur within 3 months (Lawrence et al, 2006).Recurrent and chronic LBP accounts for more than 70% of cases reported at clinics.Acute LBP is a common presentation of back pain and it is usually self-limiting; lasting less than 3 months and may not need any medical intervention.About half of those individuals who experience acute LBP will have recurrences within the first year of the first episode, leading to a possible history of chronic low back pain (Moffroid, 1997).Waddell and Bry-Jones (1994) submitted that LBP not settled within 8-12 weeks is likely to result in chronic disabling pain.Acute LBP tends towards becoming a complex chronic pain disorder, involving anatomical, physiological, psychological and social aspects (Roach et al, 1997).Chronic/recurrent LBP is a chief source of incapacitation, suffering and expense frequently resulting in significant worry and interference with daily activities leading to significant level of disability.It is a tremendous burden on patients and health service providers.It usually results from acute pain of muscular or connective tissue origin, which persists in approximately 30% of cases in adults and 20% of cases in adolescents.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

Alongside with deficient disorders PMD are the main characteristics of post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness. PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

Leitsymptome des psychiatrischen Notfalls sind Störungen des Bewusstseins, des Antriebs und der Stimmung. Ein psychiatrischer Notfall erfordert zum Ausschluss einer exogenen Ursache oder organischer Erkrankung neben der Erhebung eines differenzierten psychopathologischen Befundes obligatorisch eine körperliche Untersuchung und den Einsatz apparativer Untersuchungen. Psychiatrische Notfälle sind nach internistischen Notfällen die zweit- bis dritthäufigste Einsatzursache für einen Notarzt. Psychiatrische Störungen werden in Notaufnahmen nur zum geringen Teil erkannt und angemessen versorgt. Selbst bei gesicherter Suchtmitteleinnahme sollte nach weiteren Ursachen für die Symptomatik und nach begleitenden Verletzungen gesucht werden, damit Differenzialdiagnosen nicht übersehen werden. Für Erregungszustände und sich ankündigende Aggressivität gibt es charakteristische Prodromalsymptome. Sie können jedoch auch unvermutet und völlig unverhältnismäßig auftreten (Raptus). Über 10 % der Ärzte erleiden im Laufe ihres Berufslebens Verletzungen als Folge von Aggressivität durch Patienten. Bei Lebensbedrohung, blindwütigem Rasen oder im Erregungssturm ist das entschiedene, unmissverständliche und koordinierte Vorgehen von medizinischem Personal, Ordnungs- und Rettungskräften zur Verhinderung von Personenschäden aus zahlenmäßig hoher Überlegenheit unumgänglich.

Physical and mental reactions to such events are normal and are part of the process of recovering from the stress of loss or a critical incident. The following is a list of normal reactions to a traumatic event: PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIONS TO A CRISIS 25 In addition, a period of mild to moderate depression is sometimes experienced following exposure to a stressful event or tragic loss (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998). Symptoms of depression include the following: These are normal reactions and are part of the process of recovering from a loss or critical incident stress. Although there is little anyone can do to take away these uncomfortable feelings, there are several things individuals who have experienced a crisis or stress situation can do to speed up the recovery process (Jobes &amp; Berman, 1996; Roberts, Yeager, &amp; Streiner, 2004; Weishaar, 2004):",

This delay leads to broad psychosocial problems and/or a vulnerable position in society. This study maps the experiences of adults (18 to 65 years) with regard to the diagnosis of a developmental disorder or an acquired brain injury in Flanders (Belgium): 26 adults with one or more recent diagnoses of autism, ADHD, intellectual disability or neuropsychological symptoms after an acquired brain injury were interviewed. Common experiences were searched through an interpretative phenomenological analysis using the software program Nvivo™. The challenges of symptoms prior to receiving a diagnosis are often great. Adults have been looking for answers for a long time. The accessibility of diagnostic services in Flanders is experienced as limited. Primary and secondary care providers play a crucial role in timely referral, but participants experience a shortage of knowledge and expertise among them. For many participants, receiving a diagnosis is the first step in accepting further treatment, although they report a substantial need for a more seamless transition from diagnosis to guidance and advice.",

      "title": "POST–SPINAL CORD INJURY PAIN STATES",
      "abstract": "Pain, in contrast to motor deficit, is rarely the main cause of functional disability in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). It frequently occurs, however, in conjunction with disabling motor, autonomic, and urinary tract problems. It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 patients in the United States with SCI. 38 It is probable that more than a half of all SCI patients suffer from pain. 6 These numbers reflect the overall magnitude of this problem. The severity and persistence of pain associated with SCI are, however, of greater significance than its prevalence. It is not unusual for these patients to experience pain for decades because their longevity approaches normal life expectancy owing to early interventions and rehabilitative measures. 40 The lack of effective treatment for SCI pain causes these patients great frustration because in addition to long-term motor disability, they must endure intractable pain. This article first discusses acute pains resulting from spinal injury (Table 1). The remainder of the article concentrates on chronic pains that either appear immediately or sometime after SCI and continue for more than 6 months. It is important to recognize that after 3 to 6 months, the condition of the patient's spinal cord stabilizes, and neurologic dysfunction is no longer considered chronic but rather is referred to as a permanent post-SCI neurologic condition. Pain can appear at any time after SCI (i.e., in the acute stage, during recovery, or in the stable phase). In addition, some pain syndromes are found to be related to complications of SCI. The term pain is used generically throughout the article, although it sometimes may denote more than one type of pain. Referrals to pain generally include dysesthesia because it is difficult to distinguish between these conditions before considering a detailed description of the patient's complaint, including its distribution as well as neurologic findings. 7 Nociceptive versus neurogenic pain (see the articles by Sorkin, and Yaksh and Chaplan) is presented followed by a discussion regarding central pain syndrome, which is treated separately for the purpose of this article. Cauda equina injury is a pure root/nerve injury and does not include primary spinal cord lesion. It is, however, common to include cauda equina injury in discussion of SCI pain. 15, 22, 54 This article also includes discussion about cauda equina injury for several reasons: It is caused by spinal column injury, it may occur concomitantly with conus medullaris injury, and its associated pain is similar to so-called transitional zone SCI pain.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

      "title": "Depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant women: A community-based study",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pregnancy is supposed to be a time of emotional well-being in a woman's life, but for many women, this is a time of confusion, fear, sadness, anxiety, stress, and even depression. Mental health, in spite of being an important component of reproductive health, is often neglected. Moreover, in the absence of systematic screening, most antenatal mental disorders are not detected. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, between 14% and 23% of women will struggle with some symptoms of depression during pregnancy.[1] Depression in pregnancy may diminish one's capacity for self-care, precipitating inadequate nutrition, drug or alcohol abuse, and poor antenatal clinic attendance, all of which may compromise a woman's physical and mental health, may reduce optimal fetal monitoring, and might restrict the growth and development of the fetus. Performing antenatal screening is justified and seems reasonable since most postnatal depressive disorders begin during or before pregnancy. Anxiety during pregnancy has been found to be associated with depression as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Various studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal stress and cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problem in a child. An in-depth community-based query has to be made during the antenatal period as most of the past studies have been hospital-based and postnatal centric. The importance of mental health in pregnancy can be emphasized by the fact that even the best obstetric care cannot give a desirable outcome of the pregnancy if the mental health issues of the expectant mother are not addressed at the right time and in the right manner. To generate local evidence to fill up the knowledge gap about the mental health problems faced by the antenatal females and to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in antenatal females, a cross-sectional community-based descriptive enquiry was conducted from January to October 2014 in Ghazipur, an urbanized village in East Delhi which is the field practice area of our institute. One hundred and sixty-five antenatal women who gave consent to participate in the study and residing in the area for 6 months or more were included in the study. The study participants who needed immediate medical attention and/or participant with chronic mental illness were not included in the study. The tool used for the study included the depression, anxiety, stress scale. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 25.5%, 63%, and 23%, respectively. Figure 1 shows the distribution of depression, anxiety, and stress based on severity.Figure 1: Severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among pregnant females (n = 165)The increased vulnerability for mental illness in pregnancy can be explained by the \"Biopsychosocial Model,\"[2] which integrates the biological, psychological, and social factors to explain the occurrence of mental illness. Pregnant females have increased biological vulnerability due to the hormonal maladjustment, psychological vulnerability due to apprehension for new life of motherhood, and social vulnerability due to the added demands of family support and care during this critical phase of her life. More community-based studies need to be done to increase the database of similar bigger epidemiological studies to be conducted in different social and cultural settings in India. Our study provided a quantitative descriptive enquiry, but some sensitive issues can be picked up only by qualitative study such as in-depth interviews or focus group discussion. There is now a need to move toward quality comprehensive antenatal services. The findings of our study indicate the need to incorporate mental health components in RCH (Reproductive & Child health) program. At the present junction, universal screening may not be a suitable strategy, but surely, it is a desirable and achievable goal in the future. Longitudinal prospective research is needed to establish the temporality of the onset of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnancy. A control group of nonpregnant women with a similar sociodemographic profile may be a good estimate of the actual burden of mental health morbidities in pregnancy. Repeated probing on several occasions can build up the rapport and gain the confidence of the victim, so antenatal care visits are an ideal option as there are multiple chances of contact with the healthcare delivery system. Our study provided scoping bit in the base of these hitherto less explored and less examined and underappreciated issues related to pregnancies, on which further studies can be planned on a larger constructive framework and better-resourced methodologies.

      "title": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder: A controversial new diagnosis",
      "abstract": "On January 1st, 2022, the controversial diagnosis premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) was added to the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11).1 PMDD is placed under gynecological diseases and can be seen as a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMS is not a recognized diagnosis but is incorporated in the popular language. The loosely defined premenstrual tension syndrome has also been introduced as an exclusion diagnosis to PMDD. To make a diagnosis of PMDD, the symptoms must occur during the luteal phase in most cycles within the past year and must include an affective symptom (eg irritability or depressed mood) and a somatic/cognitive symptom (eg lethargy, joint pain, concentration difficulties). Furthermore, the condition must cause \"significant distress\". PMDD affects up to 6% of women of reproductive age.2 The overlap between symptoms of PMDD and mental disorders such as bipolar disease and depression may present a diagnostic challenge for healthcare professionals. The introduction of PMDD into the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) in 2013 has been controversial. On the one hand the addition was strongly advocated by patients, psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry, on the other hand it was criticized by psychologists and generalists, fearing over diagnosis and pathologization of normal hormonal changes. Among the opponents were feminist scholars who saw the PMDD label as a way of silencing women and as an inappropriate categorization of aspects of ordinary life as a mental disorder. Some argued that a diagnosis of PMDD might be used against women and serve to mask the actual reasons for a woman's rightful anger and distress. The addition of the PMDD diagnosis was further criticized for being pushed by the pharmaceutical companies. Indeed, a pharmaceutical company funded and participated in a consensus meeting on the definition of PMDD.3 This allegedly helped convince the FDA of the diagnostic validity of PMDD and consequently led to the approval of antidepressants for the treatment of the disorder, thereby opening a million-dollar market.3 To make the drug more attractive for women it was repainted in lavender and pink, and the trade name was changed from Prozac to Sarafem. As part of the marketing process, the company created awareness campaigns for the condition, using the slogan \"Think it's PMS? It could be PMDD3\" a campaign which was later criticized by the FDA for trivializing the condition. Most of these controversies may still apply to the current introduction of PMDD into ICD-11, although the condition is not placed under mental disorders. It can still be argued that women suffering from real injustices and facing problems with their position in the society or in the family could \"just get a pill\" instead of being taken seriously.4 Thus, studies showing a correlation between PMDD and abuse and mistreatment at work have been used to argue the case that real problems were the cause of the cyclical symptoms. The introduction of PMDD has been compared to the introduction of the term \"hysteria\" that was placed on women in the 19th and 20th century who wanted equal rights. PMDD is, by some, still seen as a social construct – a notion which is supported by the different PMDD prevalence estimates in different countries.4 Advocates of PMDD argue that the condition exists because there are women who meet the criteria for the disorder and there is a marked clinical benefit of treatment with hormonal contraception and antidepressants. Furthermore, neurobiological studies have shown a pathological response to hormone fluctuations in women with PMDD.5 The biological explanation is backed up by newer studies showing that sex-hormone fluctuations may provoke depressive episodes.6 Opponents argue that little is known about the condition, and that most of the knowledge of PMDD is an extrapolation from studies on PMS. Advocates of PMDD further state that by acknowledging the condition more research could be done.3 We recognize the fact that agreement on definitions is important for research, but it should be kept in mind that labelling a woman with a diagnosis may have considerable social and juridical implications. There is still concern that PMDD is not accurately defined and that the distinction between PMS and depression is blurred. To ensure correct diagnosis, prospective registration of symptoms in a diary is recommended. In 2003, the European Medicines Agency rejected PMDD as an indication for treatment with antidepressants after reviewing the evidence even though a few member countries had approved the indication. The major argument was that PMDD was not a recognized diagnosis in the ICD. With the addition of PMDD into ICD-11, an approval of antidepressants for the treatment of PMDD in Europe may follow. The next step may be advertisements and awareness campaigns as seen in the USA. There is always a risk of erroneously diagnosing a patient with the wrong condition. In the case of PMDD misdiagnosing a woman carries the risk of initiating an unnecessary use of antidepressants that have many adverse effects, such as sexual dysfunction, and may be addictive. We recognize that PMDD may have a serious impact on a woman's quality of life. As clinicians we are familiar with the stories of women who have felt misunderstood for years, describing that their symptoms have been neglected as usual hormonal changes. These women have a need for formal recognition of the - often debilitating - condition. For many of them it is a relief to finally be taken seriously and receive a diagnosis.7 However, receiving a diagnosis can also – in some cases – be unhelpful.8 We must find a proper balance between acknowledging and caring for the sick and at the same time protecting the healthy from overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The introduction of PMDD into ICD-11 may have implications for marketing from pharmaceutical companies, public opinion regarding the condition and activities in patient organizations. To avoid overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, it is important that gynecologists (and other physicians) focus on the principle of \"primum non nocere\" and strictly adhere to ICD-11 definitions while making a diagnosis of PMDD.",

A apresentação deste caso clínico justifica-se pela incidência crescente deste diagnóstico e pela importância do reconhecimento atempado de fatores causais reversíveis para o mesmo, que permita a realização de tratamento dirigido e a minimização de complicações. Descrição do Caso: Homem de 70 anos, solteiro, ex-fumador, com antecedentes de alcoolismo e de comportamentos sexuais de risco. É trazido pela filha à consulta por um quadro com quatro anos de evolução de alteração comportamental, com episódios de heteroagressividade, discurso incoerente, perda progressiva de autonomia e autonegligência e descoordenação motora associada a alterações da marcha com quedas frequentes. Destaca-se a deteção, duas semanas antes da data da consulta, de lesão cutânea escrotal com 4x2cm de diâmetro e 2cm de espessura, de consistência elástica, indolor, ulcerada, compatível com goma sifilítica. Por suspeita de sífilis terciária é encaminhado para o serviço de urgência (SU), com posterior internamento e confirmação de neurossífilis, tendo cumprido terapêutica prolongada com penicilina endovenosa (EV), com melhoria do quadro neurológico. Três meses depois é reinternado por reativação de neurossífilis e medicado com penicilina, seguindo-se, após alta, um agravamento do seu estado clínico, com caquexia, diminuição global da força muscular mais evidente ao nível dos membros inferiores, disartria marcada e disfagia progressiva. Faleceu 11 meses depois, por pneumonia associada aos cuidados de saúde. Comentário: Neste caso clínico destaca-se a presença de uma causa potencialmente reversível de demência: neurossífilis. Após tratamento verificou-se uma melhoria parcial do quadro; contudo, sem completa recuperação e com posterior deterioração progressiva. Este aspeto justifica-se pelo diagnóstico tardio e pela presença concomitante de outros fatores etiológicos para a síndroma demencial. Pelo conhecimento dos antecedentes pessoais, do contexto sociofamiliar e do estado prévio do seu doente, o médico de família encontra-se numa posição privilegiada para o diagnóstico precoce e orientação destas situações.",

      "abstract": "Suicide is a significant public health issue and a major cause of death in Korea. Almost 95% of all persons who commit or attempt suicide have a diagnosed mental disorder. Depressive disorders account for 80% of this figure; schizophrenia accounts for 10%. Stress has an impact on the onset and course of psychiatric disorders. The stress response is monitored by measuring the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Numerous studies have identified changes in HPA axis activity and glucocorticoid action in psychiatric disorders. Various stressful life experiences (prenatal stress, adverse early life experiences, ongoing or recent psychosocial stress) are important environmental factors enhancing the sensitivity of some individuals to stress in adulthood. In this review, we introduce the association between stress and psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "ADHD covers a group of common, chronic neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by developmentally abnormal and disabling levels of restlessness and overactivity (usually combined with impulsiveness) and/or inattention. There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive; predominantly hyperactive-impulsive; and combined type. For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. At the age of 25, half will still have symptoms which continue to cause significant impairment. ADHD is associated with an increased rate of other disorders: mood disorders; anxiety; other behavioural disorders; autism spectrum disorders; tic disorders; specific learning difficulties; developmental co-ordination disorder and sleep disorders. The GP has an important role in identification of possible ADHD, and onward referral, and also in the management of ADHD post-diagnosis, particularly with respect to prescribing medication usually on a shared care basis with specialist services.",

      "abstract": "Relapse can be defined as \"the return of a disease after partial recovery\". This definition is directly applicable to schizophrenic disorder. Relapse in this condition can be evaluated at the symptomatic, phenomenological and behavioural levels. Relapse impinges on inter-personal, social and occupational spheres of the patient's activity. In turn, relapse has wider implications for the family in general, for the provision of medical and social facilities and for health economics. There are no generally accepted criteria for relapse but outcomes such as violence or suicide, extreme psychotic behaviour and rehospitalization have been used. Less obvious criteria include major and minor symptom worsening and prodromata. Relapse is a relative term and must take into account the following factors: the patient's condition before the original onset of illness; his level of functioning before the present episode; the severity of the relapse in terms of symptom severity, duration and interference with personal functioning; the appearance of any new symptoms or behaviour patterns; the type of treatment given prior to relapse, and hence relatively ineffective; the type of treatment given during relapse, and its efficacy. Relapses often follow a pattern which may be fairly specific to each individual patient. Social factors may have predictive power but these need validation in different samples.",

      "title": "Delirium During Emergence From Anesthesia: A Case Study",
      "abstract": "Emergence is defined as the transition from the sleep state to full consciousness. Emergence from general anesthesia usually is a smooth and uneventful transition through the 4 stages of anesthesia (Table 1). Although uncommon (<10% of surgical cases), delirium may arise during emergence from anesthesia.1 Critical care nurses working in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) should be aware that emergence delirium may occur after all types of anesthetic techniques. The focus of this article is delirium after anesthesia.2 The case study deals specifically with the unusual behavior of a patient who received intravenous sedatives, not a general anesthetic, for plastic surgery.Emergence delirium occurs most often in elderly patients and patients with psychiatric conditions such as depression or drug dependency. It may be associated with clinical conditions such as organic brain disease or with the medications used to treat the underlying conditions. Emergence delirium may occur in as many as 10% to 15% of elderly patients.3,4 Emergence delirium also occurs in children and patients who are anxious about surgical findings and outcomes.1,5 Patients who express marked fear of disfigurement or of a possible diagnosis of cancer preoperatively may have signs and symptoms associated with unusual emergence from anesthesia.1,5Emergence delirium after anesthesia can be caused by a variety of physiological and pharmacological factors.1,5 Before any intervention is started to manage emergence delirium, physiological causes must be investigated. Arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia are potential causes of delirium or agitation after anesthesia. If sedating agents are given, respiratory depression may become severe to the point of apnea. If a patient's vital signs are stable and his or her oxygen saturation is normal, other physiological factors associated with untoward emergence from anesthesia should be considered: hypothermia, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, arterial hypoxemia, sepsis, embolism, sensory deprivation, and sensory overload.Central anticholinergic syndrome can produce delirium after anesthesia. This syndrome is caused by blockade of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the central nervous system. Stimulation of the muscarinic receptors produces decreased heart rate and contractility, bronchial constriction, salivary secretions, and intestinal and bladder contraction and relaxation of sphincters.4 The undesirable delirium or prolonged sleepiness that occurs after anesthesia is associated with use of atropine and scopolamine.Pharmacological factors specifically associated with emergence delirium include the residual effects of several anesthetic medications, including droperidol, metoclopramide, benzodiazepines, opioids, ketamine, and atropine. Droperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist used to prevent nausea and vomiting, may cause anxiety or prolonged sedation. Additionally, droperidol potentiates central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines and narcotics.Metoclopramide, used to promote gastric emptying and to prevent emesis, is also associated with extrapyramidal effects such as involuntary muscle movements. This reaction is due to passage of the drug into the central nervous system, resulting in blockade of dopamine receptors.Benzodiazepines and opioids occasionally cause prolonged recovery from anesthesia, particularly with higher doses.1,5 Depression of the central nervous system by these drugs is more common with delayed awakening from anesthesia but must also be considered when emergence delirium occurs, particularly if the patient is using other central nervous system depressants.Ketamine, a phencyclidine derivative, produces dissociative anesthesia that is defined as marked amnesia and profound analgesia.1,5 Emergence delirium after ketamine administration may result in extreme restlessness and agitation. Hallucinations and unpleasant dreams may occur postoperatively. Combining benzodiazepines with ketamine lessens these untoward effects.Signs and symptoms of emergence delirium or agitation after anesthesia include excitement and alternating periods of lethargy followed by excitement and disorientation. Inappropriate behavior such as screaming, kicking, and use of profanities also may occur. Also, the patients generally do not respond appropriately to commands.1,4,6,7Treatment of emergence delirium generally involves treatment of the signs and symptoms. The primary goal is to rule out possible physiological or pharmacological causes of the signs and symptoms (Table 2). Supplemental oxygen, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and adequate analgesia may be appropriate once the cause of the signs and symptoms has been determined. Medications used for emergence delirium include benzodiazepines for calming if the delirium is severe and antipsychotics, such as haloperidol and physostigmine, which reverse delirium associated with anticholinergics often used during general anesthesia.6 Medications such as naloxone and flumazenil may also be used to reverse oversedative effects that may be due to narcotics and benzodiazepines used intraoperatively.1,4,6,8A 47-year-old woman with no known systemic disease was admitted to the PACU after a 5-hour face-lift procedure during which she was given intravenous sedatives with monitored anesthesia care. Vital signs on admission included a blood pressure of 148/77 mm Hg, a heart rate of 90/min, spontaneous respirations of 16/min to 20/min, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient was sleeping and was nonresponsive to verbal or painful stimuli.Preoperatively, no medications were given. Intraoperatively, the patient received 2 mg of midazolam intravenously, 100 μg of fentanyl intravenously, 50 to 75 μg/kg per minute of propofol via infusion, 0.625 mg droperidol intravenously, and 3 L/m of oxygen via nasal cannula. Her vital signs remained normal throughout the 5-hour operation.After 30 minutes in the PACU, the patient remained somnolent and could not be aroused. Suddenly she began thrashing in the bed, screaming and kicking, and seemed uncontrollable. This behavior lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes and was followed by somnolence lasting 10 to 13 minutes. Again, she began shouting profanities, then relaxed momentarily. Her demeanor was irrational and inappropriate. The certified registered nurse anesthetist and surgeon were notified of the change in status and were asked to assist. During an evaluation, the patient was unresponsive to commands. Vital signs were unchanged, and oxygen saturation remained at 98% to 100%, confirming an absence of hypoxemia.The patient was given 1 mg of intravenous flumazenil and 0.4 mg of intravenous naloxone slowly over 5 minutes, but her behavior did not change. She continued to have intermittent episodes of the previously described inappropriate behavior that lasted approximately 1 to 3 minutes and were followed by rest periods of 1 to 15 minutes.Preoperatively, the patient had said that she did not use prescription medications or street drugs. She also said that she did not use herbal remedies or diet drugs. In our practice, inquiry about the use of controlled and noncontrolled substances is standard and often extensive, depending on the patient's history. This patient said that she drank alcohol socially. Because of her unexplained behavior in the PACU, her family was called. Her husband disclosed that she was using the antidepressants fluoxetine and citalopram as well as lorazepam for sleep, all doses unknown. The bottles were sitting on her bedside table at home. Additional social history was significant for marital problems, including physical and emotional abuse and extramarital affairs. The family, including the husband and stepdaughter, expressed no surprise about the patient's unusual behavior during emergence from anesthesia. In fact, they shared personal psychosocial circumstances of the patient's lifestyle, including a \"fight\" with the husband the night before surgery.After approximately 2 hours, the patient was awake and calm. Her vital signs remained stable, and she was deemed ready for discharge. For her safety, however, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and a psychiatric consultation.The patient in this case study experienced an unusual emergence from intravenous sedation. A thorough literature search revealed little information on emergence delirium occurring after intravenous sedation.Hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and other physiological factors were ruled out because of her sustained stable vital signs and full spontaneous respiration. Steps to improve cognition for this patient included reversal of benzodiazepines and narcotics, neither of which changed the patient's demeanor. Constant monitoring of vital signs revealed an oxygen saturation of 99% to 100% throughout the entire perioperative cycle. Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature were all within normal limits. Supportive nursing care included using warm blankets and staying close to the patient to protect her from injuring herself and others. Constant communication between the nursing staff, the anesthesia provider, and the surgeon provided a solid, safe approach to caring for this challenging patient.When the unusual emergence from anesthesia occurred, communicating with the patient's family generated a wealth of information. Information was obtained about her use of antidepressants and sleeping pills as well as a strongly adverse psychosocial history. The interaction of anesthetic medications with the antidepressants, whose use was unknown at the time of surgery, along with psychosocial dysfunctional issues, markedly increased the likelihood of emergence delirium for this patient. The actions of benzodiazepines, narcotics, and central nervous system hypnotics were thought to have potentiated central nervous system effects of the patient's use of antidepressants.8For personal reasons, some patients do not reveal their use of certain medications. Yet, the importance of obtaining a complete drug history is readily apparent in this case. In our outpatient surgery setting, a registered nurse, a surgeon, and a nurse anesthetist each elicit a drug history from each patient. Some patients reveal some information, some reveal no information, and some provide complete disclosure to 1 or all members of the healthcare team.Delivery of anesthetic drugs tailored individually for each patient provides the safest form of care for surgical patients. When patients willingly withhold information, the entire perioperative team may see untoward outcomes, as occurred with this patient. Our goal to obtain the most complete history from each patient remains a priority.Not all patients awaken smoothly and uneventfully after surgery and anesthesia. For this reason, all nurses who work with patients recovering from anesthesia should have a working knowledge of emergence delirium.",

      "title": "Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is characterized by clusters of nocturnal motor seizures, which are often stereotyped and brief (5 seconds to 5 minutes). They vary from simple arousals from sleep to dramatic, often bizarre hyperkinetic events with tonic or dystonic features. Affected individuals may experience aura. Retained awareness during seizures is common. A minority of individuals experience daytime seizures. Onset ranges from infancy to adulthood. About 80% of individuals develop ADNFLE in the first two decades of life; mean age of onset is ten years. Clinical neurologic examination is normal and intellect is usually preserved, but reduced intellect, psychiatric comorbidity, or cognitive deficits may occur. Within a family, the manifestations of the disorder may vary considerably. ADNFLE is lifelong but not progressive. As an individual reaches middle age, attacks may become milder and less frequent. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADNFLE is established in a proband who has suggestive clinical findings combined with a family history that is positive for other affected individuals and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CHRNA4, CHRNB2, CHRNA2, KCNT1, DEPDC5, or CRH on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Carbamazepine is associated with remission in about 70% of individuals, often in relatively low doses. Individuals with ADNFLE associated with the CHRNA4 pathogenic variant p.Ser284Leu are more responsive to zonisamide than carbamazepine. Resistance to AEDs, present in about 30% of affected individuals, requires a trial of all appropriate AEDs. Adjunctive fenofibrate therapy or vagal nerve stimulation may be considered for individuals resistant to AEDs. Surveillance: Reevaluation of EEGs at regular intervals to monitor disease progression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: A medical history from relatives at risk can identify those with ADNFLE so that treatment can be initiated promptly. Pregnancy management: Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling ADNFLE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with ADNFLE have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown, as the frequency of subtle signs of the disorder in parents has not been thoroughly evaluated and molecular genetic data are insufficient. Penetrance is estimated at 70% and the risk to each offspring of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%; thus, the chance that the offspring will manifest ADNFLE is (50% x 70% =) 35%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible.",

      "abstract": "The first episode of psychosis is the interval between the onset of the first positive psychotic symptom above the threshold for clinical psychosis for at least 1 week until the first 5 years of starting treatment. The at-risk mental state is subdivided into three ultra high-risk populations for psychosis: brief intermittent psychotic symptoms; attenuated positive symptoms syndrome; genetic risk and deterioration syndrome. The incidence of psychotic disorders varies between 15-34/100,000 person-years at risk, most of the specific diagnoses are schizophrenia. The duration of untreated psychosis is the most studied variable and closely related to the assessment of the impact of early treatment on the patient's prognosis. Psychosis can be divided into primary (affective and non-affective) or secondary causes. Intervening early in the course of psychotic illness is important as centers specialized in FEP aim reduce DUP, achieve remission of the psychotic condition, reduce recurrence, and reduce the number of hospital admissions.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disease characterized by the presence of an urge to move the legs accompanied by unpleasant sensations in the legs. The symptoms appear or increase in the evening and during the night, they are provoked by rest, and are totally or partially relieved by moving the legs [1, 2] . Diagnosis of RLS is based solely on the presence of the abovementioned symptoms without any definite objective measurement. The etiology of RLS remains unclear, but the strongest evidence supports the ‘iron theory’: symptoms of RLS are a result of peripheral and central iron deficiency leading to disturbances in dopaminergic transmission [3] . RLS is a frequent disorder – primary RLS was found in 2.4% of the general population in a recent study [4] . In another study, RLS of any form (primary and secondary) and of any frequency of symptoms was found in 7.2% of the general population [5] . The above facts (subjectivity of the symptoms, unclear etiology and high frequency in the general population) should be remembered when analyzing the data on the prevalence of RLS in other diseases.

      "abstract": "Introduction All infants cry and all cry for a reason. Indeed, the attributions applied to early infant crying range from pain to anger to boredom. In the first months of life, crying is particularly salient as infants have relatively few effective methods of communicating their needs and states. Developmentally, crying in early infancy is distinguished by its temporal qualities. Several studies have demonstrated that infants typically show an increase in their crying across the first three months, with a peak at around six to eight weeks of age. Importantly, crying decreases significantly around three to four months of age, coinciding with important developmental changes in affect, non-negative vocalizations and motor behaviour. As crying is considered a normal communicative signal, developmental outcomes for children who cry within the normal range are not of concern. However, some infants exceed the typical pattern of crying, such as those who cry long, hard and inconsolably during the first three months or those who fuss frequently beyond three to four months of age. It is these infants who are often believed to be “at risk” for developmental problems.",

      "title": "CONTRIBUTIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL AND ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY TO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY1",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY An analysis of the influence of experimental psychology on clinical psychology has made it necessary to call attention to the middleman who mediates between experimental and clinical psychology–the abnormal psychologist. Whether the clinical and experimental approaches can be synthesized in one cranium remains an unanswered question, despite the success with which the synthesis has occurred in a few rare instances. With regard to diagnosis of disorders in behaviour, by which we mean a thorough knowledge of the cause of the illness and a description of its effect on the indivdual suffering from it, such knowledge is rarely available in the mental disorders, and hence we must fall back on mere description of the characteristic way in which the patient behaves–his Symptoms and signs (the complaints and the indicators which are observable even without complaint). However, the disordered behaviour may arise from a variety of causes. Furthermore, the same type of disorder may reveal itself differently in different patients depending upon their original equipment or their personality–i. e. the systematic behaviour which characterized them before the disorder became apparent. From this point of view there are three necessary sets of information required before a diagnosis can be made: (1) pre‐morbid personality, (2) current behaviour and characteristics, and (3) the cause of the change. What has experimental psychology done to help in these three areas? First, it has provided certain psychometric devices for evaluating the current behaviour of the patient when he comes to attention. Among these are such well‐known Instruments as intelligence tests, and personality tests and laboratory techniques for measuring physiological, sensory, perceptual, psychomotor and conceptual responses under controlled stimulation as well as under idling state conditions. It has, thus far, helped but little in the provision of methods for determining pre‐morbid personality, though retrospective accounts of development and instruments for recording such data are now being developed. Some prospective studies (Mednick) are also in progress. With regard to aetiology, attempts have been made to formulate scientific models which may underlie mental disorders, ranging from ecological, developmental, and learning, to heredity, internal environmental, and neurophysiological models, and considerable research under each of these models has been engendered in an attempt to uncover the sources of the disorder. Most of these studies are conducted by research psychologists and other research scientists in various research centres: The Maudsley Hospital, the NIMH, New York Psychiatrie Institute, Max Planck Institutes, University of Paris Faculté de Médecine, the Medical Research Council in Great Britain, etc. It is to be hoped that the result of these efforts will eventually benefit the practising clinician. The techniques for testing the hypotheses emanating from these models may be divided into (1) culture‐dependent, (2) culture‐fair, and (3) culture‐free. The first will vary considerably across cultures, since it has to conform to local cultural norms in order to detect deviation in response. The second will also vary from culture to culture, but translations or equivalence across cultures can be found. The third attempts to transcend culture by remaining relatively invariant from culture to culture. It is still too early to know whether culture‐free techniques can be developed, but to the extent that they remain relatively invariant from culture to culture, they may make possible more objective cross‐cultural studies. There is one danger facing clinical psychology–the danger of being swamped by the demands for service. In the U. S. this demand has produced a severe shortage of trained personnel and an even greater shortage of research clinicians or abnormal psychologists. The fortunate countries where this has not happened yet should take heed to avoid the North American pattern. One too easy road would be to adopt North American clinical psychology by translating most of the tests and techniques. It is to be hoped that this will not become a vogue, and that each country will enrich our knowledge of human behaviour through its own heritage rather than sacrifice its past to the American mould.",

      "title": "Chronic Postoperative Pain: Connect the Dots",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Chronic postoperative pain (CPOP) is an adverse event which leads to functional disability, poor quality of life, and psychological burden for patients. Therefore, it is crucial to identify risk factors and consider preventive strategies. This particular disorder is associated with specific nerve damage with or without the manifestation of an inflammatory response. It refers to pain that lasts at least 3, 6, or 12 months after surgery. As per the IASP's new chronic pain taxonomy for the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision, CPOP has been defined as pain that develops or increases in intensity after surgery or a tissue injury and persists beyond 3 months, without other causes.[1] Although the exact mechanisms of CPOP are still uncertain, they are associated with nociceptive integration, primary afferents, and adaptation of perception conduits.[2,3] The reported incidence of CPOP varies substantially among the literature, ranging from 5% to 85%. The incidence varies with the type of surgery, the time interval used to define CPOP, and the study population. More than 50% of patients undergoing mastectomy, amputation, or thoracotomy can suffer from CPOP.[3-5] A failed surgery may lead to the continuation of a preexisting painful condition (e.g., failed back surgery) and may complicate the true incidence of CPOP. It also affects the quality of life, which results in patient disability, health care burden, and social expenses. Although the treatment of CPOP is challenging, perioperative physicians can play an essential role in the prevention using a holistic, multimodal strategy that would help this complex clinical condition. PATHOGENESIS OF CHRONIC POSTOPERATIVE PAIN The mechanisms involved in the transition from acute to chronic pain after surgery have not been fully understood. The neurobiological, psychosocial, and genetic factors have been proposed. Central nervous system neuroplasticity and multiple neurotransmitters and inflammatory mediators such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor have an important role in CPOP. These receptors are the potential target for the prevention and treatment of CPOP, e.g., the use of perioperative ketamine to prevent chronic pain after surgery. Tissue injury during surgery leads to various degrees of nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic processes and central sensitization. Although inconclusive, the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens have been implicated in maladaptive processes such as fear avoidance.[6-9] Not all patients develop CPOP even after high-risk surgery such as mastectomy and limb amputation. Pain-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been proposed to play an essential role in metabolism and immune regulation.[10,11] Various biomarkers beyond genes, including proteins, lipids, and metabolites, are being studied for chronic pain after surgery.[12] PREDICTION AND PREVENTION OF CHRONIC POSTOPERATIVE PAIN The transition from acute to chronic is not always predictable; patients may have a pain-free period before developing CPOP. For diagnosis, other treatable causes for the pain, such as progression of disease or a surgical complication, should be ruled out. Early perioperative identification of risk factors can allow the implementation of preventative treatment strategies. Any surgical procedures that are associated with nerve damage are most likely to be associated with an increased risk of CPOP, such as axillary nerve during axillary dissection for breast surgery or ilioinguinal nerve during hernia repair surgery. Limb amputation, spine surgery, thoracotomy, breast surgery, arthroplasty, etc., are high-risk procedures which are associated with a high incidence of CPOP. The incidence of CPOP with limb amputation and thoracotomy has been reported to be up to 80%.[5,13,14] A poorly controlled acute postoperative pain has been associated with the risk of CPOP. Severe acute pain may result in central sensitization with strong noxious inputs. A meta-analysis has shown that poor postoperative pain control was associated with an increased risk of CPOP in patients who underwent breast cancer surgery.[15] Besides these, various demographic factors such as young age, female gender, preexisting pain, and depression have been associated with increased risk. In the past, several attempts have been made to develop a reliable prediction model for CPOP. However, these models suffer a high risk of bias and lack external validation. A prospective multicenter study identified six independent factors: type of surgical procedure, age, physical health, mental health, preoperative pain in the surgical field and preoperative pain in another area. These risks were used in a prediction model and validated, which showed predictive value with a sensitivity of 58.9% and specificity of 68.4%.[16-18] Performing less extensive surgery may reduce the risk of CPOP. Laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery is expected to have less chronic pain than open surgery. However, the results are still uncertain.[19,20] The role of anesthetic agents or analgesic techniques on the incidence of CPOP is unclear. However, regional anesthesia techniques such as peripheral nerve blocks and wound infiltration, as a part of multimodal analgesia after surgery, may improve acute postoperative analgesia and reduce CPOP. Perioperative regional anesthesia reduces the risk of CPOP by blocking nociceptive stimulus to the central nervous system and reducing central sensitization processes. Epidural analgesia and paravertebral blocks reduce the incidence of CPOP in patients undergoing thoracotomy. Although the level of evidence is low, local anesthetic wound infiltration after breast cancer surgery and cesarean section seem to have beneficial effects on CPOP.[21,22] Chronic opioid use is a risk factor for persistent postoperative pain, which leads to opioid tolerance, facilitated central sensitization, and altered descending inhibition. A randomized controlled trial showed that a high intraoperative remifentanil dosage is associated with a higher incidence of CPOP in comparison with sevoflurane-based anesthesia after thoracotomy (33.5 vs. 50.6%, respectively).[23] Considering opioid-sparing or free analgesia using multimodal analgesia and regional analgesia techniques can reduce the incidence of CPOP. Several analgesics and adjuncts, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gabapentinoids, ketamine, and lidocaine, are used for effective perioperative pain control. However, a meta-analysis showed the inconclusive benefit of ketamine and pregabalin on the prevalence of CPOP in comparison to a placebo. Similarly, perioperative administration of intravenous (IV) lidocaine may reduce any degree of pain at 6 months after breast surgery; however, it did not reduce the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain at 3 or 6 months. Although its role in CPOP is uncertain, these drugs may assist acute postoperative pain management and reduce the development of CPOP.[9,24] CPOP is also dependent on psychosocial and temporal aspects. Considering the possible underlying mechanisms, interventions only during the perioperative period might not be effective. A multidisciplinary approach, including nonpharmacological treatment such as physiotherapy and psychological support, is effective. The concept of transitional pain services has been proposed, which is a multidisciplinary team that follows the high-risk patient perioperatively and several weeks after surgery. It fills the gap between acute postoperative pain management and postdischarge pain management.[25] To conclude, any persistent pain after the operation should not be underestimated. It can be a clinical and socioeconomic challenge. At-risk patients must be identified, considering various procedure-specific and patient-related risk factors. Although the evidence for most pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapy is inconclusive, it is prudent to have effective acute pain management after surgery by adopting multimodal strategies and regional techniques and limiting the use of perioperative opioids. A practical multidisciplinary approach to the management of CPOP warrants further evaluation.",

      "title": "Advances in the Treatment of Secondary CNS Lymphoma",
      "abstract": "Secondary involvement of the CNS by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in less than 1% to more than 10% of patients with DLBCL depending on the presence or absence of five risk factors that compose the International Prognostic Index (age, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, poor performance status, advanced stage, and involvement of one extranodal site). Involvement of the kidneys and/or adrenal glands has been found to represent a site-specific additional risk factor for secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL). Other risk models have been proposed but not validated. It is also likely that molecular features of the tumor (eg, presence of MYC or BCL2 rearrangements, double-hit lymphomas) will add to or substitute for these clinical risk factors in the near future. SCNSL occurs early (frequently within weeks to months) after diagnosis of systemic disease; can affect the brain (or spinal cord and cranial nerves), the meninges, or both; and until recently, was almost always fatal. Because progression or relapse in the CNS occurs this early after diagnosis, most investigators believe that a significant number of patients prone to develop SCNSL harbor lymphoma cells in the brain parenchyma or the CSF at the time of diagnosis. Modern state-of-the-art techniques like magnetic resonance imaging or fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of CSF are much more sensitive in detecting SCNSL compared with clinical judgment, computed tomography scans, or microscopic interpretation of cytospin smears and probably would allow documentation of CNS involvement in an unknown but potentially significant number of patients scoring as CNS negative when traditional methodology is used. As a first step, however, consensus is needed regarding which patients are considered at high enough risk to warrant CNS-specific diagnostic approaches that will likely yield negative results in the majority of patients, will create discomfort, if not more serious adverse effects, in some patients, and will increase costs. The ability to identify patients with documented CNS disease could prompt immediate management with a CNS-specific treatment protocol, whereas patients who are CNS negative by magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis (for instance) would receive immunochemotherapy like any other patient with DLBCL. Alternatively, the highest risk group might be candidates for CNS prophylaxis. With most retrospective analyses showing no benefit of intrathecal (IT) injections of cytotoxic drugs (methotrexate [MTX], cytarabine [Ara-C], prednisone, or combinations thereof), this prophylactic strategy can no longer be generally be recommended. If deemed necessary, more complex and more toxic approaches, such as administration of systemic high-dose MTX or combinations of cytotoxic drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as pioneered with the French doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisone regimen, should be considered. Treatment of SCNSL with IT injections, whole-brain radiotherapy, or systemic administration of cytotoxic drugs that do not cross the BBB has largely been ineffective. Only when repeated courses of high-dose MTX and Ara-C were introduced did patients begin to show measurable benefit and survive significantly longer; cure, however, remained the exception to the rule. Until today, virtually all other drugs known to cross the BBB (procarbazine, etoposide, ifosfamide, thiotepa, carmustine [BCNU], and others) have been used mostly in combination with MTX and/or Ara-C to further improve results. As with MTX and Ara-C, most other drugs seem to be most effective at high doses, necessitating transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Consequently, the most recent and successful protocols to treat primary and secondary CNS lymphoma consist of complex treatment algorithms encompassing two or more courses of high-dose MTX and/or Ara-C administered together with other BBB-crossing agents, followed by high-dose therapy combining BBB-crossing agents like BCNU, thiotepa, busulfan, oretoposide,whichcanbedoseescalatediftransplantationofhematopoietic stem cells ensues. The first prospective phase II study demonstrating the potential of this strategy was reported by Korfel et al. Patients up to age 65 years received induction chemotherapy with high-dose MTX, ifosfamide, and dexamethasone followed by high-dose Ara-C, thiotepa, and dexamethasone. Responding patients were consolidated with highdose therapy consisting of BCNU, thiotepa, and etoposide and transplantation of autologous blood stem cells. With this approach, the 2-year treatment failure rate was 49% 19% and the 2-year overall survival rate was 63% 19%. Another study was reported by Doorduyn et al in 2012; this study, which is not fully published yet, is of particular interest because for the first time rituximab was given with the cytotoxic agents. Because many patients with lymphoma experiencing relapse in the CNS had received rituximab as part of conventional first-line therapy until shortly before relapse and intravenous rituximab does not result in significant therapeutic concentrations in the CNS when the BBB is intact, early protocols including high-dose therapy/ASCT did not use rituximab or any other lymphoma-directed antibody. After it was appreciated that rituximab monotherapy can induce short-lived remissions in patients with CNS disease and thus must be able to penetrate into the CNS of JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY E D I T O R I A L VOLUME 33 NUMBER 33 NOVEMBER 2",

At least 15% of women on OCs were classified as suffering from depression. Other symptoms were nausea headache increase of appetite anxiety increased or decreased libido.

This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "abstract": ": Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are a rising entity particularly among adolescents, that might be highly impairing. In the past, many terms such as psychosomatic symptoms, somatisation, functional disorders, somatoform disease have been used to define a heterogeneous group of physical symptoms without any organic underlying disease, but somehow related to emotional or psychological aspects of the patients’ life. Recently, the term MUS has been preferred as it captures the full range of conditions characterized by persistent physical symptoms that cannot yet be explained by any medical illness or injury. In the last years, there has been an increasing interest about MUS, which represent a significant disorder among adolescents, particularly in females. At present, MUS in adolescents is a great challenge for paediatricians and primary care physicians, but since its prevalence is increasing, it will become even more relevant in the next years. Necessarily, adolescents with unexplained physical symptoms and their families seek out medical assistance, through the general paediatrician, disease specialists or the emergency department. However, medical assistance itself, if not adequate or delayed, can maintain or even worsen the symptoms in an escalating vicious circle. The result is often cyclic disability, frustration and missed opportunities to collaborate to enhance the patient functionality. On the other hand, many paediatricians have inadequate knowledge of MUS and its approach, evaluation and management. Thus, my report will focus on MUS and specifically on epidemiological and on its variable clinical presentation. I will also discuss the possible risk factors for MUS especially focusing on adolescent’s personality and emotional disorders, cognitive and learning difficulties, previous adverse life or traumatic events, family medical or psychiatric history and on the school and peer group environment. Furthermore, the optimal evaluation strategy, which requires a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach, including medical and psychosocial assessment, will be extensively discussed. Such integrate way to manage adolescents with MUS should limit the high, often disproportionate, amounts of medical interventions required, such as numerous ER visits or hospitalizations, and unnecessary investigations. Last but not least, I will outline the successful management strategy for MUS. Primarily, engagement of families and patients is crucial; psychotherapy and physiotherapy are also winning weapons, whether associated with a good alliance between patient, family and paediatrician. Frequently, the appropriate intervention should also include an early psychiatric referral. In fact, a strict collaboration between paediatricians and psychiatrists may promote prompt confirmation of the diagnosis, but also timely treatment could improve the adolescent’s quality life, preventing the social and personal negative consequences. By way of example, I will describe few cases with different clinical presenting features recently admitted to our hospital, providing the details of their diagnostic approach, the multidisciplinary management and outcome.",

CP/CPPS should not be viewed from a restrictive biomedical model because pain is not a purely physical phenomenon, but rather a complex physical, emotional, and interpersonal fusion, where the negative outcomes are suggested to advance over time if left unchecked.",

      "abstract": "(1) A technique, based upon Spearman's tetrad difference criterion, has been evolved for the empirical determination of the syndromes of psychiatry. (2) This technique has given in a purely empirical manner eight syndromes and their constituent symptoms. (1) The Syndrome of Cognitive Defect which is positively related to præcox conditions but, negatively, to manic-depressive. (2) The Catatonic Syndrome, probably the inhibitory phase of dementia praæcox. (3) The Uninhibited or Kinetic Syndrome, probably the excited phase of dementia præcox. (4) The Non-Euphoric Manic Syndrome, which is probably also a phase or form of dementia præcox. (5) The Euphoric Manic Syndrome, which is probably the underlying condition in the manic form of manic-depressive insanity. (6) The Delusional Hallucinatory Syndrome, also a factor in dementia præcox. (7) The Syndrome of Constitutional Hereditary Depression, which indicates an hereditary factor that attacks the controlling mechanism of emotional life or heightens emotivity, but leaves the cognitive general factor untouched. (8) The Syndrome of Retarded Depression, which is not as yet clearly differentiated. (3) Reasons are given for regarding these syndromes as neurological defects of a definite nature.

Functional coma is an extremely rare disorder with only 21 described cases in the literature. The disease is linked to a conversion disorder or a dissociative disorder and is predominantly found in females. Predisposing factors are a history of sexual or physical abuse, psychiatric disorders, previous episodes of functional coma, and recent surgery with general anesthesia. Several clinical signs are suggestive for the diagnosis, however none of them is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Therefore, functional coma remains an exclusion diagnosis. Vital signs must be normal, just as a routine blood examination, an electroencephalogram and imaging of the central nervous system. The most important differential diagnosis are catatonia, factitious disorder, and malingering. Spontaneous recovery can be expected after a duration of about 45 minutes to 4 days.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "A 60-year-old, right-handed woman, with no focal brain lesions, suffered from a progressive impairment in recognising people of personal relevance and public figures familiar to her in the premorbid period. The patient did not suffer from general cognitive deterioration. There was no ecological or clear psychometric evidence of visuoperceptual or visuospatial deficits. Her defective person recognition was not overcome by extra-facial (e.g., observing animated people in their usual surroundings) or extra-visual information (e.g., listening to the voice). Moreover, presenting the correct name in the presence of an unrecognised familiar person failed to prompt her familiarity judgement, or retrieval of the relevant biographical knowledge. The patient also had some recognition difficulties with famous buildings and songs as well as with some common objects. It is argued that the patient's difficulty in identifying familiar people was the consequence of progressive loss of stored exemplars of familiar persons and perhaps also of some other \"unique items\" (famous songs and monuments) in an independent subsystem of semantics that we term \"exemplar semantics.\" We discuss the associative (semantic) nature and specificity of the deficit in person knowledge, the possible top-down negative influences of the loss of exemplars in the person recognition system, and the link between the disorders and the right/left temporal lobe.",

      "title": "Understanding the correlates of manic episode in a woman with insular glioma",
      "abstract": "Sir, Psychiatric manifestations are common in patients with brain tumors and sometimes psychiatric symptoms are the only manifestation in these patients.[1] The common psychiatric manifestations are psychosis, mood symptoms, cognitive symptoms, changes in personality, and changes in eating or sexual behavior.[1] It is often difficult to ascertain the development of psychiatric manifestations with the course of the brain tumor. The interventions done for the treatment of brain tumor may also attribute to development of psychiatric manifestations. We highlight here a case (after obtaining informed consent) of insular glioma, who developed manic symptoms after neurosurgical and radiotherapy intervention. The management issues are also discussed. A 36-year-old female of rural background presented in the outpatient services of psychiatry with the complaints of increased irritability, increased talkativeness, grandiose talks, increased physical activity, increased religiosity and reduced sleep for the past 1 month. The symptoms would persist for most part of the day and due to which she would not be able to perform the daily chores. It was the first episode of psychiatric illness. History revealed that there was 3 episodes of generalized tonic clonic type of seizure around 1 year back. She had consulted in a neurosurgery unit and investigated for seizure. Her magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed left insular high-grade glioma. She had undergone left frontotemporal craniotomy for the same around 8 months back and tumor was removed [Figure 1]. Her postoperative period was uneventful. She was started on phenytoin 300 mg/day after surgery and also completed the course of radiotherapy over a period of 4 months. Neuropsychological assessment (on NIMHANS battery) in the post-operative period revealed mild deficits in sustained attention, delayed recall and verbal fluency. However, her recent and remote memory, visual retention and recognition and performance abilities were intact. There was no history of any other medical illness. Her family history was also uneventful. Premorbidly, she was well adjusted to life. There was no history of any psychoactive substance abuse.Figure 1: Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showing near total excision of left insular glioma (a-c). At the depth of the surgical cavity, the internal capsule is visualized (a and c) which was carefully protected during surgery. Hyperintensity around the surgical cavity may indicate small infiltrating tumor residue or postoperative gliosis (c)Her general physical examination and systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality except gum hypertrophy (adverse effect of phenytoin therapy). Her routine hemogram, liver function test, and kidney function test were within normal limits. She was diagnosed with Mania without psychotic symptoms as per the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems-10 diagnostic criteria for research diagnostic criteria. She was started sodium valproate 750 mg/day, and phenytoin was tapered off and gradually stopped. Her seizure was controlled, and manic symptoms were significantly improved over 3 weeks' time. At the end of 3 months, her symptoms were completely resolved. Among the mood symptoms associated with glioma, depressive features are more common.[2] The presence of brain lesions in an individual cannot be always to the psychiatric manifestations present in the person.[3] In our patient, there are many potential causes (tumor in the left temporal lobe, temporal lobectomy, brain tissue damage due to radiotherapy as well seizure episodes) that might have attributed to the development of psychiatric symptoms. However, none of the events temporally correlated with the onset of psychiatric manifestations. Stress response to all these major medical issues might be attributed to the psychopathology. Evidence suggest that a significant number of patients with glioma experience stress during their hospitalization and thereafter.[4] Stress can have a potential role in the development of psychiatric disorder and seems to be of relevance in our case. A mood episode independent of glioma seems to be a sound explanation in this case. Patient's manic symptoms resolved completely with sodium valproate, which is a potent antiepileptic agent as well as a mood stabilizer. Other antiepileptic agents like– phenytoin, phenobarbitone, topiramate, levetiracetam, lacosamide, zonisamide, and benzodiazepines lack the mood stabilizing the property. Choosing valproate as a medication for seizure prophylaxis, will not only ensure a seizure-free recovery; its mood stabilizing property will also take care of manic symptoms as well as aggression. The clinician needs to be cautious enough in considering the psychiatric diagnosis as well as selection of appropriate medication for its treatment. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach might be more useful in this regards. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

The complexity of the disorder and its peculiar clinical characteristics are explained. Some of these characteristics are: (1) the predominant 1–3-year age range, which corresponds to the anal stage of development; (2) the relief afforded by vomiting; (3) the occurrence of attacks at night and during sleep, (4) the relative dryness of the cough and its harsh metallic quality; (5) the frequent presence of a ticklish, irritating sensation in the throat; and (6) the presence of edema and/or laryngospasm. Three case vignettes are presented. These cases support a previously developed theory concerning the impulses and defenses underlying the croup attack. Croup is seen as a fixation at the oral level with a regression to that level in the face of conflicts of the anal or sometimes the oedipal stage.

Both were transferred from other asylums, apparently incurable. In each instance the primary condition was one of melancholia, with marked suicidal tendencies, giving place, after a considerable interval, to a definite and prolonged maniacal phase. In one case the resumption of pursuits, abstention from which had presumably brought on the attack, seemed to be the main agent in restoring the mental balance; in the other the shock of a physical injury appeared to be the starting point in the road to convalescence.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "title": "The syndrome of transient epileptic amnesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Transient amnesia can be the principal manifestation of epilepsy. This diagnosis, however, is seldom suspected by clinicians and remains controversial. The amnestic attacks are often associated with persistent memory complaints. This study was designed to provide the first description of transient epileptic amnesia in a substantial series of patients. Methods Fifty patients were recruited over 18 months using the following diagnostic criteria: (1) recurrent, witnessed episodes of amnesia; (2) other cognitive functions intact during attacks; and (3) compelling evidence of epilepsy. We assessed clinical features and performed neuropsychological evaluation in cases and 24 matched control subjects. Results Transient epileptic amnesia develops in later life (mean onset, 62 years). Amnestic episodes are frequent (median, 12/year), brief (median duration, 30–60 minutes), and often occur on waking (37/50 cases). Epilepsy was the initial specialist diagnosis in only 12 of 50 cases. Attacks ceased on anticonvulsant medication in 44 of 47 treated patients. A total of 40 of 50 cases described persistent memory difficulties. Despite normal performance on standard memory tests, patients exhibited accelerated forgetting of verbal and visual material over 3 weeks by comparison with matched control subjects ( p &lt; 0.001). They also showed loss of autobiographical memories for events extending back over 40 years ( p &lt; 0.05). Interpretation We propose that transient epileptic amnesia is a distinctive epilepsy syndrome, typically misdiagnosed at presentation and associated with accelerated long‐term forgetting and autobiographical amnesia. The syndrome is of clinical and theoretic importance. Ann Neurol 2007",

      "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are more common on Mondays than other days of the week. The stress of returning to work at the beginning of the week has been postulated as a possible trigger factor. This project examined the weekly variation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of nontraumatic origin for the entire case series as well as for selected subgroups. A retrospective analysis of 1,498 incidences between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1996 revealed a distinct Monday peak in occurrence irrespective of age, gender, presence of witnesses, primary survival, or primary ECG. This finding, however, was most pronounced in retired patients, subjects living alone, and persons found unconscious outside buildings or in public places. One important trigger of cardiac arrest is going to work after weekends; however, resumption of social and other activities on Mondays is another possible trigger. Other factors, such as endogenous biological rhythms, may contribute to an increased risk at this particular time even in elderly.",

The underlying desire is often overshadowed by the act of sexual violation and when using GHB or GBL to induce unconsciousness, as in the case presented here, the victim might not even be able to recall, for certain, that they have been sexually violated. A case study is offered of a somnophile who adulterated drinks to render young men unconscious, so he could rape them in that state, before progressing to administering drugs anally on the pretext of applying lubrication to the anus to facilitate sexual intercourse. The offender's fetishistic compulsion to have sex with unconscious men propelled him to experiment with the means by which he surreptitiously administered drugs to his victims in order to deepen their comatose state.",

      "abstract": "Not every individual develops Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after the exposure to a potentially traumatic event. Therefore, the identification of pre-existing risk factors and early diagnostic biomarkers is of high medical relevance. However, no objective biomarker has yet progressed into clinical practice. Sleep disturbances represent commonly reported complaints in PTSD patients. In particular, changes in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) properties are frequently observed in PTSD patients. Here, we examined in a mouse model of PTSD whether (1) mice developed REMS alterations after trauma and (2) whether REMS architecture before and/or shortly after trauma predicted the development of PTSD-like symptoms. We monitored sleep-wake behavior via combined EEG/EMG recordings immediately before (24 h pre), immediately after (0-48 h post) and two months after exposure to an electric foot shock in male C57BL/6N mice (n=15). PTSD-like symptoms, including hyperarousal, contextual and generalized fear, were assessed one month post-trauma. Shocked mice showed early-onset and sustained elevation of REMS compared to non-shocked controls. In addition, REMS architecture before trauma was correlated with the intensity of acoustic startle responses, but not contextual fear, one month after trauma. Our data suggest REMS as prognostic (pre-trauma) and symptomatic (post-trauma) marker of PTSD-like symptoms in mice. Translated to the situation in humans, REMS may constitute a viable, objective and non-invasive biomarker in PTSD and other trauma-related psychiatric disorders, which could guide pharmacological interventions in humans at high risk.",

There are, however, certain occasions when the necessity arises for the establishment of a definite diagnosis as early as possible. In the average hospital case, the period of observation necessary will be a matter of days or, at the most, a week or so, but in cases of irregular seizures at infrequent intervals, this period may have to be extended into months before any opinion can be offered. It is with a view to curtailing this period of observation that an attempt has been made in this investigation to determine a method whereby the condition can be diagnosed with a degree of certainty in the absence of seizures.",

When a death is due to choking, one must consider what conditions contributed to or predisposed the person to choking (eg. alcohol, drugs and physical and mental impairments). Homicidal deaths by choking are relatively uncommon, being more frequently accidental. The diagnosis of death by choking is made at autopsy when the airway is found occluded. If the individual had an occluded airway and the object or food was removed during resuscitation, the only way to make the diagnosis would be on the history. Here, we present a case of asphyxia (accidental or suicidal) by choking on a handkerchief in a patient with a long history of schizophrenia. The woman had attempted a previous suicide driven by evil spirits coming from inside her body, especially from the head and throat; in order to \"shut-up\" the spirit, she was trying to suffocate it with her hands or by a belt from her pants.",

In women, the cycle of sexual response begins in the brain, where a memory, an image, a scent, music, or a fantasy acts as a trigger to prompt sexual arousal. Thus, the brain is really the key and starting place for treatment of sexual dysfunction. Decreased libido, altered arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, and dyspareunia are the four broad types of sexual dysfunction in women. Decreased libido, thought to be related to androgenic hormones, results in delayed or altered arousal, decreased vaginal lubrication and dilation, delayed or absent orgasm, and pain or dyspareunia, which can lead to an aversion to sexual experiences.",

      "abstract": "DEFINITION Ohtahara syndrome (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression bursts), is the earliest developing form of epileptic encephalopathy. ETHIOLOGY It considered to be a result of static structural developing brain damage. CLINICAL PICTURE Variable seizures develop mostly within the first 10 days of life, but may occur during the first hour after delivery. The most frequently observed seizure type are epileptic spasms, which may be either generalized and symmetrical or lateralized. The tonic spasms may occur in clusters or singly, while awake and during sleep alike. The duration of spasms is up to 10 seconds, and the interval between spasms within cluster ranges from 9 to 15 seconds. In one third of cases, other seizure types include partial motor seizures or hemiconvulsions The disorder takes a progressively deteriorating course with increasing frequency of seizures and severe retardation of psychomotor development. DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP In the initial stage of Ohtahara syndrome, interictal EEG shows a pattern of suppression-burst with high-voltage paroxysmal discharges separated by prolonged periods of nearly flat tracing that last for up to 18 seconds. PROGNOSIS AND THREATMENT Half of the reported children having Ohtahara syndrome die in infancy. Anticonvulsant helps little in controlling the seizures and halting the deterioration of psychomotor development. Severe psychomotor retardation is the rule. With time, the disorder may evolve into West syndrome or partial epilepsy. Psychomotor development may be slightly better if the infants do not develop West and later Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Benign neonatal seizures is a rare but increasingly recognized syndrome characterized by seizures in the neonatal or infantile period. Two forms are recognized: familial and nonfamilial. In both instances, the seizures may be quite severe, and status epilepticus is common. The nonfamilial form is characterized by idiopathic, self-limited seizures occurring in previously normal neonates. The seizures most commonly occur at day 5 and have been called \"fifth-day fits\" by some authors. Familial seizures most frequently have their onset during the first week of life, but onset may occur as late as early infancy. These seizures may recur for several months before resolving. No cause is found for the seizures, and the patient appears healthy during the interictal period. The family history reveals benign neonatal seizures in other family members. Although the prognosis is favorable in both syndromes, seizures may occasionally occur later in life in the familial form. The familial form of benign neonatal seizures is autosomal dominant, and the gene has been localized to chromosome 20.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "title": "Molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in status epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency, characterized by continuous or intermittent seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures, which can result in death or neurologic sequelae. In about one-third of patients, SE is unresponsive to sequential treatment with first- and second-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The two most important variables that influence the response of SE to AEDs are the underlying etiology and the duration of SE (Neligan & Shorvon, 2008). With respect to etiology, acute structural brain disorders (e.g., encephalitis, stroke, and trauma) resulting in SE in previously nonepileptic patients are particularly likely to be refractory. Conversely, in cases of acute SE in previously nonepileptic patients, for which no etiology is found, the outcome is usually much better. With respect to duration of SE, the longer the seizure persists (typically >1 h), the more likely is the seizure to be unresponsive to AED therapy, the higher is the mortality, and the worse is the prognosis in survivors. Similar observations have been reported in rat models of SE. In rats, SE can be induced with chemical agents or by electrical stimulation. Chemical models of SE include systemic administration of the convulsants kainic acid or pilocarpine, whereas electrical models include hippocampal or amygdala stimulation via depth electrodes. In such models, seizures rapidly become self-sustaining and continue long after the withdrawal of the convulsive stimulus. Various molecular and functional changes are thought to play a role in the transition from single seizures to self-sustained SE and in the development of time-dependent pharmacoresistance in rat SE models (Chen & Wasterlain, 2006; Wasterlain & Chen, 2008). These changes include alterations in the functional properties of hippocampal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors and enhanced trafficking of GABAA receptors (or receptor subunits) from the synaptic membrane to the cytosol, resulting in a loss of GABA-mediated inhibition. At the same time, glutamate receptor subunits, including alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtypes, move to the synaptic membrane where they form additional excitatory receptors. These changes are likely to explain progressive resistance to AEDs acting on GABAA receptors, whereas anticonvulsant NMDA or AMPA antagonists remain highly effective in terminating SE (Wasterlain & Chen, 2008). These findings, however, do not easily explain resistance to AEDs, such as phenytoin, that do not primarily act via GABA receptors. It is conceivable that AED targets other than GABA or glutamate receptors are also affected by sustained seizure activity. For instance, molecular and functional changes in voltage-dependent sodium channels, which are targets of phenytoin and various other major AEDs, have been found after a pilocarpine-induced SE in rats (Ellerkmann et al., 2003; Remy & Beck, 2006). Furthermore, a decrease in surface expression of potassium channels has been described after prolonged SE (Lugo et al., 2008). Another explanation for the progressive loss of AED efficacy with ongoing SE activity would be increased expression of drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at the blood–brain barrier, which would decrease brain concentrations of AEDs that are substrates for Pgp (Löscher, 2007). However, recent experiments in two rat models of SE did not result in any evidence supporting this possibility (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008; Kuteykin-Teplyakov et al., 2009). Pgp expression at brain capillary endothelial cells was not increased during or shortly after SE, but only 2 days following SE. This was substantiated by studying the mRNA expression of the genes (Mdr1a, Mdr1b) encoding for Pgp in rats. Furthermore, the selective Pgp inhibitor, tariquidar, did not counteract resistance of a pilocarpine-induced SE to phenobarbital or phenytoin (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008). In our hands, the only effective treatment for terminating a pilocarpine-induced SE was a combination of phenobarbital and diazepam (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008), which may be explained by the fact that phenobarbital, in addition to modulating GABAA receptors, blocks glutamatergic excitation at AMPA/kainate receptors (Rogawski & Löscher, 2004), so that combining these two AEDs results in a synergistic effect on GABAA receptors plus an antiglutamatergic effect. Other potential mechanisms of drug resistance of SE include induction of proinflammatory mediators and neuronal damage. SE has been shown to induce cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα); complement; and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, that is, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins in the brain (Vezzani & Granata, 2005). The induction of these mediators may be involved in alterations in the blood–brain barrier, increased neuronal hyperexcitability, and neuronal degeneration, all of which may affect AED efficacy. However, at least in our hands, induction of proinflammatory mediators by SE did not develop rapidly enough to explain resistance of SE to AEDs (Kuteykin-Teplyakov et al., 2009). These alterations, however, may be critically involved in the development of epilepsy and neuronal damage after SE, as indicated by the disease-modifying effects of treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, administered after a pilocarpine-induced SE (Jung et al., 2006). Interestingly, neurodegeneration developing after SE could be significantly reduced or prevented by treatment with the NMDA-antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine), administered together with diazepam after kainate- or pilocarpine-induced SE (Brandt et al., 2003; Bankstahl et al., 2008), substantiating that SE-induced release of glutamate is involved in brain damage. Therefore, combining diazepam with an NMDA antagonist such as ketamine may not only be an advantageous treatment for terminating SE (Martin & Kapur, 2008; Wasterlain & Chen, 2008), but may also prevent part of the long-term consequences of SE. Apart from molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, the severity of SE may play a role in the response to AED treatment. We recently demonstrated in rats that SE induced by pilocarpine was more resistant to AEDs than an electrically induced SE, and also induced more severe brain damage than determined in the electrical model (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008). So one may speculate that drug resistance, at least in part, is a mere expression of higher SE severity (and/or the severity of the underlying condition), rather than of molecular or functional alterations developing as a result of sustained seizure activity. In conclusion, mechanisms of drug resistance in SE are only incompletely understood. Important variables that influence the response of SE to AEDs are the underlying etiology and the duration of SE, but several other variables may be involved, including disease-related, patient-related, and drug-related factors (Table 1). Initiating treatment of SE with two drugs that have different mechanisms of action (e.g., a benzodiazepine plus a barbiturate or an NMDA antagonist) might increase chances of success. It is hoped that a better understanding of the factors and mechanisms involved in refractory SE might help us to improve its treatment.

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

Migraine attacks are also accompanied by at least one of nausea, vomiting, and photophobia and phonophobia.1 It is 25 years since triptans first became available on prescription. Although their safety and efficacy is well established, there is still a great deal of ongoing research into the nuances of their use in treating patients with specific needs. Frovatriptan, in common with other triptans, is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist.1 Frovatriptan also shows moderate affinity for 5-HT7 receptors,1 resulting in more potent contraction of cerebral arteries than coronary arteries, with the potential for good efficacy and low risk of unwanted effects.1 Frovatriptan is distinctive from other triptans due to its half-life of 26 hours, which confers a longer duration of action.1",

Psychological support is also wanted for those who will have to adjust to continued childlessness.",

Factors influencing the increased risk of hearing loss relate, for example, to abortion, older age, too frequent exposure to noise. Hearing loss usually occurs gradually. Symptoms that may indicate hearing loss are buzzing or tinnitus, dizziness, balance problems, ear pain, or a feeling of a foreign object. It is important to check the hearing in newborns in order to react in time to possible irregularities. Symptoms of deafness in a child occur in the form of non-response to sounds and lack of interest in musical toys. Children between the ages of 8 and 12 months will not respond to their name in case of hearing loss, and the absence of speech is possible",

      "title": "MASGUTOVA METHOD OF REFLEX INTEGRATION FOR CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY",
      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

Post-stroke sexual dysfunctions seem to be common; in men affected by stroke, a decline in libido and poor or curtailed erection and ejaculation are frequently observed. Sexual disorders after stroke are thought to be due to multiple etiologies, including both organic (e.g., lesion localization, premorbid medical conditions, medications) and psychosocial (e.g., fear of recurrences, loss of self-esteem, role changes, anxiety and depression) etiologies.

It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

Post-fall syndrome (PFS) is commonly known and yet poorly studied. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objective:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Identify risk factors for PFS and do a follow-up 1 year later. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included all patients over 70 years of age hospitalized after suffering a fall in a case-control study, and then followed them in a cohort study. PFS was retained in case of functional mobility decline (transferring, walking) occurring following a fall in the absence of an acute neurological, orthopedic or rheumatic pathology directly responsible for the decline. The data initially collected were: clinical (anamnestic, emergency and departmental/ward evolution, medical history, lifestyle, treatments, clinical examination items); and imaging if the patient had been subjected to brain imaging in the last 3 years prior to inclusion. Regarding the follow-up at 1 year, we collected from the general physician the occurrence and the characteristics of new falls, functional mobility assessment, hospitalization and death. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Inclusion took place from March 29, 2016 to June 7, 2016 and follow-up until June 30, 2017. We included 70 patients. A total of 29 patients exhibited a PFS (41.4 %). Risk factors for PFS included age, walking disorder prior to the fall, the use of a walking aid prior to the fall, no unaccompanied outdoor walk in the week before the fall, visual impairment making close reading impossible, stiffness in ankle dorsiflexion, grip strength and the fear of falling. Among patients with PFS, 52.9% could still perform a transfer at 1 year and 64.7% could still walk against 80.7% and 85.2%, respectively, for patients without PFS. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The study showed the existence of body functions/structure impairments and activity limitations prior to the fall among patients exhibiting a PFS. This suggests the existence of a pre-fall syndrome, i.e., a psychomotor disadaptation syndrome existing prior to the fall. Among the 8 risk factors, fear of falling, vision impairment and muscle strength could be targeted for improvement. The diagnosis of PFS could be a marker of loss of functional mobility at 1 year.",

In the non-lateralized cases, onset was bilateral. In the one intermittent case, while her tinnitus was absent her pulsatile tinnitus could be induced by somatic testing. No etiology was found from physical examination, imaging, or ancillary testing. Because these cases of pulsatile tinnitus can be both induced and suppressed by activation of the somatosensory system of the head or upper lateral neck, we propose that this syndrome is occurring from (a) cardiac synchronous somatosensory activation of the central auditory pathway or (b) failure of the somatosensory-auditory central nervous system interactions to suppress cardiac somatosounds.",

      "title": "SIGNIFICANCE OF POSTSTROKE URINARY INCONTINENCE AS A NEGATIVE PREDICTOR OF FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY ON THE BASIS OF AGING",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Multiple and interactive factors contribute to development of urinary incontinence (UI), especially in geriatric stroke patients. Stroke is one of the neurological disorders that causes detrusor hyperreflexia, which is generally manifested clinically as urge incontinence.1 Impairment of bladder contractility can accompany urge incontinence in frail elderly patients. Such patients have involuntary detrusor contractions yet must strain to empty their bladders, either incompletely or completely. These patients have symptoms of obstruction and stress incontinence in addition to elevated postvoid residual volume (PVR).2 In addition, chronic impairments of physical and cognitive functioning may cause urine loss, a condition commonly termed functional incontinence.3 Incidence of poststroke urinary incontinence (PSUI) and the effect of PSUI on functional outcome on the basis of aging was assessed in 163 subjects with stroke consecutively admitted (65 women, 98 men; mean age 64.8, mean time from onset to rehabilitation 15.0 weeks, mean length of stay 4.8 weeks) to two separate rehabilitation centers affiliated with the same university. Chi-square tests were performed to define significance between different groups and to determine odds ratios in assessing the predictive value of UI for successful rehabilitation in different patient groups. Indwelling catheters were removed for several hours to determine whether a voiding trial might be effective in eliminating the indwelling catheters. Subjects who could not manage voiding and who developed urinary retention were catheterized. Patients who were able to respond to simple questions regarding toileting were potential candidates for determination of PVR to exclude overflow incontinence. If PVR was more than 100 cc, patients were catheterized. Catheters were removed from the patients who could empty their bladders successfully. The patients who were unable to respond to questions regarding toileting needs were tested for PVR, and if their bladders were emptied successfully (PVR<100 cc), they were not catheterized but were left with diapers on. Successful functional level was defined as a total Functional Independence Measure score greater than 80 at discharge.4 Patients with indwelling catheters and diapers were defined as incontinent. Incidence of PSUI in the study group was 39.3%. Incidence of PSUI in patients with aged 75 and older (55.5%) was significantly higher than it was in patients younger than 75 (P<.01). Evidence of PSUI was a strong negative predictor for stroke rehabilitation outcome in all age groups. The predictivity was highest in patients with aged 65 to 74 and lowest in the youngest patient group (<55). Results of the statistical studies are summarized in Table 1. Many studies have reported that PSUI is the most important negative predictive factor for functional recovery in stroke.5–9 It is most probable that evidence of PSUI is a result and a reason for bad prognosis. It is a fusion of many common negative predictors such as poor cognition, severe cerebral involvement, comorbid diseases attacking the autonomic nervous system, immobilization, and old age. PSUI is also a causative factor for inadequate hygiene, decubitus ulcers, infections, and malnutrition. These are the facts that make PSUI the most significant negative prognostic clinical factor for stroke outcome. Age of 75 and older was another significant factor for the evidence of PSUI, and for this particular age group, functional UI might have complicated the situation and increased the rate up to 55.5%.

Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

      "title": "Depression and Suicide in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Depressive disorders in children and adolescents are common and often disabling. They can interfere with normal growth and development, academic performance, and interpersonal relationships, and they are a significant risk factor for suicide. These disorders fall on a spectrum that ranges from mild symptoms of depressed mood, which might occur in response to an acute stressor, to pervasive sad or irritable mood accompanied by problems with sleep, appetite, social isolation, and sometimes, suicidal ideas, plans, and intent. Prevalence rates for depression range from 1% to 2% of prepubertal children to 3% to 8% of adolescents. Depression in prepubertal children and bipolar disorder in any age group are equally common in both sexes. However, unipolar depressive disorders in adolescents are more common in girls than in boys (ratio of 3:1), and early onset of puberty in girls increases the risk for depression. (1)Depressed children and adolescents manifest a variety of signs and symptoms. They can be sad, irritable, or angry and may present with school or behavioral problems. They can demonstrate somatic complaints (eg, headache, stomachache, muscle weakness), decreased or increased appetite, fatigue, insomnia, hypersomnia, or disturbed sleep-wake cycles. Some children and adolescents develop psychotic features consistent with their mood symptoms, such as paranoid delusions or auditory hallucinations with self-deprecatory content. Some develop self-injurious behaviors or suicidal ideation, plan, and intent. Anxiety symptoms may be present and may predate the development of depressive symptoms. Behavioral problems ranging from oppositional defiance to frank conduct disorder may occur in conjunction with an underlying mood disorder.Depressive disorders vary in degree of severity as well as in intensity and duration of symptoms. Adjustment disorders accompanied by depressed mood can be acute but severe; major depression (with or without psychotic features) can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders are specific and detailed and can be found in the latest American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.Potential risk factors for depression are many, ranging from genetic loading to tumultuous life events. However, it is the interaction between biologic vulnerability and environmental stress that takes center stage. Environmental risk factors include abuse or neglect; parental substance abuse; marital problems; low socioeconomic status and education level; loss of parent, sibling, or close friend; and stress related to adolescent developmental or issues of sexuality (eg, homosexuality). Genetic risk factors seem to play a greater role in adolescent depression than in prepubertal depression, with the most potent risk factor being parental depression. The depressed parent contributes both genetic vulnerability and emotional unavailability that can contribute to family dissension and instability. Newer research suggests that the combination of adverse life events and the presence of the shorter allelic form of the serotonin transporter gene results in early-onset depression. (2)Functional neuroimaging studies in children and adolescents reflect many of the same findings seen in similar studies of adults. The details of such adult studies are beyond the scope of this review, but most have found smaller prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in depressed individuals. Less work has been done in this area with children and adolescents because of the higher risks associated with radiation exposure. Early, preliminary studies suggest that such structural differences may be transmitted genetically and serve as a marker of inherited risk for depression. (3)The nature of the relationship between neuroendocrine changes and depressive disorders in children and adolescents is not well understood. Abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, as detected by the dexamethasone suppression test, may reflect a similar risk for depressive disorders in children and adolescents as for adults. Studies of growth hormone secretion theorize that a blunted response to growth hormone may represent vulnerability for early-onset depression in children and adolescents. Similarly, response patterns of depressed children and nondepressed children who have family histories of affective illness may be associated with an increased risk of depression as well as aggressive and suicidal behavior in children and adolescents. (4)Other risk factors for depressive disorders include certain types of medications (glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives, isotretinoin, antiviral agents) and any chronic illness such as cystic fibrosis, juvenile diabetes, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, sickle cell anemia, organ transplantation, and cancer.Diagnosing depressive disorders in children and adolescents can be difficult because the presentation can vary widely, depending on developmental stage. Furthermore, almost all children experience some sadness at times of stress, and normal adolescence can be a time of intense moodiness, impulsivity, and erratic behavior. Nevertheless, the risk for continued morbidity and impairment of social function makes differentiation of children who demonstrate symptoms consistent with significant depression from those who are transiently upset in response to stressful circumstances very important. Such assessment can be difficult because few reliable tests support the differentiation. The clinical history and mental status examination are most important. Such evaluations can be time-consuming and challenging because children and adolescents may not volunteer information about their mood, feelings, and circumstances unless they are asked specific, detailed questions. Furthermore, even if asked, they may not be able to recognize or describe changes in mood.Pediatricians who evaluate children and adolescents must determine the presence or absence of symptoms of a depressive disorder; the child's current level of functioning relative to his or her baseline; and the potential for self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempt. The evaluation involves obtaining a history from the child as well as from the parent or guardian and other caregivers such as teachers, counselors, or coaches. The family's cultural background can contribute to the child's presentation and must be taken into account.The child may report disturbances in mood, sleep, or appetite or note suicidal thoughts or wishes but may be less likely to comment on changes in peer relationships or school performance. Information about interpersonal interactions should be obtained from collateral sources. Any child affected with a disturbance of mood that is persistent and pervasive and interferes with day-to-day functioning should be assessed for depression. Although some fear that asking children and adolescents questions about their level of psychosocial functioning, their mood, or their risk for self-injury can predispose them to mood disorders or to destructive action, all available evidence suggests the opposite. (5)Assessment of depressive disorders in children must be viewed through the developmental lens. What may be an acute stressor for an elementary school student may have less affective resonance for a middle or high school student and vice versa. A high school freshman will not expect to make the varsity basketball team, whereas a fifth grader might be devastated if relegated to a \"B\" team after tryouts. A chronic illness such as cystic fibrosis may be less difficult for an 8-year-old third grader who still can play video games and go out for recess than for a high school student who cannot keep up with the rapid pace of school, sports, and parties, who feels ostracized and isolated, and who understands the concept of terminal illness. The importance of such stressors can be missed if the clinician does not recognize the potential power of a seemingly minor loss or defeat in the life of a child.Supplementation of the clinical history with self-report questionnaires can be enormously helpful, particularly in the primary care setting. Examples of such instruments include the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), (6) which assesses the severity of depression in prepubertal school-age children, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), (7) Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS-2), (8) and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) (9) for older adolescents. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care (GLAD-PC) Toolkit also has child and parent report measures and scoring instructions on their web site (http://www.thereachinstitute.org/files/documents/GLAD-PCToolkit.pdf). This user-friendly online resource also includes management flowcharts, scales, and educational materials in English and Spanish, as well as tracking forms and information on billing.Comorbid disorders in depressed children and adolescents include anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance abuse, and conduct disorder. Some disorders, such as ADHD, may be transmitted genetically in families; others likely have a bidirectional causality with, for example, substance abuse (alcohol, recreational drugs, tobacco) as both a potential cause and effect of depression.Management of child and adolescent depressive disorders in primary care settings is challenging because of time constraints, the paucity of formal clinical guidelines, and lack of access to mental health professionals. Nevertheless, given the morbidity and potential mortality associated with depression in children and adolescents, pediatricians have a responsibility to learn to identify children at risk and ensure appropriate evaluation either by themselves or with consultation or referral.For children and adolescents who have mild depressive symptoms, supportive counseling, problem-solving discussions, and education of family members may suffice. However, for more severe symptoms, other interventions may be necessary. Approaches for treatment of moderate and severe depression include the prescribing of medication, either alone or with other interpersonal therapies. Three types of treatments are validated empirically: 1) psychopharmacologic intervention, specifically selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), either alone or in combination with psychotherapy; 2) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and 3) interpersonal therapy (IPT).Antidepressant medications, specifically the SSRIs, have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression in adults, children, and adolescents. Currently, fluoxetine is the only antidepressant approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of children and adolescents, although research studies have demonstrated efficacy of other drugs such as citalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline. The 2006 FDA meta-analysis of children and adolescents taking SSRIs for the treatment of depression found an increased risk of suicidality in those patients treated with drugs versus those given placebo. Subsequent meta-analysis, using additional studies not included in the FDA report, revealed that those who benefited from SSRI treatment outnumbered those who became suicidal during SSRI treatment by a ratio of 14:1. Some suggest that the temporal relationship between the decrease in prescribing practices after implementation of the FDA black box warning and the recent increase in adolescent suicide attempts provides evidence that SSRI treatment of depression can be lifesaving. (10)Because the most evidence for efficacy and safety exists for fluoxetine, many suggest that it should be the first choice for medication management of depressive symptoms. The success of treatment can be reassessed after a 6- to 8-week trial, unless adverse effects or a worsening clinical picture dictate earlier intervention. Common adverse effects from fluoxetine include nausea and vomiting, sleep disturbance with vivid dreams, and agitation. Dosage can start as low as 2.5 mg/day for prepubertal children and 10 mg/day for older adolescents, with increases based on clinical response at 2-week intervals according to the pharmacokinetic profile of the medication. Most patients respond to fluoxetine at doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg/day.For vulnerable patients, any antidepressant can precipitate agitation and secondary mania and, therefore, should be used with caution. The FDA suggests careful monitoring of medication response, with weekly face-to-face meetings between caregiver and patient or patient's family for the first month, although no evidence supports such management, and it is likely that weekly consultation by phone could be sufficient. The interval between visits can be lengthened to biweekly for the next 4 weeks and subsequently reduced further, based on the clinical situation. Consideration of a trial of other antidepressants in children and adolescents, either SSRIs or other classes, should prompt consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist prior to initiation. Studies regarding clinical efficacy and response of childhood depression to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants and the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine have been inconclusive.Most unipolar, untreated depressive disorders in children and adolescents last between 3 and 12 months. The risk of recurrence ranges from 34% to 50% within the first year after discontinuation of treatment; 50% to 75% of affected children have a relapse within 8 years following the initial episode. (11) Comorbid disorders such as anxiety or substance abuse, presence of suicidal ideation, recurrent episodes of parental depression, and family chaos predispose to a longer duration of active symptoms.Depression in children and adolescents should be conceptualized as a chronic illness. Clinicians should treat the acute episode until the patient's symptoms are in remission. Additional treatment should focus on prevention. In general, if the symptoms have not improved or remitted after a 6- to 8-week trial on medication or if the patient has developed intolerable adverse effects, the clinician should change medication. If the response to treatment has been partial, the clinician might consider increasing the dose of the current medication, adding another agent, or suggesting other types of therapy. Of note, treatment failure in adolescents might be due to noncompliance rather than refractory symptoms. If the patient's depression has gone into remission, therapy to prevent recurrence should continue for another 6 to 9 months. More than 90% of children and adolescent outpatients who have depressive disorder recover within 1 to 2 years. Because no data are available on the long-term effects of medication on children or adolescents, it is difficult to justify indefinite continuation of treatment. However, given the risks for recurrence and relapse, it is prudent to monitor children and adolescents closely, even after treatment.CBT is the best studied nonpharmacologic intervention for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. The theoretical underpinning of this therapy postulates that depressed children and adolescents have distortions in their thought processes that cause them to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects of any given situation. Stressful events serve to accentuate the negative ideation and precipitate depressive episodes, which then may cause counterproductive or maladaptive behaviors. A common therapeutic format includes: psychoeducation; behavioral modification involving active scheduling of enjoyable activities; cognitive restructuring to reframe distortions and allow for new, more rational thoughts; and learning self-relaxation techniques. Most studies of CBT have suggested that it is an extremely effective intervention for depressive disorders in children and adolescents.The Treatment for Adolescent Depression Study (TADS), published in 2004, evaluated fluoxetine, CBT, and the combination of the two in terms of relative efficacy in the treatment of adolescent depression versus placebo. (12) In this well-powered study, fluoxetine and CBT together and fluoxetine alone were superior to CBT alone and to placebo. CBT alone failed to demonstrate the same efficacy found in earlier studies, perhaps because the patients in TADS were extremely ill and presented with more comorbid conditions. It also is possible that the CBT treatment package used in TADS employed too many different techniques to allow any one technique enough time to succeed.IPT centers on the problems in the patient's interpersonal interactions, seeking to change conflicted, hostile relationships into supportive, meaningful, and satisfying ones. The focus of the therapy usually is on development of social skills and investigation of the effect of shifting roles within family or peer groups, including adjustment to such events as parental divorce or remarriage. In IPT, the patient looks at his or her place within a larger social context. In contrast, CBT focuses on the patient's internal thought processes and how they influence perspective and behavioral patterns.Any one of the three previously noted approaches is a reasonable first choice in the treatment of children and adolescents whose symptoms are moderate. Medication likely is the best choice for those who have more severe symptoms, coupled with CBT or supportive counseling, depending on available resources. Evidence suggests that the relationship and degree of trust between child and therapist is a good predictor of the efficacy of therapy. Children and adolescents who fail to respond to initial interventions within 6 to 8 weeks and those who have very severe mood disorders and accompanying significant impairment in psychosocial functioning or suicidal ideation, plan, or intent should be referred to a child psychiatrist or mental health specialist, if possible (Table 1). Most children and adolescents who have depressive disorders can be managed as outpatients. However, those who are actively suicidal, homicidal, or psychotic should be hospitalized.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (13) suicide is the third leading cause of death in the United States among adolescents and young adults ages 10 to 24 years. From 1990 to 2003, suicide rates in that age group declined from 9.48 to 6.78 per 100,000. However, from 2003 to 2004 (the most recent year for which data are available), the rate increased to 7.32 per 100,000. This increase reflects upward trends in three groups: females ages 10 to 14 years and 15 to 19 years and males ages 15 to 19 years. Hanging/suffocation was the most common cause of death in females in all age groups and firearms the most common method used by males. There are ethnic disparities within these age groups: Native American/Alaskan Native youth and Hispanic females have a higher percentage of suicide attempts than their peers. Few prepubertal children successfully commit suicide (suicide rate 0.6 per 100,000 for ages 5 to 14 years), but these children are at high risk for suicide attempts in their adolescence and young adulthood.Suicidal ideation and gestures also are increasing in frequency. Although there is no national registry for such behaviors, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, 2005, a survey of high school students across the United States, reveal that 16.9% considered suicide and 8.4% had attempted suicide within the past year. Both mood and anxiety disorders increase the likelihood of suicidal ideation. In prepubertal children, suicidal ideation can be associated with disruptive disorders. In adolescents, substance abuse and separation anxiety may predispose to such ideation.These statistics are sobering and argue for vigorous efforts at early identification of children and adolescents at risk as well as aggressive prevention and intervention. One instrument used to screen adolescents for psychiatric illness is the Teen-Screen, a school-based program that screened 55,000 students in 2005. The screening has two parts: a self-report questionnaire and an open-ended interview by a skilled mental health professional. The combination of the questionnaire and interview ensures that a positive result on the self-report also is reflected in the clinical history. The program is voluntary but requires consent of the student's parent or guardian. If the student's questionnaire and interview suggest the presence of psychiatric illness, he or she is referred for additional psychiatric evaluation. The Teen-Screen is controversial because many feel that it violates parental rights and that the high false-positive rate invalidates the testing. Although the \"screen\" has a high sensitivity but low specificity, the risk of overlooking a truly suicidal adolescent seems greater than the risk of misdiagnosing (and potentially stigmatizing) a normal teenager.About 70% of adolescents are seen by their primary care physicians at least once a year. The same percentage reports a willingness to talk with their primary care physicians about their mental health. Pediatricians must be trained to detect psychiatric illness that may predispose their patients to self-injurious behaviors. They also must be alert to the risk factors for suicide in children and adolescents: mood disorder, substance abuse, loss of a loved one, family discord, social isolation, family history of suicidal behavior, previous suicide attempt, and availability of firearms.Any child experiencing a mood disorder or substance abuse should be considered at risk for suicide and evaluated thoroughly. Questions to ask might include those listed in Table 2. If a child or adolescent is actively suicidal, with plan or intent or both, the clinician should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the safety of the child.Suicidal \"gestures,\" such as superficial cutting or ingestion of a few extra pills, must be taken seriously. Any episode of self-inflicted harm may be a sign of attempted suicide. A child or adolescent might believe that the \"gesture\" could have caused death or he or she might believe that an overdose of, for example, acetaminophen is safe because it is a drug that can be bought easily at the drugstore. It also is important to review with the child or adolescent what \"death\" or \"killing oneself\" means. A child younger than 6 years of age might be unable to appreciate the finality of death.No evidence suggests that \"no suicide contracts\" (in which the patient agrees not to harm him- or herself and lists ways to help him- or herself should suicidal feelings arise) are preventive. If the child or adolescent is actively suicidal, it is unlikely that he or she is in any position to understand the contract or to agree to it. Furthermore, once such a contract is signed, parents or guardians charged with helping the child to stay safe might become less vigilant.For a child or adolescent who has attempted suicide, it is helpful to assess the risk/rescue ratio. This practice assesses the risk of the action in relation to the likelihood of rescue. The child who overdoses on a medication late at night, tells no one, and goes to sleep hoping never to wake up is different from the child who takes a handful of pills while standing in the kitchen arguing with a parent.In most cases, the legal guardians (parents or other caregivers) must be informed of the results of the assessment; issues of confidentiality become moot in the setting of active suicidal (or homicidal) ideation with intent and plan. Questions regarding availability of and access to firearms and other vectors of harm (including knives, drugs, and poisons) must be discussed, with the goal of removing access to these items in the home or any place where the child or adolescent might go. Usually, it is necessary to hospitalize actively suicidal children and adolescents on psychiatric inpatient units for their immediate safety as well as for containment, stabilization, psychopharmacologic evaluation, and ultimate referral to an outpatient network of care.One of the most frightening aspects of adolescent suicides is the potential for contagion and cluster formation. Perspectives differ on what constitutes a \"cluster,\" but for the purposes of this article, it is defined as three or more suicides occurring within the same community that bear a temporal relationship to one another. The etiology of cluster formation is controversial. One theory looks at suicide as an infectious disease, as if the impetus to kill oneself is contagious. Another suggests that vulnerable adolescents, particularly those who are depressed, become suicidal in the face of intense loss. Cluster formation can pose a true public health dilemma because too much media coverage (television, Internet) can contribute to the contagious or imitative risk. However, that risk must be balanced with the need for information to be distributed throughout the community as an aid in the process of recovery and healing.",

      "title": "A Case Study of Acute Stimulant-induced Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis resulting from stimulant overuse is commonly observed in clinical practices today. This is in large part due to the significant increase in attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) diagnoses in recent years, the increase in methamphetamine trafficking, and the prevalence of stimulant use in the day-to-day activities by many of those living in today's fast-paced society. The current inability to predict those users who will experience stimulant-induced psychosis from those users who will not needs further investigation. In this case study, we examine why one particular stimulant user experiences stimulant-induced psychosis. We give an account of a patient with an acute psychotic episode admitted to the emergency room at a local hospital. During initial evaluation, it was discovered that he had been diagnosed with ADHD one month ago and that the onset of his symptoms was likely related to an overuse of amphetamines. The patient had no personal history or family history of any psychiatric or mood disorders. He had no history of recreational drug use prior to this incident, and had no history of seizures or head trauma. After appropriate pharmacological intervention with antipsychotics and psychological intervention, the patient showed gradual improvement over the next five days of his hospitalization. After the five days, he was allowed to be discharged. We conclude with the cautionary advice that a patient's susceptibility of experiencing stimulant-induced psychosis should be assessed before prescribing stimulants. In cases where stimulant use is not supervised by a physician, appropriate understanding of management of stimulant-induced psychosis is of utmost importance in order to provide the very best patient education and care.",

      "title": "Evaluating Adolescents With Fatigue",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Unexplained fatigue in adolescents is a common and frustrating complaint that can pose a challenge for even the most experienced physicians. Although the cause usually is benign and self-limited, occasionally there is a serious underlying disorder. This symptom cannot be dismissed without performing a thorough medical history, detailed psychosocial profile, and careful physical examination. Selective use of laboratory and radiologic studies should be considered when specifically indicated. If the cause remains unclear, sequential visits often provide clues for the practitioner and reassurance for the family. The purpose of this article is to offer guidelines to the clinician caring for adolescents who have prolonged, unexplained fatigue and to stress the value of a thorough history and physical examination.For purposes of this discussion, fatigue will be defined as abnormal exhaustion after usual activities. An arbitrary cutoff of 1 month is used to distinguish acute from chronic fatigue. The term chronic fatigue syndrome is avoided because criteria for this condition are not clearly established in children or adolescents, and data must be extrapolated from studies in adults. The term neurally mediated hypotension is used to describe a fall in blood pressure in response to assuming the upright posture, physical events, and emotional stressors. Affected patients may be syncopal or presyncopal. Neurally mediated hypotension also is referred to in the literature as neurocardiogenic syncope, vasovagal reflex, vasodepressor syncope, and autonomic dysfunction.The best way to approach a problem of this nature is to establish a good relationship with adolescents and their parents so they will trust your recommendations and not pressure you into unnecessary tests or referrals. The examination begins when the family enters the office by greeting the patient first to establish a direct relationship immediately. It is worthwhile to obtain the history while the patient is fully clothed because adolescents usually feel more relaxed under these circumstances. Initially, the patient and parents are interviewed together, assuring both parties that there will be adequate time later to speak with the examiner alone. While taking the history, the clinician should demonstrate a willingness to listen and be particularly alert for any clues of a hidden agenda or an underlying illness.More sensitive issues are discussed with the patient alone. Every effort must be made to assure privacy and confidentiality when obtaining personal information from adolescents. Credit must be give to Cohen, who has refined a method for organizing the psychosocial history that was developed by Berman in 1972. This system has been expanded and modified further at the SUNY Upstate Medical University Adolescent Medicine Center in Syracuse. The questions are structured in an easily remembered format that stresses the importance of connecting with adolescents HEADS FIRST (Table 1). This approach emphasizes that “getting into adolescent heads” is just as necessary as performing a physical examination. In many instances, the information obtained during the psychosocial interview is key to elucidating the cause of unexplained fatigue in teenagers.The issues outlined in Table 1 can be addressed with the traditional verbal approach, using the suggested cue words, or by having the patient complete a self-administered personal questionnaire. With either method, the questions should be answered privately and reviewed confidentially with the examiner unless the patient specifically requests otherwise. Most parents respect their adolescents’ need for privacy and appreciate the opportunity for them to receive one-on-one counseling with an experienced health professional.There is considerable overlap in the signs and symptoms caused by the various underlying conditions associated with fatigue. Manifestations are often subtle and should be correlated closely with the overall clinical picture. Thus, clinicians must have a high index of awareness when interpreting historical data, physical findings, and other pertinent information in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue.The onset, severity, and duration of the fatigue as well as any aggravating or relieving factors are explored when taking the history. Particular attention should be paid to any significant changes in the patient’s physical activity level, exercise tolerance, and ability to keep up with peers. Lack of sleep due to getting to bed later, difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakening, or getting up earlier in the morning should be considered. A careful review of systems is also essential, with close attention to any constitutional symptoms, such as unexplained fevers, chills, sweating, anorexia, weight loss, or lymphadenopathy, which may suggest the presence of an underlying infection, malignancy, or other inflammatory process. A history of an antecedent “mono-like” illness with negative diagnostic studies is relatively common and suggestive of an infectious cause. However, the significance of this association is unknown.Recent weight gain as well as weight loss should alert the clinician to the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or underlying medical condition. Teenagers who have eating disorders often resort to desperate, even dangerous measures to improve their self-esteem or to enhance their image. Attempts at weight reduction often involve self-injurious behaviors, such as severe caloric deprivation, excessive exercise, self-induced vomiting, and the use of appetite suppressants, laxatives, diuretics, or emetics. Fatigue from rapid fluid shifts or hypokalemia is especially common among bulimics, whose weight may fluctuate dramatically as a result of the frequent episodes of binging and purging. In contrast, patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa usually seem to have boundless energy, even in a state of severe emaciation.Adolescents who engage in competitive activities in which thinness or “making weight” are judged important to success are believed to be particularly susceptible to unhealthy weight control practices. Such activities include body building, cheerleading, dancing (especially ballet), distance running, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, horse racing, modeling, rowing, swimming, weight-class football, and wrestling. As the preoccupation with thinness supersedes the desire to be healthy, physically active young women are at risk for a group of signs and symptoms known as the female athlete triad. Lack of information and the strong desire to win contribute to this condition, which consists of abnormal eating patterns, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. In many instances, these girls become less competitive as they begin to tire more easily and have less stamina.Adolescents should be screened for stress, anxiety, and depression, which frequently are associated with fatigue in this age group. The three most common sources of conflict are problems at home, strained peer relationships, and school-related difficulties. Having a job or not having a job for those in financial need may be an added source of pressure. The practitioner also should look for feelings of sadness, changes in behavior, difficulty concentrating, declining school performance, and other symptoms of depression. Most teens respond openly when asked if they get upset or depressed easily and if they have ever felt like hurting themselves or someone else. Any positive responses can be pursued by asking the patient to “tell me about this.” It must be stressed that adolescents who are actively suicidal or homicidal require immediate intervention by mental health experts, legal authorities, or both.Recent exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus as well as to other contagious diseases such as hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis should be determined. Asking about pets, tick bites, recent travel, and water supply sometimes is fruitful. A search also should be made for symptoms of cardiac disorders, pulmonary conditions, endocrinopathies, gastrointestinal problems, and renal abnormalities. The menstrual history should be obtained from adolescent girls, looking for amenorrhea, irregular periods, or excessive bleeding, which may suggest the possibility of an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous miscarriage, recent termination, or threatened abortion. In addition, the patients should be asked about the use of any over-the-counter or prescribed medications that have a known sedative effect.The clinician also should inquire about symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension, a condition that has been associated with unexplained fatigue in adolescents. Neurally mediated hypotension leads to symptoms after prolonged periods of upright posture, standing in place, standing in the shower, and even sitting. It is especially common when the patient is in a warm environment and after emotionally stressful events. In addition, it may be seen immediately after exercise or soon after eating in some patients as blood flow is shifted to the intestines during the process of digestion.Common symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension include recurrent light-headedness and fainting, which often are associated with postexertional fatigue for 24 to 72 hours. Of particular note, persistent fatigue is a prominent feature of this condition in many adolescents, even if there is no history of fainting. In addition, headaches, myalgias, and mental confusion may occur. The latter frequently is described by patients as being in a “mental fog,” with difficulty concentrating, trouble paying attention, having a hard time staying on task, and having problems finding the right words. Occasionally, shortness of breath with or without chest pain may occur.Any history of recurrent or persistent fever should be documented in the clinician’s office. Unexplained temperature elevation suggests the presence of an underlying infection, neoplasm, or other inflammatory process such as Crohn disease. Hypothermia occurs frequently in patients who have experienced rapid or excessive weight loss. This finding is especially common among adolescents who have eating disorders in whom the low body temperature helps to conserve energy to help compensate for losses from severe caloric deprivation or purging. In addition, hypothyroidism always should be suspected in teenagers who are fatigued, whose temperatures tend to run below normal, and who gain weight in spite of what appear to be appropriate restrictions in dietary intake.Anxiety and stress are the most common causes of tachycardia in the practitioner’s office. They also are important sources of fatigue in adolescents, especially in patients who are not sleeping well. Marijuana is another frequent cause of tachycardia and should be considered in teenagers who appear to be excessively tired or poorly motivated. Stimulant drugs that have been prescribed, purchased over-the-counter, or taken illegally may cause an accelerated heart rate. Fatigue is relatively common when the effects of these drugs begin to wear off. Endocrine abnormalities, including Addison disease, diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism, as well as a number of pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions may cause an elevated pulse rate in patients who are fatigued.Significant weight loss from voluntary caloric restriction is characteristically accompanied by sinus bradycardia, especially in patients who are hypothermic. This is an important physical finding that may help to distinguish adolescents who have eating disorders or those who are simply getting in shape from those who have an underlying organic cause for their weight loss. On the other hand, unexplained weight gain in patients who have bradycardia and fatigue should raise the suspicion of hypothyroidism. A slow pulse rate also may be caused by various medications or street drugs that have a known sedative effect.Abnormalities in the respiratory rate in association with fatigue may indicate a cardiac, pulmonary, or metabolic disorder. Variations in the breathing pattern also may be seen with the use, abuse, or withdrawal of many prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or street drugs.As with tachycardia, anxiety and stress are the most common causes of hypertension identified in the examination room. However, the finding of elevated blood pressure in association with fatigue may be due to several important medical conditions, including connective tissue disorders, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, hyperthyroidism, and renal abnormalities. Routine use, abuse, or withdrawal of over-the-counter drugs, prescription medications, or illicit psychoactive substances also may cause hypertension and fatigue.Delayed orthostatic hypotension after prolonged standing also has been described in patients who have unexplained fatigue (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Hypotension also may be noted as an adverse effect of various medications or in relation to abuse of street drugs. Adolescents who have Addison disease are especially susceptible to dehydration with hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, particularly during periods of physical stress. Addison disease always should be suspected in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially when there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss.It is very important to plot height routinely throughout the adolescent years. Failure of a patient to progress along the expected parameters should draw immediate attention to the possibility of an underlying systemic process affecting growth and causing unexplained fatigue. In contrast, a normal linear growth velocity all but excludes the presence of an underlying endocrinopathy, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing syndrome, which may cause fatigue in association with obesity. A normal linear growth velocity also lessens the possibility of chronic cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or renal disorders in teenagers who are excessively tired.It is also very important to plot weight throughout adolescence. Patients who have excessive weight gain or loss should be evaluated carefully for the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or medical condition. Poor weight gain over time also may be a subtle manifestation of a serious underlying illness, such as inflammatory bowel disease, especially in adolescents who have an unexplained low energy level.The examiner’s first impression about the patient’s overall well-being can be very insightful. Does the patient look ill or well? Does the patient seem to be depressed, anxious, or stressed? Does the patient seem to be adequately nourished?The skin may serve as a window to underlying systemic causes of fatigue in adolescents. Jaundice suggests the presence of hepatitis or hemolysis. A yellow cast to the skin due to hypercarotenemia may be seen in patients who have anorexia nervosa and ingest large amounts of yellow-orange fruits and vegetables. This is a benign physical finding that resembles icterus, but the sclera are not involved. It should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of an eating disorder that may be otherwise unrecognized.Cyanosis may indicate the presence of a significant abnormality in the cardiovascular or pulmonary system, especially when digital clubbing also is present. The findings may be extremely subtle and only detectable by meticulous examination. A patient of mine had a somewhat sallow appearance. He was tired all the time, but was otherwise totally asymptomatic. During the consultation, he had bounding pulses that eventually led to the diagnosis of a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation as the cause of symptoms.Pallor usually is associated with iron deficiency anemia resulting from inadequate dietary intake, rapid growth, or blood loss. The latter is especially common in adolescent girls who are having heavy menstrual periods. However, many other important causes of anemia must be considered in this age group, including chronic inflammation, hemolysis, malignancy, and vitamin B12 deficiency, the latter especially in those who are on a vegan diet. Fatigue is a relatively late manifestation of anemia and usually is noted only in moderate-to-severe anemia that has developed over time. Pallor also may be a sign of anxiety, abuse of psychoactive drugs, and the allergic tension fatigue syndrome.Generalized hyperpigmentation may be seen in patients who have fatigue associated with Addison disease. A clue to this diagnosis is involvement of the unexposed areas of skin as well as accentuation of the hyperpigmentation over the axillae, nipples, umbilicus, genitalia, or extensor surfaces of the joints. The clinician also should look carefully at the dorsum of the hands for evidence of superficial ulcerations, calluses, or scars in patients who have bulimia. This is known as Russell sign and is caused by using the fingers to induce vomiting in an effort to control weight. Many patients who have bulimia suffer from fatigue because of fluid or electrolyte imbalance as well as associated depression. Other signs of self-mutilation, such as cuts, scars, scratches, burns, and carved-out tatoos, may be seen in patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem.A number of skin findings may provide insight into the presence of an underlying connective tissue disease, infectious process, or other inflammatory condition that could cause fatigue in adolescents. A butterfly or discoid rash and photosensitivity are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Flushed cheeks followed by the appearance of a lacy, reticulated rash over the trunk and extremities are found in Fifth disease, which may cause persistent fatigue in teenagers. An evanescent, salmon-colored rash that has irregular borders or serpiginous margins is seen in patients who have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and frequently is accompanied by fever. Subcutaneous nodules also may occur with this condition and are located near the olecranon process, on the dorsal aspect of the hands or knees, near the ears, and over pressure areas such as the scapulae, sacrum, buttocks, and heels. These nodules are usually nontender. In contrast, erythema nodosum is characterized by exquisitely tender, erythematous nodular lesions over the extensor surfaces of the extremities, especially on the pretibial surface of the legs. These lesions frequently recur and are associated with many inflammatory disorders that cause fatigue.Raynaud phenomenon, with characteristic color changes of the fingers and toes, should raise suspicion of a connective tissue disease or other underlying cause. Nailbed capillary changes with dilation and tortuosity of the vessels may be a very subtle finding in patients who have collagen vascular diseases. Cutaneous sclerosis, especially of the digits and face, is associated with scleroderma. In addition, an erythematous, purplish discoloration of the eyelids, forehead, cheeks, temples, dorsal interphalangeal joints, and extensor surfaces of the extremities suggests dermatomyositis.The presence of “allergic shiners” or a bluish discoloration under the eyes often is seen with sinusitis as well as with the allergic tension fatigue syndrome. Injection of the bulbar conjunctivae is common among those who use marijuana. Sjögren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder of unknown cause characterized by dry eyes, xerostomia, salivary gland enlargement, and a high incidence of connective tissue disease. Evidence of iritis or uveitis suggests the presence of a connective tissue disorder or other underlying inflammatory process, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Several oral findings have been noted in patients who have eating disorders, including enamel erosion or caries, particularly over the inner aspect of the upper teeth. This finding probably is related to repeated exposure to gastric contents following self-induced vomiting. Swelling of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands also has been described in those who have bulimia. Enlargement of the submandibular glands may be especially difficult to distinguish from lymphadenopathy in the anterior cervical region. In most instances, the salivary tissue has a softer consistency than the enlarged nodes, but there may be considerable overlap. Infection or other causes of inflammation in the salivary glands also may be associated with fatigue.Evidence of stomatitis, gingivitis, or glossitis in teenagers who are excessively tired may indicate an underlying systemic process. Recurrent mouth ulcers, especially if they are unusually severe or recalcitrant to therapy, are relatively common in Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Behçet syndrome is a rare multisystem vasculitis characterized by the triad of recurrent oral ulcers, iridocyclitis, and recurrent ulcers of the external genitalia as well as a variety of other findings that may be accompanied by fatigue. In addition, hyperpigmentation of the gums is seen with Addison disease.The adolescent’s strength should be assessed to differentiate conditions that are associated with muscular weakness from other causes of fatigue. Muscular dystrophy always must be considered. Patients who have myasthenia gravis often experience weakness only late in the day or after physical activity. The clinician should search for other signs of myasthenia gravis that sometimes are subtle, including evidence of ptosis, weakness of the extraocular muscles, and dysphagia. The diminished strength noted in dermatomyositis may be generalized, but it is predominantly proximal, with involvement of the limb girdles and anterior flexors.Objective evidence of arthritis strongly supports an organic cause for the fatigue, such as connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, infection, or neoplasm. Localized bone pain or tenderness to direct palpation may be associated with anatomic lesions, both benign and malignant. Unexplained bone pain that awakens the patient at night is especially concerning for leukemia or similar invasive processes. Clubbing of the fingers or toes suggests the possibility of chronic pulmonary, cardiac, or liver disease.A careful neurologic examination should be performed to help exclude rare causes of fatigue in adolescents, such as multiple sclerosis. The Chiari malformation also may be associated with subtle neurologic signs in association with fatigue. I recently had a patient in whom the cerebellar tonsils protruded into the spinal canal and compressed the nerves innervating the palate. The floppy palatal tissue resulted in obstructive sleep apnea, and the patient awakened unrefreshed in the morning. The family sought medical attention after the teachers complained that the girl had been falling asleep in class. A decompression procedure was performed by neurosurgery, and the girl’s fatigue resolved completely.Facial tenderness suggests the presence of sinusitis, although this finding often is absent in this condition. Persistent lymphadenopathy may be seen with infection, malignancy, connective tissue disease, or other inflammatory processes. The thyroid gland should be palpated for any enlargement or nodules. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism may be associated with fatigue. The lungs, heart, and abdomen should be assessed carefully for any abnormalities that may provide a clue to the diagnosis. The costovertebral angles should be palpated for any tenderness that may suggest pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, or other renal abnormality. In addition, patients who have generalized ligamentous laxity frequently experience vague musculoskeletal pain and are tired, especially late in the day. Finally, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered in adolescent girls and a pelvic examination performed when indicated.The differential diagnosis of fatigue is extensive and includes numerous organic disorders as well as many psychosocial-medical conditions (Table 2). Sometimes a combination of factors contributes to the fatigue, especially when it is unduly prolonged. It is relatively common for an initial medical illness to take on features of a psychiatric condition as the process evolves. Psychologic issues may emerge as the primary agenda or develop as a consequence of an organic illness. A psychiatric diagnosis should not be assigned solely by the process of exclusion; the appropriate diagnostic criteria must be met before such a diagnosis is made.Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression may be especially difficult to sort out in adolescents who are fatigued. Failure to attend school may compound an already difficult situation by perpetuating progressive absenteeism. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility that masked school avoidance may be contributing to the fatigue. The hyperventilation syndrome may present with fatigue in association with difficulty breathing, chest pain, lightheadedness, headaches, abdominal pain, and numbness or tingling of the extremities. In addition, fatigue may be a sign of certain eating disorders, especially bulimia and obesity, which frequently are accompanied by poor self-esteem, feelings of guilt, and depression. Patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa typically do not tire easily unless they are moribund or the weight loss has been rapid.Clinicians always should consider the possibility of Addison disease in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially if there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. There usually is generalized hyperpigmentation with involvement of unexposed surfaces as well as accentuation in areas of predilection, as described earlier. Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia are useful diagnostic features, but are not always present. The most definitive diagnostic test is the ACTH stimulation test (described later). It is imperative to consider Addison disease in the differential diagnosis because if it is not recognized and treated, an adrenal crisis may supervene.Many adolescents who have unexplained fatigue begin with a “mono-like” illness that never resolves completely, and all diagnostic testing results are negative. As with acute infectious mononucleosis, these patients often have a history of severe sore throat, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, headaches, nausea, myalgia, and arthralgia with or without evidence of arthritis. Many of the symptoms recur or linger for months in association with the fatigue. In addition, whenever a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is being entertained, the clinician should consider the possibility of infection with Toxoplasma gondii or cytomegalovirus, which may cause similar symptoms.The association between orthostatic blood pressure changes and prolonged fatigue was described by Streeten and Anderson in 1992, who studied seven patients who had lightheadedness, fatigue, “weakness,” and sometimes syncope. Blood pressures were measured every minute with an automated oscillometer while the patients remained standing. There was no fall in blood pressure after standing for a few minutes, which is the endpoint in traditional testing. However, there was a severe fall in blood pressure in all patients after they stood for 13 to 30 minutes, often with syncope or presyncope. Rowe and associates later described four adolescents who had a history of fatigue and underwent tilt-table testing. This procedure induced significant hypotension in all after they were tilted upright for 12 to 23 minutes. Their fatigue improved dramatically after they were treated for orthostatic hypotension.It is not known why patients who have prolonged fatigue develop these cardiovascular changes when they assume the upright posture. When normal individuals stand up, blood pools in the legs, catecholamines increase to compensate for the decreased venous return to the heart, and there is a compensatory increase in heart rate that involves more vigorous contractions. The reduced amount of blood flow to the heart is pumped more efficiently to the vital organs, especially the brain. In contrast, when individuals who have neurally mediated hypotension stand up, there appears to be a “miscommunication” between the heart and the brain. The heart rate slows while the vessels in the arms and legs dilate. As a result, even more blood is taken from the brain, and the patients feel faint. Finally, an abnormal increase in heart rate after prolonged standing has been described in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue. This condition is known as delayed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and it may occur with or without hypotension.In many instances, no diagnostic studies are required after a thorough history and careful physical examination. The costs of investigative studies are high, and any unnecessary testing should be avoided unless specifically indicated. However, if the diagnosis remains uncertain, the clinician should consider a screening evaluation that includes the baseline tests shown in Table 3.The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum electrolytes, liver profile, and urinalysis allow rapid assessment of target organ status in response to a systemic illness. Rheumatologic studies help exclude systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases that may present with fatigue. Thyroid studies always should be performed because manifestations of thyroid conditions often are subtle early in the course of the illness. A high morning cortisol level goes against a diagnosis of Addison disease, but the ACTH stimulation test is the definitive test to exclude this condition. In normal individuals, the serum cortisol level increases two- to three-fold 1 hour after intravenous administration of a synthetic ACTH prepa",

      "abstract": "A 29-year-old man was admitted because of sudden onset of retrograde amnesia. The patient was unable to recall events having occurred during the past 2 years. The impairment was especially serious with regard to personal memories during the 5 months prior to admission, while he had first been working as a full-time employee under stressful circumstance. A diagnosis of dissociative amnesia was made on the basis of absence of any systemic or neurological diseases that could cause amnesia, the inadaptable character of the patient, the nature of amnesia, and presence of stressful condition possibly related to the amnesia. Visual event-related potential (ERP) studies recorded with human face discrimination tasks demonstrated a P3a wave in response to a face of his superior in the office, whom he said that he had never seen before. The similar P3a wave was observed in response to a face quite familiar to the patient, his mother, but not to a face truly unknown to him. These findings suggest that the visual memory of his superior's face exists in the brain, but the patient is unable to retrieve it by some psychogenic mechanism. 131I-IMP SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the left medial temporal lobe and the basal forebrain, suggesting the association between dissociative amnesia and focal brain dysfunction. While dissociative amnesia has been understood as psychogenic nature, both ERPs and SPECT are quite important tools to understand the association between the psychological phenomenon and biological changes of the brain in this disorder.",

We do not fully understand what causes cluster headaches and there are several theories out there. Considered at this point an incurable deep brain neurological pain syndrome, however research has been seriously lacking throughout it’s history and with more research will ultimately give us a much better understanding of the condition. The hypothalamus and activation of it’s surface gray matter is part of this and CH is a circadian disorder and the circadian body clock is the hypothalamus also involving the sphenopalatine ganglion. CH is repetitive and when attacks come normally if episodic CH vs being triggered, attacks can happen at the exact same time every day, night or day, however night time attacks seem to be more common with the disorder. Attack cycles starting at the same time every year or every few years also possibly more than one attack cycle per year is not uncommon with varying cycle lengths lasting commonly weeks to months. The chronic form of the disorder with 2 to 8 or more attacks daily and or nightly lasting a full year with no more than 30 days of relief is the precise definition. The pain is located on one side of the head behind, in or around one of the eyes effecting the temple and head on that same side as well as severe neck pain and stiffness in the shoulders also painful. The intense violent stabbing pain will last between 15 minutes to 3 hours and may be accompanied by redness of the eye with excessive tearing, nasal congestion or runny nose, swelling of the eyelid, forehead or facial sweating, severe restlessness, agitation and some case sensitivity to light.

      "title": "Venlafaxina en el tratamiento de la fobia social",
      "abstract": "RET, Revista de Toxicomanias. No. 13 – 1997 La fobia social, uno de los trastornos de ansiedad definidos en el DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association [APA] 1994); es comun entre la poblacion general. El trastorno se caracteriza por el miedo a hacer alguna cosa o actuar de manera que pueda resultar embarazosa o a ser juzgado o evaluado por los demas. Entre las situaciones fobicas comunes se incluye hablar en publico, comer frente a otros, firmar, ser presentado a extranos o utilizar urinarios publicos. Los episodios de ansiedad pueden ser similares a las crisis de angustia, y muchos de los sujetos evitan las situaciones que les generan ansiedad. Los datos de prevalencia de la fobia social sugieren una prevalencia a lo largo de la vida desde el 3 5% (Schneier y col. 1992b) hasta el 11-15% (Kessler y col. 1994). Estos datos muestran que la fobia social compite en frecuencia con los problemas mas comunmente tratados en el entorno psiquiatrico. El pico de edad de inicio se situa en la adolescencia y primera juventud. Las personas con fobia social se ven afectadas significativamente por varios factores familiares, sociales y ocupacionales particularmente a esa edad, pero tambien a lo largo de la vida adulta. La fobia social (Schneier y col. 1992b) puede ir asociada a comorbilidad significativa, como un aumento de la depresion o el consumo de alcohol o drogas y una disminucion de la calidad de vida. La fobia social responde a varios tratamientos farmacologicos, incluyendo los inhibidores de la monoamino oxidasa (IMAOs) (Liebowitz y col. 1986; Versiani y col. 1992), las benzodiacepinas (Davidson y col. 1991; Ontiveros y Fontaine 1990), y los ISRSs (Black y col. 1992; Schneier y col. 1992b, Sternbach 1990), asi como a la terapia cognitivo-conductual (Marks 1985). De los tratamientos farmacologicos, los IMAOs fenelzina y moclobemida son los que mas se han estudiado (Liebowith y col. 1986; Versiani y col. 1992). Los IMAOs bloquean la degradacion de todas las monoaminas pero requieren restricciones en la dieta que algunos pacientes consideran dificiles de seguir o que les asustan. Todas estas medicaciones interactuan con los sistemas serotoninergico, dopaminergico, noradrenergico o del acido gamma-amino-butirico. Existe una interaccion significativa entre estos sistemas y actualmente no esta claro cuales estan involucrados en la fobia social. En muchos aspectos, el perfil mixto de recaptacion de la venlafaxina parece ofrecer varias de las ventajas teraVenlafaxina en el tratamiento de la fobia social",

Usually, the synkinesis is operative in only one way. For instance, in Bell's phenomenon the closure of the eyelids is accompanied by an upturning of the eyeball, not vice versa. Such associated movements have been recognized as expressions of reflex and coordinative mechanisms within the central nervous system. The unnatural appearance of an unwilled contraction of a muscle when another muscle is called into action has intrigued clinicians and has provoked much thought and speculation. Sometimes such pathologic synkineses have been noted early in life or have not been associated with any history or evidence of disease or trauma. These have been assumed to be congenital or even hereditary in origin. Most times, the associated movements have occurred with a",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Fibromyalgia is an entity that affects approximately 2% of the population, mainly women. According to many studies, approximately half of women with fibromyalgia have a history of traumatic events during childhood or adulthood. Affective disorders before and after fibromyalgia diagnosis are particularly frequent. Materials and methods: Comprehensive review of the scientific literature (Medline, Psychoinfo, Medex) on psychiatric comorbidity in women diagnosed with fibromyalgia published over the last three years. Results: 40-60% of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia report sexual abuse during childhood or adulthood; A higher percentage of women (over 70%) report other kinds of physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia has been linked to mood disorders in 50-70% of patients. More precisely, it appears in combination with major depression in 20% of cases. To a lesser but still noteworthy extent, women with fibromyalgia are also diagnosed with dysthymia, anxiety disorders, phobias or panic disorders. Conclusion: Despite the common characteristics of these patients there is no such thing as a “fibromyalgic personality”. As for comorbidity, mood disorders are highly prevalent, more specifically depression, even though no direct relationship has been established between them. Fibromyalgia symptoms are more acute in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "### Treatment of tobacco addiction\n\nMost smokers show symptoms of addiction to nicotine.1 The symptoms and signs of addiction are described by diagnostic classification systems, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . However, perhaps the most important symptom in this context is the failure of attempts to stop smoking when a person tries to accomplish this. Frequent smoking is thought to set up a subconscious learning process linked to the release of nicotine from cigarettes.2 When a person decides to stop smoking, s/he is afflicted by urges to smoke, often in places where smoking has previously taken place.3 Furthermore, such a person usually experiences withdrawal symptoms.4 These are mostly adverse moods, but with some physical symptoms as well. It is thought that these urges to smoke are primarily responsible for the failure of most attempts to stop smoking. Without support around half of all attempts to stop fail within the first week of attempted abstinence.5 The typical smoker who seeks treatment for cessation has never managed more than a few weeks without smoking.6 The period of withdrawal varies by symptom, but typically lasts a few weeks.4 Therefore most smokers' experience of not smoking is state of withdrawal and perhaps beliefs that smoking is a stress reliever, for example, stem from experiencing withdrawal during abstinence.\n\nThe two main approaches to assist cessation are pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation aims primarily to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or ameliorate the aversive symptoms. Behavioural support aims to boost or support motivation to resist the urge to smoke and develop people's capacity to implement their plans to avoid smoking. These interventions last typically only a few months. It is thought that during these months, the strength of the associative learning between smoking and …",

The diagnosis is established after other causes of anisocoria have been excluded. The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of benign episodic mydriasis of her right pupil in a 23-year-old female patient. The episodes lasted for 5-10 minutes and occurred spontaneously, without any concomitant symptoms or precipitating factors. The frequency of the episodes was variable, but she reported that it worsened in periods when she felt more mentally stressed or anxious. Contact with any kind of medications, homoeopathic drugs, industrial agents, or any other kind of chemical compounds was excluded, and the remaining neurological and systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood tests were taken and imaging was performed, which ruled out a structural lesion. A diagnosis of isolated benign episodic mydriasis was established. Unlike the typical presentation of the condition, the episodes did not occur in association with any form of migraine or headache. Given the benign nature of the condition, no treatment was instituted. After excluding potentially severe causes, and reassuring the patient, the frequency of the episodes decreased.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The clinical diagnosis of disorders of arousal (DOA) is based primarily on a clinical history including amnesia for episodes. The presence of amnesia means the patient cannot provide direct evidence. In a forensic setting, when the defendant has been charged criminally with violent actions or sexual related assaults allegedly during sleep, a sleepwalking defense may be presented. As opposed to clinical history, the prosecution generally focuses on the single episode of alleged DOA that resulted in the criminal charges against the defendant. The prosecution will argue that this episode of complex behavior was not consistent with a DOA. A past history of purported episodes is not proof that a recent single episode must be a DOA. However, most sleepwalking defenses rely heavily on standard clinical evaluations despite the fact they have no direct connection with the current criminally charged episode. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) General Diagnostic Criteria C for DOAs that states “limited or no associated cognition” should be present. Recent real time studies of DOAs have shown that during DOA episodes the prefrontal cortex (PRC) is deactivated while the motor cortex remains active. Conclusion The PFC is the location of almost all executive functions including inhibition, planning, memory, and many others. Thus, when the PFC is deactivated, these higher cognitive functions are not available. The presence of higher cognitive functions during an alleged episode of DOA would be inconsistent with a deactivated PFC and thus inconsistent with generally accepted brain activity during a NREM parasomnia. This would be direct evidence that the episode could not be a DOA but occurred during wakefulness. Clinical trial No.",

      "abstract": "The onset of schizophrenic disorders generally occurs in late adolescence/early adulthood. However, in 75% of the cases, the onset is preceded by a prodromal stage. Subjects concerned by these prodromal symptoms are defined at \"high risk\" for psychosis (30% of conversion to psychosis in the next year). Early detection programs aim at improving the recognition of the prodromal symptoms in order to develop appropriate early interventions that will delay or prevent conversion to psychosis or reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). Atypical antipsychotics are not recommended when psychotic symptoms are only attenuated, while they must be rapidly prescribed when a franc psychotic episode is present. Early identification of patients with schizophrenia is a general practitioners' task provided that they can rely on a supportive specialized psychiatric team. Early intervention should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the subject, in order to propose personalized care that include cognitive therapy, psycho-education, and treatment of associated disorders (depression, substance abuse). The reduction of duration of untreated psychosis will also require sensibilization campaigns in the community with the hope to improve access to care and service delivery.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is estimated to affect about 24% of adult males and 9% of adult females. The prevalence rate of OSA with excessive daytime sleepiness was reported to be 5-7 % in adult males and 3-4 % in adult females. Since these publications, the incidence and prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for OSA, has increased significantly. Central sleep apnea (CSA)m is a conglomerate of different conditions, including: primary CSA, Cheyne-Stokes breathing-CSA (CSB-CSA) pattern, high-altitude periodic breathing, CSA due to medical conditions not Cheyne- Stokes, and CSA due to drugs or substances. Another newly recognized CSA syndrome is complex sleep apnea, which is seen during treatment of OSA, generally before the obstructive events are completely abolished by positive airway pressure (PAP). Primary CSA is uncommon in adults and is seen in less than 10% of patients presenting polysomnography (PSG). The prevalence of primary CSA, high-altitude periodic breathing, and CSA due to medical conditions in the general population are unknown. The obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is also known as obesity-associated hypoventilation or Pickwickian syndrome. Criteria for OHS includes a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia, in the absence of pulmonary or neuromuscular disease. Epidemiological data on insomnia has been confounded by multiple definitions; most of the studies account for three insomnia symptoms: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep and early morning awakenings. Insomnia symptoms were reported to be present in about one-third of the general population. Non-restorative sleep, which is also part of the insomnia definition (ICSD-2), is rarely explored. When daytime consequences of insomnia are taken into account, the prevalence is estimated to be around 10%. Overall, daytime consequences may be as prevalent as 2/3 of insomnia subjects. Narcolepsy is classically defined by sleepiness and abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-related symptoms (cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis). In one study, the prevalence of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy has been reported as 30.6 per 100,000 people (18 years or older), narcolepsy with cataplexy as 21.8/ 100,000 people and narcolepsy with HLA-DQB1 *0602 as 15.3/ 100,000 people. In 18,980 randomly selected subjects, representative of a target population of 205 million European inhabitants, excessive daytime sleepiness was reported by 15% of the sample, napping two times or more in the same day was reported by 1.6% of the sample, while cataplexy (episodes of loss of muscle function related to a strong emotion) was found in 1.6% of the sample. A narcolepsy diagnosis was reported in 47/100,000 people, severe for 26/100,000 and moderate in 21/100,000. Multiple sleep-onset REM periods and short mean sleep latencies (of less than 8 minutes) were reported in about 4% of the general population.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) delirium is a common complication after major surgery and related among other potential medical precipitants to either pre-existing cognitive impairment or the intensity and length of anesthesiology or the type of surgery. Nevertheless, in some rare situations, an organic etiology is not always found, which can be frustrating for the medical team. Some clinicians working in an intensive care unit have a reluctance to seek another hypothesis in the psychological field. Method: To illustrate this, we report the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed a massive delirium during her intensive care unit stay after being operated on for a left retroperitoneal sarcoma. Interestingly, she had had no previous cognitive disorders and a somatic explanation for her psychiatric disorder could not been found. Just before the surgery, she was grieving the recent loss of a colleague of the same age, and also a close friend, and therefore had a death anxiety. Results: With this case report, we would like to point out the importance of psychological factors that might precipitate delirium in a predominately somatic environment such as an intensive care unit. Significance of results: ICU delirium can sometimes be considered as a “psychosomatic” problem with either a stress response syndrome after surgery or a defense mechanism against death anxiety. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of such psychological factors even if they always must first rule out potential somatic causes for delirium and encourage thorough investigation and treatment of these medical causes. A collaboration with the psycho-oncologist is recommended to better manage this “psychosomatic” problem.",

It is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve palsy. It has been described in patients of all ages, but the incidence is slightly higher after age 40. Methods: Using internet search, a comprehensive literature review was done and words such as facial nerve palsy, Bell’s palsy were searched. Results: In confirmed Bell’s palsy, unless contraindicated, corticosteroids should be given to all patients with Bell’s palsy as early as possible, (ideally within 72 hours). Combination therapy with steroids and antiviral agents are recommended for patients with severe to complete paresis. Patients with incomplete eye closure should be given eye protection, with lubricating drops and ointments, to prevent corneal damage. Conclusion: Establishing the correct diagnosis is imperative to avoid missing another treatable condition. Determining whether the facial nerve paralysis is central or peripheral is important. The history of a Bell’s palsy case should include discomfort or sensory symptoms in the distribution of the facial nerve in the hours or days preceding facial palsy, and it is very important to reveal whether the symptoms were progressive in nature. Although many patients with Bell palsy will experience improvement in their facial nerve function without treatment, persistent facial weakness can have implications for quality of life. Choosing the correct treatment options for suitable patients can optimize the likelihood of recovery. Oral steroids should be prescribed within 72 hours of symptoms onset for Bell’s palsy patients. Combined steroid and antiviral treatment are recommended for patients with severe to complete paresis. Physiotherapy may be suggested in severe Bell’s palsy. Surgical decompression is not recommended and may be considered in severe facial nerve degeneration on electroneuronography if the patient is willing to accept the surgical risks. Eye protection remains crucial in preventing long-term eye complications. Clinical and ophthalmological follow-up, and referral to a specialist for patients with no improvement or progressive weakness are recommended.

      "abstract": "Stress is a necessary component of life. All living things go through periods of stress at some point in their existence. The word \"stress\" has become widely used in everyday speech in recent years. Stress, in Lazarus's definition, is an internal process that arises when an individual perceives that a demand exceeds their capacity to adequately respond to it, and when failing to meet that capacity can have significant negative repercussions [1]. The body reacts to stress in a manner akin to how it reacts to danger. A condition of wellbeing known as mental health can motivate people to make positive decisions. In a similar vein, when someone is dealing with an issue, it negatively impacts their mental health and causes their mental wellness to decline. In industrialized nations, menopause typically begins between the ages of 40 and 58. 52 is the average age in the United States (Trusted Source). Some will experience it sooner as a result of a medical condition or treatment (ovaries removed, for example). Hormonal changes brought on by menopause might result in mood swings, heat flashes, and other symptoms. The main focus of the study was to swot on “Stress among Women during Menopause- Impact on Mental Health”. Women who are in the age group of 45 -55 years were selected for the study. The sample consists of 60 women belongs to Madakasira village, Sathya Sai district for the study. Menopause problems questionnaire was developed by the researcher with the guidelines of subject experts it was pre-tested to other sample before going to actual sample. According to the study, women experience a great deal of irritation and fury during menopause, along with anxiety, forgetfulness, low self-esteem, confidence loss, low mood, and feelings of melancholy or despair. These symptoms are sometimes referred to as \"brain fog\" and/or \"lost words.\"",

      "title": "Efavirenz precipitating hallucinations in a patient with an undetected psychotic prodrome",
      "abstract": "A number of antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV have been linked to neuropsychiatric side-effects. Perhaps the most well known is efavirenz (Sustiva; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey, USA), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which has been documented to produce psychosis in several case reports [1–3], although larger studies examining the relationship have drawn mixed conclusions [4,5]. One important consideration in prescribing psychiatrically active medications is a patient's premorbid risk for developing a psychiatric disorder. Elements of risk come from a positive family history, substance abuse (especially cannabis), and, importantly, evidence of a psychotic prodrome: symptoms occurring early in the natural history of a psychotic illness that may precede frank positive symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions. A psychotic prodrome occurs in the majority of patients before their ‘first break’ of overt psychosis [6], and the neurobiology, detection, and treatment of the prodrome are a major area of research in psychiatry [6–10]. None of the existing case reports on psychosis related to efavirenz use occurred in a patient clearly exhibiting signs of a psychotic prodrome, although one case described a strong family history and early affective symptoms of bipolar disorder [2]. We present a case of a 25-year-old patient with poorly controlled HIV who was exhibiting classic signs of a psychotic prodrome before starting antiretroviral therapy. Exposure to efavirenz as part of a HAART regimen appeared to immediately and permanently ‘tip’ this patient from a prodromal psychosis into a frank psychotic episode with hallucinations. Mr E was a 25-year-old HIV-positive man admitted to the medical ward after presenting to the emergency department with 6 months of whole-body rash and fatigue, determined to be the result of secondary syphilis. At the time of presentation, his HIV was poorly controlled (absolute CD4+ cell count 26, HIV RNA 188 575 copies/ml), and he told hospital physicians that he had self-discontinued his most recent HAART regimen (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir) 18 months prior to presentation because he experienced the onset of visual hallucinations shortly after initiating therapy. As he had tolerated emtricitabine and tenofovir in an earlier regimen, efavirenz was the most likely responsible agent. The hallucinations did not remit after he stopped taking his medicines, and he did not seek care from either infectious disease or psychiatry. In the hospital, psychiatry was consulted to better characterize the patient's hallucinations and to determine if they were related to his HAART regimen. The psychiatry service identified clear signs of a psychotic prodrome beginning at age 15, 5 years before his diagnosis of HIV. At that time, he exhibited a preoccupation with numbers and weather patterns, believing he had special insight into their meaning (ideas of reference); believed his mother could place thoughts in his mind (thought insertion); and had antisocial and paranoid personality traits commonly thought to precede psychosis [11]. In addition, he had been arrested three times for impulsive acts of violence, had at least one manic episode including homicidal ideation, and had been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation. We diagnosed the patient with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and determined that the patient's efavirenz exposure was likely the catalyst progressing the patient from a prodromal, schizotypal state into full psychosis. We began treatment with an atypical antipsychotic and recommended avoiding efavirenz in future antiretroviral regimens. This case is an important example of a patient with undetected early-stage symptoms of a severe mental illness for whom exposure to an antiretroviral drug precipitated the patient's development of severe psychosis. This suggests that caution should be used in prescribing efavirenz not only to patients who may endorse the kinds of symptoms commonly screened for in a psychiatric review of systems (e.g., auditory and visual hallucinations, ideas of reference) but also when prescribing to patients who may have more subtle indicators of a prepsychotic state. These symptoms include social anxiety, magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, antisociality, constricted affect, odd behavior, and suspiciousness or paranoia. Simply knowing what to ask is of the essence here; one sensitive and widely used instrument to simplify this task is the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire [12]. The disabling and potentially irreversible nature of neuropsychiatric side-effects of antiretrovirals are a compelling reason for clinicians to move beyond the psychiatric review of systems and toward a comprehensive evaluation of any evidence of a high-risk state for developing psychosis. Factors to consider include family history, cannabis use, and symptoms of a psychotic prodrome, which may go unnoticed without directed attention. Extra caution should be applied when prescribing these patients a psychiatrically implicated antiretroviral medication. Acknowledgements Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "Sexual function and to a lesser extent reproduction are often disrupted in women with spinal cord injuries (SCI), who must be educated to better understand their sexual and reproductive health. Women with SCI are sexually active; they can use psychogenic or reflexogenic stimulation to obtain sexual pleasure and orgasm. Treatment should consider a holistic approach using autonomic standards to describe remaining sexual function and to assess both genital function and psychosocial factors. Assessment of genital function should include thoracolumbar dermatomes, vulvar sensitivity (touch, pressure, vibration), and sacral reflexes. Self-exploration should include not only clitoral stimulation, but also stimulation of the vagina (G spot), cervix, and nipples conveyed by different innervation sources. Treatments may consider PDE5 inhibitors and flibanserin on an individual basis, and secondary consequences of SCI should address concerns with spasticity, pain, incontinence, and side effects of medications. Psychosocial issues must be addressed as possible contributors to sexual dysfunctions (eg, lower self-esteem, past sexual history, depression, dating habits). Pregnancy is possible for women with SCI; younger age at the time of injury and at the time of pregnancy being significant predictors of successful pregnancy, along with marital status, motor score, mobility, and occupational scores. Pregnancy may decrease the level of functioning (eg, self-care, ambulation, upper-extremity tasks), may involve complications (eg, decubitus ulcers, weight gain, urological complications), and must be monitored for postural hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia. Taking into consideration the physical and psychosocial determinants of sexuality and childbearing allows women with SCI to achieve positive sexual and reproductive health.",

      "abstract": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are medications that are frequently prescribed for gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, a few case reports have described neuropsychiatric symptoms following PPI use. In this report, we present a case of visual hallucinations secondary to PPI usage and propose possible mechanisms. In this case, a 65-year-old man with no psychiatric history developed acute visual hallucinations following initiation of omeprazole, in the absence of delusions, paranoia, and other psychotic symptoms. The visual hallucinations began after the patient started treatment with omeprazole and resolved almost immediately upon discontinuation of omeprazole. To treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, omeprazole was replaced with famotidine, and the visual hallucinations did not recur after the omeprazole had been discontinued. No other psychotic signs or symptoms were present in this patient throughout the duration of his hospitalization. Although the scientific literature provides limited information on psychosis related to PPI use, a growing number of case reports and studies in recent years have suggested that neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur after PPI use. It is our hope that this case report adds to the scientific and medical knowledge in this area.",

It is reported that the prevalence of chronic sleep-related complaints in older adults is over 50%, which is higher than that in younger adults. The etiology of sleep disorders in older adults is considered to be multifactorial, consisting of normal age-related changes(e.g., sleep fragmentation, earlier awakening, and decreased slow wave sleep), medical or psychiatric diseases (e.g., lifestyle-related diseases, dementia, delirium, and depression), primary age-related sleep disorders(e.g., sleep-related breathing disorders and periodic limb movement disorders), or a combination of these factors. Because sleep disorders in older adults may have implications for quality of life, it is crucial to distinguish normal age-related sleep changes from those originating from pathological processes.

The multiple aetiologies of these disorders are imperfectly understood, and tend to be grouped under the broad heading of cerebral palsy.\n\nCerebral palsy is usually defined as a non-progressive neurological syndrome caused by injury to the immature brain, although recent data have questioned whether the pathological progress is genuinely non-progressive.1 The predominant feature is motor impairment, although about half of the affected population will have significant cognitive or intellectual impairment, and these children comprise about 50% of the total number of those with severe mental retardation in the community.2 Associated features such as visual impairment, hearing loss, or feeding problems are common.\n\nThe birth prevalence of cerebral palsy shows geographical variations, but is generally in the range of 1.5-3 per 1000 live births.3 Trends in prevalence over time have been somewhat contradictory; a fall from 2.24 to 1.9 per 1000 occurred in Sweden between 1954-8 and 1967-70,4 whereas in Western Australia a significant rise from 2.2 to 2.5 per 1000 occurred over a similar period.5 However, in the past two decades most investigators have found a significant increase in the birth prevalence of cerebral palsy, due largely to an increase in the rates recorded for extremely small or preterm infants.6 There is some evidence that this increase is now being reversed.7 \n\nEpidemiological analysis has defined a large number of risk factors for cerebral palsy, including low birth weight, preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, neurological disorder in mother or sibling, thyroid disease or therapy during pregnancy, thyroid hormone deficiency in preterm infants, low placental weight, chorioamnionitis, birth asphyxia, and neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia.

      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlexia is the phenomenon of spontaneous and precocious mastery of single‐word reading that has been of interest to clinicians and researchers since the beginning of the last century. Methods: An extensive search of publications on the subject of hyperlexia was undertaken and all available publications were reviewed. Results: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) whether hyperlexia should be defined through single‐word reading superiority with regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6) whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability (talent). Conclusions: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single‐word reading in the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a discrepancy between levels of single‐word reading and comprehension). We simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi‐methodological approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research framework of understanding single‐word reading, are warranted and encouraged.",

[1] have emphasized the high prevalence of hypnagogic and/or hypnopompic hallucinations present respectively in 37 and 12.5% of the 4972 subjects. The rate of hypnagogic hallucinations was related to age. Women were more likely to report such hallucinations. The most frequent type of hallucinations was unexpected, that is kinesthesic (feeling of falling in an abyss) but all types of hallucinations could be present. These hallucinations had no relationship to a specific pathology in more than 50% of the cases but were exclusively present at nighttime. In old age, visual hallucinations are the most frequent. In a cohort of old non-demented subjects, 17.4% of them had hallucinations and behavioural symptoms (anxious agitation or/and irritability). Several neurological pathologies included sleep disorders and hallucinations. Narcolepsy and Parkinson disease (P.D.) will be only considered here. In narcolepsy, with or without cataplexy, hallucinations are now called “secondary” symptom, as they are incidental, reported in 35 to 66% of the patients. Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are most often visual but all types have been described, formed, without whole scenes but terrifying the patient who is often implicated in it and sometimes associated with sleep paralysis, especially during daytime when sleep occurs in REM. Are they pieces of dream? These hallucinations can be differentiated on a phenomenological basis from hallucinations in healthy subjects and from hallucinations in schizophrenia [2]. They have also some differences with hallucinations observed in P.D. [3]. In P.D. hallucinations affected 25% of the patients in long duration disease. They are mainly visual, or with sensation of a presence (person or animal), coexisting with delusions and anxiety. They are rarely only a side- effect of dopaminergic treatment but are often linked to daytime sleepiness with REM sleep attacks, described in this disease and to cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

      "title": "Delayed onset and resolution of pain: Some observations and implications",
      "abstract": "Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.",

When reviewing cases, psychotic symptoms of sudden onset are described a few days before menstruation, with the symptoms resolving in a self-limited way when the bleeding ends. The end of psychotic symptoms is not directly related to the use of antipsychotics. The complete clinical picture is nonspecific and fluctuating. With acute onset, short duration, cyclical repetition, with psychotic symptoms (mutism, confusion, delusions, hallucinations) or a manic episode. We present the case of a 14-year-old adolescent with a history of epileptic seizures in childhood, without current treatment. She goes to the emergency department brought by her father and brother presenting psychomotor agitation, verbiage, flight of ideas, loss of the common thread in the speech, referring delusional ideas with experience of harm. His relatives report that he has not slept for a few days, with soliloquies, unmotivated laughter. They refer that the picture has been repeated in recent months during the days of menstruation. Objectives Knowing a diagnosis not included in the current classifications. Methods Imaging tests and neurological evaluations rule out organic picture. Results Given the periodicity of the condition, the symptoms are self-limiting at the end of menstruation, without a clear relationship with psychopharmacological treatment (although agitation improves).

      "title": "Substance use disorders before and after liver transplantation",
      "abstract": "Watch a video presentation of this article Watch the interview with the author Substance use disorder (SUD) is defined as a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating that an individual continues to use a substance despite significant substance-related problems.1 This definition highlights the psychological complexity of continuing a behavior despite unequivocal evidence that it is harmful. This conundrum is stark in the setting of liver transplantation (LT), especially when the substance is the source of the liver injury. Continued use of a harmful substance is a complex balance between the internal drive to use, external pressures to use, and the individuals' subjective estimate of the immediate benefits versus the harms. Table 1 lists some of the common features of SUDs. SUDs are often long term and include personal injury, damage to family and other social relationships, and in cases of illicit substances, contravening the law. Continued use predicts noncompliance with medical directives in recipients of transplanted organs.2 There is a paucity of prospective studies of interventions to treat SUDs in the LT population either before or after transplantation. The substances of interest in the LT population include legal agents (alcohol, tobacco, prescribed opioids, and in some states, marijuana) and illicit agents. In some cases, such as chronic alcohol use resulting in alcoholic liver disease (ALD), the substance of abuse has a direct and recent relation to the cause of liver failure necessitating LT. In other cases, distant substance use has led to the acquisition of chronic viral hepatitis. Finally, there are forms of SUD where the link between substance use and the injury is not obvious. Tobacco addiction is an example of a widespread SUD that does not have direct hepatotoxicity and yet is highly deleterious to the LT recipient. The impact of SUDs in the field of LT begins with selection for LT. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 2013 Practice Guidelines recommend that patients with SUDs receive a psychosocial evaluation during the evaluation for LT with input from psychiatrists or addiction medicine because of the potential impact on transplant outcomes.3 Many payer agencies require a defined interval of abstinence before listing for LT. It is the prerogative of each LT program to make their own rules regarding the assessment of and response to SUDs because there are no mandatory restrictions at the federal level or by agencies such as the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and the United Network for Organ Sharing. There is great inconsistency both between centers and even within centers when interpreting the significance of an SUD history, especially in regard to alcohol use disorder.4 On the other hand, the refusal to place a patient with a history of recent illicit drug use seems widespread. We lack reliable data on how US LT programs interpret current tobacco or marijuana use. Finally, prescription opioid use is even more opaque, because in many cases “opiate substitution” is not a recognized SUD. Alcohol is perhaps the most studied substance of abuse in the LT population. Unfortunately, data on relapse after LT are compromised by inconsistent definitions about use (i.e., “any use,” “slips versus relapse,” “harmful drinking”), the tendency of patients to hide drinking, the difficulty of recognizing clandestine drinking, and retrospection. Despite these limitations we can confidently assert that alcohol relapse is associated with more rapid progression of fibrosis in the allograft and increased mortality after LT, albeit at 10 years.5, 6 Tobacco use is also highly prevalent in patients with chronic liver disease, especially ALD. It is our impression that most LT programs in the United States do not require a period of abstinence from smoking as part of the transplant evaluation. Relapse after LT is common. For example, DiMartini et al.7 showed in a prospective cohort of ALD LT recipients that persons who smoked before LT returned to heavy smoking very soon after LT. Cigarette smoking after LT leads to an increased risk for aerodigestive cancers and cardiovascular disease.8, 9 There are no prospective studies of tobacco cessation treatment programs in LT recipients. Opioid substitution therapy is relatively common in the LT population. Patients maintained on methadone should continue because substance relapse is rare in methadone-maintained LT recipients.10 Patients on chronic opioids also require special attention to pain and opioid management during both the perioperative period and beyond. In a retrospective study, Randall et al.11 demonstrated graded increases in death and graft failure associated with increasing doses of prescribed opioids up to 5 years after LT. The cause of this increased mortality and morbidity is unknown. Marijuana has known effects on short-term memory, and isolated case reports of aspergillosis were associated with smoking contaminated cannabis, but otherwise studies are limited. Aside from incorporating an addiction specialist in the care team, we have no specific recommendations regarding the management of SUDs before or after LT. The evidence for clear benefit of one treatment strategy over another in this setting is scant.12 Many of the commonly used pharmacotherapies are not US Food and Drug Administration–approved for use in end-stage liver disease. There are also hidden barriers to treatment, including the conviction of the patient that his or her addiction has ceased or that the therapy is too cumbersome or potentially dangerous to the allograft.13 Nonetheless, the known morbidity and mortality related to alcohol and tobacco highlights the importance of optimizing various practitioners' efforts, including those of primary care and addiction specialists. SUDs and chronic liver disease are two distinct diagnoses with close interdependence and relevance in LT outcomes. Vague guidelines, imperfect payer criteria, coupled with intercenter and intracenter policy and practice variability, translate to inconsistent access and at times unnecessary exclusion for patients in need of a lifesaving therapy. Concerted efforts are warranted to reduce tobacco and alcohol use while fostering candor and transparency with our patients regarding substance use and transplant eligibility.",

Increased prevalence also has been associated with emotional stresses, psychologic disturbances, and lower socioeconomic status. Further, insomnia is associated with increased morbidity,4and possibly mortality,5rates, as well as with the potential development of major psychiatric disorders.6Chronic insomnia is difficult to treat and has major psychosocial consequences, including its frequent negative impact on the patient's family and employment.

Women complain of unbidden feelings of genital arousal that are qualitatively different from sexual arousal that is preceded by sexual desire/and or subjective arousal. The majority of women find PGAD distressing and report only brief relief with orgasm. In this article, we describe five women who believe they developed PGAD either after withdrawing from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants or while using them. We discuss these sexual symptoms in relation to what is already known about prolonged SSRI withdrawal syndromes and the possible etiologies of these conditions. While not a common cause of PGAD, it is possible that use of, and withdrawal from, pharmacological agents contributes to the development of PGAD.",

Of 52,360 children, 39,270 of whom were followed for the full 7 years, a total of 2,635 experienced one or more seizures between birth and 7 years of age. The incidence of nonfebrile convulsions was highest in the first year of life, especially in the first month. Children with neonatal seizures who later developed nonfebrile seizures did so early, two‐thirds by 6 months and three‐quarters by 1 year of age. Children with neurological or developmental abnormality assessed in the first year of life did not have their first seizure earlier than children without abnormality. Neurological abnormality in the first year of life before any seizure, and the presence of minor motor seizures, were associated with an increased rate of mental retardation and cerebral palsy at age 7, but early age at onset appeared to have little prognostic value regarding intellectual function, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy.",

A longitudinal study of 16 of these patients showed a stereotyped electroclinical evolution. At first, only extreme somatosensory evoked potential (ESEPs) were observed in nonepileptic children with normal EEG records (first period). Then, after a variable delay, spontaneous EEG abnormalities appeared, first only during sleep, and then also during wakefulness, usually as spikes involving the same parietal and midline regions where the ESEPs were evident (second and third periods). Seizures then began (fourth period) within 5 months to 2 years after the appearance of the interictal focal abnormalities. Such seizures were rare, but in some cases they were grouped in bouts that amounted to status epilepticus. The seizures were usually of the partial motor type, with adversion of the head, but infrequently they assumed the tonic-clonic type; they occurred mainly during the daytime. The fits were short-lived, however, and after a year had mostly disappeared, while the ESEPs and spontaneous interictal focal abnormalities sometime persisted for several year before disappearing, too. The subjects were otherwise neurologically and psychologically normal throughout the observation and follow-up period.",

The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all. Nevertheless the scrupulous remain. It is in the West among Latins that scrupulosity is found in its endemic state, whereas it is unknown among Eastern Catholics and Orthodox . . .’",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver.

Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "abstract": "Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, characterized by an acute change in mental status with a fluctuating course of symptoms, that affects almost 50% of people aged 65 years or older, admitted to hospital. Delirium is associated with negative outcomes, including increased risk of mortality, cognitive and functional decline. In 50% of the cases, the cause of delirium is multifactorial, resulting from a complex inter-relationship between several predisposing factors (e.g. advanced age, dementia) in highly vulnerable patients that are exposed to precipitating factors (e.g. infections). In this context, cognitive impairment and dementia are important risk factors for delirium, increasing its risk by two to five times, associated with worse outcomes. The underlying brain vulnerability of these patients with dementia may predispose to the development of delirium, as a consequence of insults related to the acute medical disease, medication or environmental factors. On the other hand, delirium may cause permanent neuronal damage, which may lead to the development or worsening of a pre-existing dementia. As a result, delirium and dementia frequently coexist and overlap, challenging differential diagnosis. The identification of risk factors for delirium, specifically pre-existing cognitive impairment or dementia, in elderly people admitted to hospital is essential to the implementation of preventive strategies that may contribute to the decrease of delirium rates. The present literature review aims to highlight the association between delirium and dementia in elderly people, focusing on diagnosis, pathophysiology, prevention, and management.

      "abstract": "Musical hallucinations are a kind of auditory hallucination that are prevalent among the non-psychiatric population, but which have rarely been reported in the neurological literature. They occur most frequently in the elderly, in females and when there is a loss of hearing, but their pathophysiology has still to be unravelled.We report here six cases (five females and one male) of musical hallucinations diagnosed in a general neurology clinic over a time-span of five years. In five cases there was also concurrent hypoacusis, to a greater or lesser extent, and one had been triggered by pentoxifylline. In most instances, the musical content of the hallucinations had its origins in music experienced in childhood and early youth. In the cases submitted to pharmacological treatment, the response was poor. Yet, after explaining to the patients that the condition was benign and had no connection with a psychotic pathology, the degree of acceptance of the symptoms was good.Musical hallucinations are a little-known pathology lying on the borderline between neurology, otorhinolaryngology and psychiatry which are often wrongly linked to mental disease. It is essential to explain to patients and relatives that these symptoms are not necessarily of a psychiatric nature, and to be aware of the potential capacity of some commonly used drugs to generate them.Alucinaciones musicales: la musica perpetua.Introduccion. Las alucinaciones musicales son un tipo de alucinacion auditiva prevalente en la poblacion no psiquiatrica, pero escasamente comunicada en la bibliografia neurologica. Ocurren con mayor frecuencia en la poblacion anciana, del sexo femenino y con perdida de audicion, pero su fisiopatologia esta por desentrañar. Casos clinicos. Se presentan seis casos (cinco mujeres y un hombre) de alucinaciones musicales diagnosticados en una consulta de neurologia general en un lapso de tiempo de cinco años. En cinco de ellos concurria la hipoacusia en mayor o menor grado y uno estaba desencadenado por la pentoxifilina. En su mayoria, el contenido musical de las alucinaciones provenia de experiencias musicales vividas en la infancia y juventud. En los casos sometidos a tratamiento farmacologico la respuesta fue pobre; sin embargo, una vez explicada a los pacientes la benignidad del cuadro y su desvinculacion con patologia psicotica, el grado de aceptacion del sintoma fue bueno. Conclusiones. Las alucinaciones musicales son una patologia fronteriza entre la neurologia, la otorrinolaringologia y la psiquiatria poco conocida, que, con frecuencia, se vincula erroneamente a la enfermedad mental. Es fundamental explicar a pacientes y familiares el caracter no necesariamente psiquiatrico de este sintoma, asi como conocer la potencialidad que tienen algunos farmacos de uso comun para generarlo.",

      "title": "Movement disorders in patients with peripheral facial palsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute unilateral facial paralysis is usually a benign neurological condition that resolves in a few weeks. However, it can also be the source of a transient or long‐lasting severe motor dysfunction, featuring disorders of automatic and voluntary movement. This review is organized according to the two most easily recognizable phases in the evolution of facial paralysis: (1) Just after presentation of facial palsy, patients may exhibit an increase in their spontaneous blinking rate as well as a sustained low‐level contraction of the muscles of the nonparalyzed side, occasionally leading to blepharospasm‐like muscle activity. This finding may be due to an increase in the excitability of facial motoneurons and brainstem interneurons mediating trigeminofacial reflexes. (2) If axonal damage has occurred, axonal regeneration beginning at approximately 3 months after the lesion leads inevitably to clinically evident or subclinical hyperactivity of the previously paralyzed hemifacial muscles. The full‐blown postparalytic facial syndrome consists of synkinesis, myokymia, and unwanted hemifacial mass contractions accompanying normal facial movements. The syndrome has probably multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including abnormal axonal branching after aberrant axonal regeneration and enhanced facial motoneuronal excitability. Although the syndrome is relieved with local injections of botulinum toxin, fear of such uncomfortable contractions may lead the patients to avoid certain facial movements, with the implications that this behavior might have on their emotional expressions. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

      "title": "Targeting epigenetic mechanisms for chronic visceral pain: A valid approach for the development of novel therapeutics",
      "abstract": "Chronic visceral pain is persistent pain emanating from thoracic, pelvic, or abdominal origin that is poorly localized with regard to the specific organ affected. The prevalence can range up to 25% in the adult population as chronic visceral pain is a common feature of many visceral disorders, which may or may not be accompanied by distinct structural or histological abnormalities within the visceral organs. Mounting evidence suggests that changes in epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the top-down or bottom-up sensitization of pain pathways and the development of chronic pain. Epigenetic changes can lead to long-term alterations in gene expression profiles of neurons and consequently alter functionality of peripheral neurons, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and brain neurons. However, epigenetic modifications are dynamic, and thus, detrimental changes may be reversible. Hence, external factors/therapeutic interventions may be capable of modulating the epigenome and restore normal gene expression for extended periods of time.",

      "title": "Questions in psychiatry (<scp>QuiP</scp>): Psychological basis for sexual dysfunction in psychiatry",
      "abstract": "This article is the fifth in our series on sexual wellbeing and its core components. Together, these brief papers aim to provide a foundation of knowledge, which clinicians can draw upon when assessing sexual functioning. The present article is the first to focus on factors that may negatively impact sexual wellbeing and contribute to sexual dysfunction. Specifically, it examines psychosocial factors, which, along with neurophysiological factors, that will be considered separately in a future QuiP, often contribute to sexual problems. We begin by outlining foundational principles regarding the psychological factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction in any individual, and then build on this with further information that pertains specifically to individuals with mental illness. It is important to note that whilst DSM lists a number of formal sexual disorders, these are not common in routine in clinical practice and not easily assessed. Instead, in clinical assessments involving mental health it is far more useful to describe any sexual dysfunction that causes significant distress in terms of the actual symptoms the person is experiencing (e.g., loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty achieving orgasm). In addition, it is critical to bear in mind that sexual experiences are inherently psychological and subject to the attachment of personal meaning. These then guide our expectations of what our sexual experiences should entail. Although we have mentioned the importance of assessing sexual wellbeing previously, it is important to note that sexual dysfunction is surprisingly common. Indeed, it verges on being the norm with an estimated 45% of all couples experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction at some time or another.1 The most common sexual dysfunction reported by females is low sexual desire (33.4%), followed by inhibited orgasm (24.1%), whereas in males the most common problem is premature ejaculation (28.5%) followed by performance anxiety (17%).2 However, it is also very common for most individuals experiencing sexual dysfunction to feel as though they are among a rare minority experiencing such difficulties. This is because even though the topic of sex seems to be ubiquitous, sexual problems or difficulties are seldom discussed, and may not be disclosed even within a medical context. When examining the psychological components that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, the cognitive-behavioural-emotional (CBE) model serves as a useful framework. This is often utilized in cognitive behavioural therapeutic settings to address various kinds of sexual dysfunction. The CBE model posits that psychological components comprise cognitive, behavioural and emotional domains, which when disrupted can contribute to sexual dysfunction (see Figure 1). These domains are further divided into sub-components that interact with one another and when disturbed can contribute to the development and maintenance of sexual dysfunction. Considering cognitive schemas, these play a significant role in sexual wellbeing, and when negative thinking takes hold, it can impair sexual functioning. For example, following a negative sexual experience (e.g., erectile dysfunction, inhibited orgasm, pain), it is possible to develop a 'negative expectancy', which in turn may lead to performance anxiety. If then, in this context, performance is again poor, this reinforces and further entrenches the initial negative cognitions. Other cognitive factors that can play a role include unrealistic standards for sexual experience, which is increasingly common because of widespread exposure to pornography, and 'spectatoring' wherein an individual self-consciously monitors and evaluates their experience rather than focusing on the sensation of the experience itself. Both of these factors can be addressed with psychoeducation. Typically, it is cognitive factors such as these that are amongst the primary factors that have triggered and maintained sexual dysfunction. For example, if a woman has an assumption that women should always orgasm during sex, but this then does not occur on a few occasions in her experiences, she may develop negative attributions regarding the cause, such as 'I am flawed, … something is wrong with me, … something is wrong with my relationship'. This can then lead to feelings of anxiety, frustration, embarrassment, and even shame. In addition, she may develop negative expectancies regarding sex, resulting in avoidance and withdrawal from sexual activities. Thus, a cycle is created and perpetuated, and this can result in what then seems to be a sustained loss of sexual interest, increased anxiety, and depression. The above example demonstrates how sexual dysfunction can be deconstructed into its psychological constituents and traced back to contributing factors, which can then be systematically addressed. The importance of sexual functioning in patients with psychiatric disorders has been discussed previously in this series, and more broadly is recognised as an important domain to assess for overall functioning. Thus, identifying potential psychological factors that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction is important, as it may provide an explanation for the problems the person is experiencing, and perhaps also identify an amenable target for interventions. In addition, as sexual functioning serves as a key indicator of overall functioning, especially in those with mental illnesses where it can serve as an indicator of recovery, addressing any psychological factors that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction is important. It should be noted at this juncture, that sexual dysfunction and the psychological and physiological factors that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, are all interconnected and thus there is a significant degree of overlap and co-occurrence between these components. Hence, our separation is purely pragmatic, and in practice, the two sets of factors should be considered jointly. For example, depression and anxiety often co-occur with physical health conditions such as obesity,4 and any one of a number of individual factors related to these conditions can cause, or be caused by, sexual dysfunction. In reality, a combination of factors is likely to have contributed to these problems and many of these will have a bidirectional causal relationship between sexual dysfunction and mental health. Thus, taking a holistic approach when assessing sexual functioning is critical. When assessing psychological factors that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, it is important to bear in mind that these factors are not necessarily and specifically related to sexual dysfunction per se, but that they can negatively impact functioning more generally. Thus, the psychological factors that need to be assessed during a routine psychiatric assessment remain largely the same. In addition, it is their potential impact on the domain of sexual functioning that needs to be given further consideration. Note, this is alongside their impact on other domains of functioning such as an individual's occupation, and relationships (discussed in previous Quip—'Assessing sexual dysfunction in clinical practice'). To exemplify the bidirectional relationship between sexual functioning and psychological factors, consider the observation that healthy sexual functioning usually alleviates stress, but that sexual dysfunction can also lead to psychological problems. Thus, many mental illnesses are associated with dysfunction across a variety of sexual domains. Further, once stress has produced sexual dysfunction, this can itself lead to further stress exacerbating the problems the individual is already experiencing. Trauma, is another significant psychological factor which is increasingly assessed in routine clinical practice. This encompasses various forms of childhood abuse and neglect (sexual, physical, and emotional) and traumatic events experienced in adulthood (see Figure 2). The impact of trauma on domains of functioning (education, occupation, social) is also often assessed in clinical practice; however, its impact on sexual functioning is seldom explored, if at all. It is therefore important to note that trauma can significantly compromise sexual functioning, regardless of the nature and timing of the trauma. In other words, the trauma does not necessarily have to be sexual in nature or have occurred during a critical developmental period for it to have an effect on sexual functioning in an individual. For example, sexual dysfunction is a known symptom in combat veterans with PTSD,5 and therefore, the contribution of trauma to sexual dysfunction should be considered broadly as possible and explored as a potential target for interventions. As pointed out earlier, mental illnesses impact a number of key psychological domains that can negatively impact sexual functioning. The most common mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, which often co-occur and occur alongside other disorders, entail a number of overlapping symptoms which negatively impact sexual functioning and wellbeing. For example, the symptoms of depression can be captured across 3 domains namely, activity, cognition, and emotion (for further detailed explanation, see The ACE Model*). In the domain of activity, the symptoms of fatigue, increased or decreased sleep and weight/appetite, can all impact sexual functioning due to a lack of energy, or impact self-esteem due to changes in weight that alter self-image and confidence. In the domain of cognition, impaired attention and concentration and psychomotor changes can interfere with sexual functioning by limiting mental engagement and preventing psychological arousal and stimulation. Finally, symptoms within the domain of emotion, such as anhedonia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness and depressed mood can all reduce or eliminate libido, which is essential for healthy sexual functioning. A common bedfellow of depression is anxiety, which when excessive can manifest as a disorder. Several symptoms of anxiety disorders overlap with those of depression, and therefore it is not surprising that anxiety can impair sexual functioning. As mentioned above, difficulties in concentration, disturbances in sleep and fatigue can all diminish sexual desire and the ability to engage in sexual behaviours and practices. Furthermore, generalized anxiety may extend to more specific anxiety regarding sexual functioning and performance, and can also cause erectile dysfunction, and anorgasmia in women. Aside from such specific psychiatric disorders, there are some general symptoms that occur in many mental illnesses and can have a significant impact on sexual functioning, regardless of diagnosis. For example, lowered self-esteem that stems from having a mental illness along with the stigma and shame that this may confer, can significantly threaten the integrity of one's sense of self. Understandably then, this can constrain the individual's ability to engage in sexual behaviours and practices even solo activities—especially if libido is also diminished or lost altogether. In this way, having a mental illness places an additional strain on romantic relationships and interferes with intimacy, all of which makes it difficult to form and sustain relationships. In this brief piece, the psychological factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction in any individual have been outlined, and then building on this, the additional psychological factors that occur within the context of psychiatric disorders have been explored. Importantly, many of these factors are already typically assessed in routine clinical practice, however their impact on sexual function is often overlooked. Furthermore, many of these psychological factors are not necessarily specific to any particular diagnosis, therefore it is important to bear these in mind in all patients. Finally, this relationship is bidirectional, and thus when assessing sexual dysfunction, it is equally important to examine its potential psychological sequelae.

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction and Associated Psychiatric Comorbidities Impacting Quality of Life in Epilepsy: A Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Epilepsy is caused by dysfunction in the brain, which is characterized by an enduring disposition for unprovoked seizures that reoccur often, along with the neurological, cognitive, psychological, and social effects of the condition, which are often managed with prolonged and sometimes lifelong medications that involve antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). To confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy, at least two unprovoked seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart should be reported. This illness affects both children and adults. Patients with epilepsy are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction compared to the general population, which often leads to a poor quality of life. The pathophysiology involved consists of the impact of epilepsy and AEDs on the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, consequently resulting in a high risk of developing testicular or ovarian dysfunction, leading to sexual dysfunction in epilepsy patients. Aim: This review aims to highlight various studies focusing on the association of developing the risk of sexual dysfunction with psychiatric comorbidities, mainly depression and anxiety, that impact the quality of life in epilepsy patients. Methodology: The search methodology involved articles from the Google Scholar and PubMed databases published between 2018 and 2023. \"Sexual dysfunction\", \"epilepsy\", \"depression\", \"anxiety\", and \"quality of life\" were the keywords used to search the articles. The Boolean operator \"AND\" and \"OR\" were used in between the keywords used. Following this, a total of 15 articles were included in the review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conclusion: The review concluded that epilepsy patients are often affected by sexual dysfunction along with associated psychiatric comorbidities that mainly involve depression and anxiety, consequently impacting their quality of life, as demonstrated by various studies. Sexual dysfunction is a common yet underdiagnosed condition in epilepsy patients due to the stigma attached to it. Hence, neurologists must keep a high index of suspicion for this problem. Furthermore, screening and monitoring for sexual dysfunction should be added to the usual epilepsy work-up.",

      "title": "La formación profesional del cuidador de personas con deterioro cognitivo y demencias",
      "abstract": "Cognitive Impairment (CI) and Dementia (D) are chronic and progressive pathologies that as time passes will evolve into a state of dependency (diminution or absence of the ability to perform daily life actions); this implies that the affected person will have to be assisted by a caregiver. In the early stages, this clinical condition shows a loss or pathological decline on cognitive functions (memory, attention, language, praxis, gnosias or executive functions), with certain preservation of functional habilities (Bagnati et al., 2005; Arizaga, 2011). The above said means that in the initial stages the patient has a partially effective development on their daily life, therefore the moments of assistance he or she will require will be few. In advanced stages (moderate and severe) there will be a mayor symptom evolution, which will lead to a longer time  of care, that is, the time load dedicated to the affected person will be increasing. In the early stages, the role of primary caregiver is expected to be carried out by a direct relative, usually a spouse, but as time passes, an external caregiver must be assigned.\r\nAssisting an older adult with neurodegenerative pathology in a state of dependence involves effort and dedication. Those who serve this population for long periods often suffer an overload that impacts on a psycho-emotional level and sometimes require a medical-pharmacological treatment. Among the described risk factors for overload, clinical signs of mild depression appear, alongside with anxiety, high levels of stress and physical discomfort (Mendez & Solano Perez, 2016; Giraldo et al.,  2010; Carrillo et al., 2014). In this regard, there is a plurality of interventions, where self-help groups, psychotherapy and informative workshops stand out. Some authors argue that the specific and concrete contribution generates security and trust in the caregiver, strengthening his or her attitude and disposition to the assistance task (Hernandez et al., 2014).This indicates that there should be specific guidance to perform the task of caring with quality. Quality of care is understood as the ability of the caregiver, their knowledge on the subject and the ability to make decisions (Barrera-Ortiz et al., 2013; Amador-Marin & Guerra Martin, 2017). We currently have free support spaces for family members of people with CI or D, but not a specific space for caregivers. Experts on the subject report that those who daily assist people with these conditions suffer from stress or psycho-affective pathologies due, in many cases, to lack of experience or training in the subject or not having strategies properly organized in a work plan (Alvarado, 2010; Canevaro & Smith, 2013).\r\n In 2012, from a private institution in the city of La Plata, an orientation space was created for family members and for assigned caregivers of people with CI and D. The active participation of caregivers caused the space to be installed as a specific educational proposal and it was decided to make it open to the community at the School of Psychology, via the Extension Secretariat.  The orientation space for the assigned caregivers, that was called GOC (Caregiver Orientation Group), was then opened and caregivers of people suffering from CI and D attended.\r\nObjectives\r\nTo guide the practice in the care of people with cognitive disabilities and dementias. To acquire effective management of behavioral symptoms in different dementia, cognitive deficit management and efficacy in communicating with the patient.\r\nMethods\r\n Weekly meetings in workshop mode with work plan analysis, caregiver stress monitoring and cognitive-behavioral management strategies.\r\nResults\r\n The GOC proposal, that was developed during 2014-2015, gave more value to caregivers activity. Due to its impact, it led to the creation of the “Caregiver of Dependent Older Adults” course that was developed by EUO UNLP in 2017-2018 with a high number of graduates. This encourages responsible practice in caring for the elderly with CI.\r\nConclusions\r\nTaking into account the demographic change and the prevalence of cognitive impairment, it is essential to have quality alternative educational practices with specific contents that guide the good practices of caregivers.",

      "title": "Long-Standing Psychiatric Features as the Only Clinical Presentation of Vanishing White Matter Disease",
      "abstract": "Vanishing white matter disease (VWMD) is an autosomal recessive leukoencephalopathy caused by mutations in any of the five genes (EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5) that encode the subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), which is essential for protein synthesis (1).VWMD clinically ranges from antenatal or early infantile onset with poor outcome (2) to adult onset with slow progression, where the age at onset is a strong predictor of disease course (3).Affected individuals typically have normal early development, followed by neurological deterioration triggered by stress-provoked episodes of rapid decline.Patients with adolescent or adult onset are more likely to exhibit cognitive problems at the time of or shortly after the disease onset.However, psychiatric disorders have been rarely reported as the only symptoms at the time of diagnosis (3-7) and usually are followed by neurologic manifestations within a few years (6).In women, VWMD can present as ovarioleukodystrophy, a condition in which leukodystrophy is associated with primary or secondary ovarian failure (2, 3).While this could help in reaching a diagnosis in females, the diagnosis in adult males may be challenging, given the possible atypical onset and insidious clinical course.VWMD is a recognizable disorder on brain MRI, usually characterized by diffuse and symmetric white matter T 2hyperintensities and progressive white matter rarefaction.The latter is a hallmark of the disease, both in pediatric-and adultonset cases (7).EIF2B5 is by far the most commonly mutated gene among adults with VWMD, with the recurrent c.338G.A(p.Arg113His) mutation accounting for the majority of adult cases (6), while c.260C.T(p.Ala87Val) is a founder EIF2B3 VWMD mutation in the French Canadian population of Quebec (8).Here, we present the case of an adult male who presented with only psychiatric symptoms for more than 20 years before occurrence of the typical neurological symptoms and deterioration of VWMD.",

      "title": "Psychiatric causes of behavioural change in adults less than 65 years old",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mr. Leow, aged 64 years, presents to the polyclinic with a memo from his nursing home stating 3 months of behavioural change. He was observed to have been cleaning his environment excessively, inexplicably even climbing onto the roof in the middle of the night to clean. His restlessness and the ruckus made by him disturb the other residents of the nursing home, and his nurses are finding it difficult to supervise him.WHAT IS ALTERED BEHAVIOUR? Altered mental state is a broad presenting complaint used to describe abnormal consciousness, cognition or behaviour.[1] In the older population, delirium, specifically a fluctuation in orientation and attention in an ill elderly person, is a main consideration. In the slightly younger adult population of less than 65 years of age, altered mentation can vary greatly in presentation, severity and underlying cause. Acute behavioural change is a subset of altered mental state and does not involve diminished consciousness or awareness.[1] There is no fixed definition. Instead, behavioural changes are usually reported deviations from the patient's baseline and behaviour generally accepted as appropriate according to cultural norms. These can be in the form of psychomotor agitation, changes in personality, bizarre actions, heightened or decreased energy and others.[2] Most represent either an organic or psychiatric condition, but all warrant expedient and thorough medical evaluation. There are wide-ranging organic and psychiatric aetiologies causing behavioural changes in adults (Appendix). For the purpose of this article, we will focus on common psychiatric conditions causing altered behaviour. HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? Patients with severe and acute changes in behaviour and mental states present more commonly to the emergency department or psychiatric services than primary care clinics.[2] Primary care physicians may encounter patients with subacute presentations or behaviour that is less disruptive to daily life. There is no data documenting the prevalence of behavioural changes presenting to the primary care clinic. There is, however, high prevalence but underrecognition of mental disorders presenting to primary care,[345] resulting in delayed diagnoses and a significant duration of possible untreated psychiatric disorder.[6] This is juxtaposed to the fact that primary care clinics remain the preferred setting patients with mental disorders first seek help from,[357] making it all the more necessary for family physicians to differentiate psychiatric conditions from organic causes. WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? History and examination As much as possible, corroborative history should be obtained.[8] Physicians often pick up valuable clues from patients' or, in this case, caregivers' observed accounts of the presenting complaint. In an otherwise broad and ill-defined presentation, contextual clues from the caregiver's accounts help to narrow differentials. A reliable third party's observations will also facilitate objective comparison between the patient's baseline and the current pathological behaviour.[9] Helpful questions include the following: What was the behavioural change observed? Was the onset sudden or gradual? Are there intermittent or fluctuating symptoms? Was there a precipitating event? What perpetuates the behaviour and what alleviates it? What has the progress been since? What was the patient's baseline mental state, behaviour, personality, cognition and function like? Severity can be assessed by the degree of disruption to the individual's function, in terms of activities of daily living, occupation and interpersonal relationships. Risk of self-harm and/or harm to others needs to be assessed to decide the need for emergent hospital or psychiatric facility admission. See Box 1 for the suggested criteria for referral to the emergency department.Box 1: Criteria for referral to emergency department.For all patients, a set of vital signs should be recorded and neurological and mental state examinations performed. Where there is suspicion, examination of appropriate systems based on pertinent history should be carried out, for instance, examination for bruising, cataracts, abdominal striae and supraclavicular fat pads for Cushing's syndrome in patients with history of exogenous steroid ingestion (see Appendix for the list of organic causes). Although not diagnostic by individual components and many organic conditions may result in similar mental status presentations, the mental state examination (MSE) offers invaluable clues to diagnosis[210] and completes the evaluation. See Figure 1 for the suggested algorithm for evaluation in a clinic. Primary care physicians ought to be familiar with the components of the MSE. For instance, a blunted affect, evidence of self-neglect, hallucinations or paranoia support diagnosis of psychosis, whether primary or secondary to organic causes.[11] Inattention may be present in substance abuse, mood disorders or schizophrenia. Observations of speech and behaviour are helpful – disorganised speech or paucity of speech occurs in psychotic conditions or depression, word-finding difficulty in dementia and pressured speech in mania or thyrotoxicosis.[10]Figure 1: Suggested algorithm for evaluation in clinic. ANA=anti-nuclear antibody, ED=emergency department, ESR=erythrocyte sedimentation rate, FBC=full blood count, HIV=human immunodeficiency virus, LFT=liver function test, TFT=thyroid function test, UFEME=urine full examination and microscopic examinationApproach Due to time constraints in the clinic setting, a concise and clear approach to evaluating the patient with behavioural changes is necessary. Clinicians may follow the algorithm below to decide on disposition. Patients who are clinically stable with manageable behaviour and who do not urgently require inpatient investigations can continue to be evaluated in the clinic. Basic blood tests ought to be performed before attempting to attribute the behavioural disturbance to psychiatric origins.[5912] Where there is clinical suspicion, tests for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, or antinuclear antibody and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for systemic lupus erythematosus can be performed.[8] WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? One should bear in mind that oftentimes, longitudinal follow-up and observation of the patient's progress over time is necessary for the diagnosis to be reached. Revisitation of the patient's presentation and further corroborative history may be needed to revise diagnoses as patient's symptomology evolves. When diagnoses are not clear-cut or when the initial treatment is ineffective, specialist consult should be sought. Psychiatric differentials See Table 1 for various psychiatric differentials and their featuresTable 1: Psychiatric differential diagnoses to changes in behaviour in adults less than 65 years old.Late-onset schizophrenia Although generally diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood, there is a significant proportion of patients, estimated to be 23.5% from one study,[3] whose symptoms of psychosis only present later in life, after 40 years of age. Patients with late-onset (defined as onset after 40 years of age) or very late-onset (defined as onset after 65 years of age) schizophrenia differ from their younger counterparts in that they have more positive than negative symptoms. Among positive symptoms, the prevalence of complex visual, tactile and olfactory hallucinations, paranoid, persecutory and partition delusions is higher than that of thought disorders and disorganisation.[11] These patients also tend to be female and have better premorbid function and prognosis.[1112] In primary care, there are often a myriad of non-specific prodromal symptoms that result in frequent primary care attendances many years before the diagnosis of psychosis is made, suggesting that there is room for earlier identification of at-risk individuals. These range from a variety of somatic complaints, mood-related symptoms and changes in behaviour, such as impaired personal grooming, social withdrawal and odd behaviour, to the more obvious changes in perception.[6] Psychotic symptoms are commonly associated with depression, anxiety, substance abuse[8] and other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, autoimmune conditions and chronic lung disease.[6] Very late-onset psychosis is further associated with sensory deficits such as vision or conductive hearing loss.[311] These comorbidities ought to be explored and treated where possible. Undiagnosed bipolar disorder Bipolar disorders are frequently missed or misdiagnosed as depression in primary care.[413] Depressive episodes are frequently the first presentation of bipolar disorder, with episodes of extroversion and increased energy unrecognised as manifestations of mania or hypomania. Certain behavioural changes can be subtle, such as frequent changes in jobs, legal trouble in the past or recurrent depression not responding to antidepressants.[13] With increasing prevalence of depression being managed in primary care[4] and the use of antidepressants as monotherapy being contraindicated in mania, every patient suspected to have depression should be screened for bipolar disorder. Frontotemporal dementia Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is another condition underrecognised in primary care, often resulting in significant delays in diagnosis. There are three variants of FTD: behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), semantic dementia and progressive non-affluent aphasia. Although distinct, all three conditions overlap in inappropriate behaviour, emotional blunting, loss of insight and relatively preserved memory and visuospatial ability. Behavioural changes in bvFTD occur insidiously over months with decline in social conduct, apathy, disinhibition and poor impulse control manifesting as unwanted sexual advances, hoarding, roaming and hyperorality.[14] As with other major neurocognitive disorders, there must be a deterioration in baseline function, whether interpersonal, occupational or daily function, for FTD to be diagnosed. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease, anti-cholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated in the treatment of bvFTD due to preserved cholinergic function[1415] and may, in fact, worsen the behaviour. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid antagonists show limited efficacy. Instead, treatment is usually targeted at relief of symptoms and management of behaviour. Take-Home Messages Patients with psychiatric conditions frequently present to primary care, either for prodromal symptoms long before their symptoms manifest or when their behavioural change becomes noticeable by caregivers. A high index of suspicion and thorough evaluation are needed to avoid missing the diagnosis. Corroborative history from a caregiver or family member is crucial in establishing the nature of the complaint, as it provides a reliable picture of the patient's baseline behaviour. Organic conditions, including drug causes, ought to be evaluated first in changes in behaviour before psychiatric diagnoses can be made. These may require extensive organic work-up, for which a referral to the emergency department for admission is indicated. Late-onset schizophrenia is an important diagnosis to consider, especially if there are complex hallucinations, delusions preceded by prodromal symptoms. Concomitant mood disorders, substance abuse, sensory loss and chronic medical conditions ought to be evaluated and treated in patients with possible psychosis. All patients presenting with depression ought to be also evaluated for bipolar disorder to prevent misdiagnosis and wrong treatment. FTD should be considered when there is a decline in cognitive function with apathy, poor impulse control or deterioration in interpersonal relationship. Closing Vignette Due to disruptive behaviour, Mr. Leow was eventually admitted to an acute hospital for work-up. He underwent toxicology studies, further blood tests, a lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. All tests were negative, except for uniform atrophy of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Further cognitive testing showed frontal lobe dysfunction and moderate cognitive impairment. With an impairment in judgement, impulsivity, lack of insight and an absence of hypomania features, Mr. Leow was eventually diagnosed with FTD. He was discharged after all investigations were complete, initiated on a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor and given outpatient specialist follow-up on his behaviour.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

The proportion of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with new-onset seizures is estimated at 26%. Acute symptomatic seizures are referred to as provoked seizures, situation-related seizures, and reactive seizures. These are seizures that occur in close temporal relationship to a documented brain insult or at the time of an acute systemic insult. Epilepsy is a tendency toward unprovoked recurrent seizures and is the most common reason for seizure occurrences in the hospital. Most seizures that occur in adulthood are focal seizures that arise from disrupted lobar or hemispheric function. SE is the most feared complication for patients with seizures (PWS) because recurrent seizures and SE are more difficult to suppress than single seizures and can be life-threatening, especially when they occur as a primary complication of a neurological or organ system disease.",

      "title": "How sexuality is affected and managed in patients under antipsychotic drugs",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a prevalent side effect of antipsychotic drugs (AP), and it impairs patients’ quality of life. Because of the distress caused by it, it should be borne in mind when prescribed since it is responsible for treatment nonadherence or discontinuation. SD affects about 45- 80% of males and 30-80% of females that take it. In SD, all phases of the sexual response cycle may be compromised. Objectives This non-systematic review of the literature aims to better understand the antipsychotic-induced SD and its management to better compliance of AP-treated patients without compromising their quality of life. Methods A semi-structured review on PubMed linking SD as a side effect of AP drugs. Results All AP drugs can cause SD. It seems related to their mechanism of activity at receptors D2, 5-HT2, α1, H1, and M, which are also involved in sexual function. They do it by diminishing arousal, decreasing libido by blocking motivation and reward system and orgasm indirectly, provoking erectile dysfunction by vasodilatation, and decreasing woman lubrification. Hyperprolactinemia is a significant cause of sexual dysfunctions. Haloperidol, Risperidone, and Amisulpride (prolactin elevating AP) are more likely to cause SD than Olanzapine, Clozapine, Quetiapine, and Aripiprazole (prolactin sparing AP). Although psychotic disorders (Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders) can impact sexual functioning, according to evidence, there is no denying the role of AP in this issue. Aripiprazole, a D2 partial agonist, has been associated with lower rates of SD and seems to reduce the rates of SD in patients previously treated with other AP. Other AP with the same potential dopamine agonist activity, such as Cariprazine and Brexpiprazole, can probably have the same effect. The management of SD induced by AP drugs should include measuring serum prolactin and modifying risk factors like hypertension, smoking, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia. In that regard, waiting for spontaneous remission, reducing the dose of the AP prescribed, or switching to Aripiprazole are all viable strategies, if possible. Although the evidence supporting the addition of symptomatic therapies is weak, adding dopaminergic drugs (amantadine, bromocriptine, cabergoline) or drugs with specific effects on sexual functioning (such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors or yohimbine) may be helpful in selected cases. Conclusions Although all AP drugs can cause sexual dysfunction, it is difficult to determine its true prevalence accurately. AP-induced sexual dysfunction can adversely affect compliance and is one of the factors that must be considered when selecting treatment. In summarizing, Aripiprazole has shown to be the AP with the most favorable profile concerning SD. Cariprazine and Brexpiprazole, being also D2 partial agonists, may cause less SD.

This chapter presents an overview of its definition and assessment, clinical symptoms, epidemiology, natural history, risk factors, and treatment. CS is found worldwide and has a lifetime prevalence of 5.8% in the U.S. general population. The disorder occurs mainly in women, has an onset in the late teen years or early 20s, and appears to be chronic or recurrent. Subjects with CS are preoccupied with shopping, experience pre-purchase tension or anxiety, and have a sense of relief following a purchase. CS is associated with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders. The disorder tends to run in families with mood and substance use disorders. There are no standard approved treatments. Medication studies have produced mixed results, but cognitive behavioral treatment models appear promising.",

Although the prognosis of the nerve injuries after local anesthesia is favorable, it might cause prolonged problems such as dysesthesia. The lingual nerve is a single fascicle at the level of the lingual among 1/3 of patients and more movable during regeneration compared to the inferior alveolar nerve after the injury. As a result, the lingual nerve is more vulnerable and has poorer outcomes. More vigilant clinical considerations are required to the lingual nerve injury after local anesthesia. Generally, more than 80% of cases are spontaneously resolved within 2 weeks after the local anesthesia even without any specific treatment. However, the patient having long lasting abnormal sensations more than 2 weeks needs specialists' care for further assessment. In case of dysesthesia which is a symptom of neuropathic pain, immediate referral to specialists is mandatory.

This is a case of a 21 year old female, unmarried, who presented to our OPD with prominent psychotic symptoms, particularly a fixed belief that she was being followed by someone for the last six years. Her elder sister, who was close to her emotionally also developed persecutory delusion of similar content within one year of its onset in the younger sister. Thus when they first presented to the OPD, both sisters had similar type of psychotic presentation. After separation of both sisters, psychotic symptoms improved in elder sister within one month. CONCLUSION: Shared Delusional disorder is not uncommon. The risk of induced delusion is more among those who have high emotional bonding and it disappears following separation of each other. So it is necessary to evaluate the family member of individuals suffering from psychiatric disorder to rule out Induced delusional disorders. The conceptual issues of the problem are also discussed.",

      "title": "ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SILEXAN IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY ANXIETY SYNDROMES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Anxiety and depressive diseases represent leading causes of burden worldwide with a globally increasing prevalence and suffering [1]. Although the heterogeneous clinical presentations do not always fully meet the criteria required for a diagnosis of a full-blown psychiatric disease as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the so-called “subthreshold” or “subsyndromal” severity consistently showed a long-term negative impact on general health, life quality and functionality, and hence a decreased working capability in the affected individuals [2, 3]. For both, subsyndromal as well as full-blown manifestations, beneficial clinical effects on anxious, depressive, psychosomatic and cognitive symptoms and favorable safety profile lacking pharmacological interactions, undesirable sedation, withdrawal symptoms, or abuse potential were repeatedly confirmed for Silexan in patients with primary anxiety syndromes [4, 5]. Additionally, in-vitro studies indicated stimulation of synaptic plasticity, and in rats repeated administration of Silexan decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test [6]. Aims &amp; Objectives Based on the available clinical and preclinical international evidence, the pharmacological profile suggests that Silexan, a proprietary active substance produced from Lavandula angustifolia Miller flowers that has been approved in many countries for the oral treatment of anxiety disorders, may also have an antidepressant effect [6]. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on data from placebo- controlled clinical trials with Silexan at a daily dose of 80 mg [7]. Methods The present meta-analysis investigating comorbid depressive symptoms was conducted based on five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials performed with Silexan in subthreshold anxiety (n = 3) and generalized anxiety disorders (n = 2) [7]. Results The results of the item depressed mood assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale clearly showed that Silexan has a beneficial effect on co-occurring depressive symptoms in these patients [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 315 patients suffering from mixed anxiety and depressive disorder [7]. Silexan was significantly superior to placebo regarding the antidepressant efficacy measured with the Montgomery Å sberg Depression Rating Scale as well as the anxiolytic efficacy measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [7]. Discussion &amp; Conclusion Based on these encouraging results and the need for an antidepressant agent with a beneficial efficacy and tolerability profile lacking unfavorable pharmacological interactions or withdrawal symptoms harming the quality of life, especially in patients with milder forms of depression [4, 7, 8], the antidepressant efficacy of Silexan is currently being investigated in an international randomized placebo-and reference-controlled phase III trial in patients with a mild to moderate major depressive episode (EudraCT Number: 2020-000688-22).

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

      "title": "Emotional Aspects of the Respirator Care of Patients with Poliomyelitis",
      "abstract": "Summary A study is reported of a group of patients with respiratory paralysis resulting from poliomyelitis and necessitating care in a special Respirator Unit. Although the nature of the illness, the consequent handicaps, and the special form of treatment appear to exercise a definite influence on the adjustment of the individual patient, the personality structure prior to the illness seems to be the most important single determinant in this regard. Other variables, such as the age level or level of psychosexual development at the time of onset of illness, immediately antecedent experiences, the meaning of the illness in terms of punishment or castration as well as possible secondary gain, the attitudes of parents or relatives, and cultural factors such as the stigma of dependency and socioeconomic pressures appeared as well to play significant roles. In spite of individual variations, a consistent pattern of reaction to the illness exists, varying in degree but little in nature. Regression, a common phenomenon in any illness, is marked and is fostered by the almost absolute physical dependence of the patients. Infantile mechanisms of adaptation such as denial, projection, and the use of primitive fantasy are used to cope with anxiety. With normal sexual outlets abolished, pregenital forms of gratification assume prominence. In accepting reality, patients go through one or several periods of depression of varying intensity, often followed by irritable and demanding behavior. Attitudes of family, and of staff as family surrogates, are especially important at this time, as patients tend to interpret illness as punishment for primitive instinctual impulses. Tolerance to and mechanisms of handling of dependence vary widely in different patients, with greater conflicts apparent in those who had experienced difficulties in adaptation prior to illness. The ease of weaning a patient from the tank respirator or from any other form of respiratory aid appears to be intimately connected with his current emotional state, his personality structure, and with the attitudes of the ward personnel. Intercurrent happenings on the ward tend to assume the proportion of \"crises,\" and often seem to produce relapses, both physical and emotional in nature. Preliminary studies have shown significant interrelationships between respiratory function and emotional state. More detailed studies in this area are being organized on a multidisciplinary basis. Material is discussed regarding the attainment of optimal attitudes and techniques of management by ward personnel. Preliminary conclusions in relation to the type of psychiatric techniques most appropriate for such patients are summarized. Psychotherapeutic procedures seem to be of value in: Handling anxiety, furthering acceptance of disability by patients, and promoting healthy striving towards independence within the limits imposed by the disease; Fostering more constructive attitudes toward patients by families through discussion of feelings, particularly guilt and resentment; Helping ward personnel to operate more effectively through understanding the patients' needs and their own reactions to the patients. Observations on group behavior and patient-staff relationships are reported. The need for further investigation is stressed, with particular regard to the acute phases of illness and the adjustment of patients following discharge.",

      "title": "Men's Health: Male Sexual Dysfunction.",
      "abstract": "Human sexual function is complex and multidimensional, with physiologic and psychological components. The common sexual dysfunctions in men have significant overlap. Low sexual desire in men includes a lack of interest in thinking about sex or in being sexual, alone or with a partner. Sexual health counseling often is helpful. Physicians should prescribe supplemental testosterone only if it is clearly indicated. (Sexual dysfunction is an off-label use of testosterone.) Supplementation is not beneficial for men with a normal total testosterone level. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the consistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain a penile erection sufficient for sexual satisfaction. The cause typically is multifactorial. The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are the first-line pharmacotherapies for most patients with ED. Their use is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates. Peyronie disease is an acquired penile abnormality that causes curvature or other deformities of the erect penis. Premature ejaculation is defined as a lack of ejaculatory control that is associated with distress. All pharmacotherapies for premature ejaculation are used off label. First-line treatment options include daily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, paroxetine), on-demand clomipramine, and topical penile anesthetics. Psychotherapeutic and physical therapies also have been shown to be effective.",

Probably because of methodological difficulties inherent in assessing this complex phenomenon, even the most commonly assessed outcome variables have produced contradictory results, with the exception of leaving or desiring to leave the psychologically abusive relationship. Some of the significant findings require more corroboration due to the small number of studies addressing them. The relative role of physical abuse in relation to psychological abuse has yet to be disentangled. Mediator/moderator variables are likely extremely important for explaining why particular consequences do not consistently result from psychological aggression. Although the hypothesized consequences/outcomes seem appropriate for further study, the most significant contribution may lie in intensive investigation of long-term, enduring psychological abuse that produces major personality and affective shifts in the recipient.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the DSM-IV recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioral symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical and/or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric and/or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in close reciprocal relationship with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond the conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other nonantidepressant treatments, or the more extreme interventions that eliminate ovulation altogether, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option for this population. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that the SRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

      "abstract": "Selective mutism is a communication disorder of the child, defined as the persistant inability to speak in one or more social situations whereas the child is capable of understanding language and of speaking in other situations. This trouble is generally extra-familial and mainly concerns girls. Until recently, it was considered to be rare but is, in fact, quite probably under-diagnosed. It often begins before the age of five and several years may elapse before it is identified and treatment is begun. It can be symptomatic of quite a number of diverse personality organizations which must be considered before it is possible to offer a prognosis and the appropriate treatment. Many psychopathological hypotheses exist to explain the origin of this complex disorder. Several factors have been associated with it such as difficulties in the mother/child relationship, separation anxiety, immigration, a psychological traumatism, the notion of a family secret, and more recently, social phobia (or, more generally, anxiety troubles). The prognosis of this disorder is reserved, depending essentially on the underlying psychopathological structure, the precocity of the diagnosis and treatment, the family psychopathology and possible associated troubles such as intellectual deficiency, psychomotor or language developmental delays. To obtain the best chances of success, treatment must be global (including the child, his family and teachers) and « multi-modal », associating individual therapy (analytic and/or cognitive-behavioral type), family therapy and pharmacological treatment (if the component of anxiety seems to be massively present).",

A detailed patient history, focusing on specific inquiries about recent boat or ship travel, is crucial for a timely diagnosis. The syndrome is unique in that reintroducing similar movements, such as driving, swinging, or returning to the boat, alleviates symptoms temporarily. We describe the case history of a 28-year-old male who experienced a persistent illusion of ground movement for six months following a fishing expedition. The patient reported alleviated symptoms when re-exposed to movements such as driving or swinging. The patient had undergone extensive medical workups and imaging tests under multiple physicians before being diagnosed with MdDS. MdDS is a commonly misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, unreported, and unrecognized condition.

Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a relatively common form of psychotic disorder (severe mental illness). Its lifetime prevalence is nearly 1%, its annual incidence is about 10-15 per 100 000, and the average general practitioner cares for 10-20 schizophrenic patients depending on the location and social surroundings of the practice. It is a syndrome with various presentations and a variable, often relapsing, long term course. Although schizophrenia is publicly misconceived as \"split personality,\" the diagnosis has good reliability, even across ages and cultures, though there is no biochemical marker. Onset before the age of 30 is the norm, with men tending to present some four years younger than women. Clues as to aetiology are tantalising, and management remains endearingly clinical. Evidence for a genetic cause grows stronger: up to 50% of identical (monozygotic) twins will share a diagnosis, compared with about 15% of non-identical (dizygotic) twins. The strength of genetic factors varies across families, but some 10% of a patient's first degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) will also be schizophrenic, as will 50% of the children of two schizophrenic parents. Premorbid abnormalities of speech and behaviour may be present during childhood. The role of obstetric complications and viral infection in utero remains unproved. Enlarged ventricles and abnormalities of the temporal lobes are not uncommon findings from computed tomography of the brain. Thus, a picture is emerging of a genetic brain disorder, enhanced or brought out by subtle forms of environmental damage.

The general features of frontal lobe seizures are outlined in the introduction. Sixteen video-EEG sequences involving 10 different patients are shown. A short presentation of the clinical history precedes each case report. The electroclinical characteristics of seizures implicating the frontal lobe are extremely variable. According to the literature, general characteristics allowing differentiation between seizures of different topography include: appearance of seizures in clusters; seizures predominantly nocturnal or while the patient is falling asleep; short duration of each episode (approximately 30 s); abrupt onset and end; relatively short post-ictal phase, when present; frequent secondary generalization and falls; frequent subjective sensations, usually difficult to describe; impairment of consciousness is not a constant feature; episodes of status are frequent; differentiation from pseudo-seizures may prove to be difficult. When confirmation of the epileptic nature of paroxysmal phenomena is needed, video-EEG recordings may be of some help. Possible subjective manifestations are: cephalic and neuro-vegetative (even epigastric) manifestations, as well as pensee forcee, fear, olfactory hallucinations, non-lateralized visual disturbances. Motor manifestations include tonic, dystonic, postural, oculocephalic deviations and falls. Verbal and more often gestural automatisms can be complex, very brief and often violent, but elementary automatisms, such as automatic hand and mouth movements, or bimanual and pedaling movements, are also frequent. In this video teaching course, we first present seizures featuring minimal motor signs, followed by seizures with a more complex semiology. The most significant clinical and EEG features are discussed. (Published with videosequences.)",

Men are more disturbed by a conflict mobilizing therapy than women are. The strongest decrease of men's psychic symptoms can be found in the year after their therapy. Women's defence against psychic problems is less strong than men's. Decrease of women's symptoms can be found during therapy already. Character neuroses don't make psychic and/or psycho-somatic symptoms in a direct manner. Character neuroses rather give rise to conflicts with other people, and stress by those conflicts cause symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

It discusses the epidemiology, aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical features and prognosis of psychosexual and sexual problems and the links with gynaecological disease. Dyspareunia can be primary, where pain has always occurred, or secondary, where it occurs after a period of pain-free sexual activity. The aetiology of dyspareunia should be viewed on a continuum from primarily physical to primarily psychological, with many women exhibiting components of both. Psychosexual problems may present to the gynaecologist as part of general history taking for a variety of presenting complaints, and it is sometimes difficult to disentangle how much of the gynaecological complaint is due to the psycho-sexual problem, or whether the gynaecological problem has caused the psychosexual issue. It is extremely important that the clinician feels comfortable asking about sexual problems, especially in relation to gynaecological problems, for which there is a good chance of concomitant psychosexual issues, such as vulval disorders and dyspareunia.",

      "abstract": "A seizure is defined as the clinical manifestation resulting from an excessive and abnormal discharge of a population of neurones. The individual lifetime risk of developing a non-febrile seizure is about 5% and around a third of patients will experience further seizures and be diagnosed as having epilepsy. When assessing a possible first seizure, assuming that the patient has recovered and is not in an emergency situation, the first question is whether the paroxysmal event was a seizure. There are many seizure imitators, some of which can be fatal if missed. These include cardiac syncope due to arrhythmias, valvular abnormalities or ischaemia, hypotension, hypoglycaemia and TIAs. Ultimately, the diagnosis of a seizure is clinical and is best established by taking an accurate history. An accurate description of the paroxysmal event is paramount. So the patient should ideally bring a witness to the consultation, allow the clinician to contact a witness by phone, or provide a written description of the paroxysm. Further features to be established include type of seizure (generalised or partial) and timing (early morning or nocturnal). The past medical history should be probed for previous syncopal events or possible seizures. Once a putative diagnosis of a seizure has been made, the second question is whether the seizure was provoked or not. Examination should include assessment of the level of consciousness and orientation, and the cardiovascular and nervous systems. In the patient who has fully recovered from a first seizure NICE recommends measuring plasma glucose, and electrolytes including calcium, and a 12-lead ECG. Referral to an emergency department for urgent neuroimaging and lumbar puncture should be considered if the patient has not fully recovered, and/or if risk factors are present. If the patient has fully recovered, guidelines recommend referral to a first seizure clinic for review by an epilepsy specialist.",

      "title": "Sex Hormones and Psychic Conflict a Case Report*",
      "abstract": "The present report has been directed to outlining the factors which influenced the sexual adaptation of a male castrate. The interplay of the treatment situation, reality situation, and inner conflicts, constituted the frames of reference. Intensive psychiatric interviews combined with a relatively lengthy replacement therapy schedule were carried out. In viewing the trajectory of the patient's experiences throughout the observation period, it is evident that during the early periods with androgen there was a definite increase in sexual pace over and above his usual capacity during the last few years, particularly since castration. With the progression of treatment there was a decrease in the effective sexual expression of the patient which required explanation. The following comments are offered in explanation of the mechanisms which underlay the reduction in sexual activity. Following castration, an alteration in the endopsychic conception of the individual takes place. The intensity and extent of this alteration is variable, essentially unconscious, but may also be consciously expressed. The castration may incline the individual to a femininized conception of himself. This is corroborated by the patient's dream material, especially those dreams dealing with the transference. The transference dreams revealed the emergence of a relatively powerful sexual conflict, i.e., the wish to be taken sexually, and also the repudiation of that wish. Since the homosexual conflict is more intense, there will be a concurrent intensification of the patient's hostility toward father-figures, because, by virtue of the homosexual orientation, the patient's passivity is increased. Since passivity is a challenge to the patient's security as well as to the cultural tradition of being virile, it will naturally produce an aggressive response which may or may not be conscious. In this instance, the major display of aggression was seen in the transference dreams and was directed against the physician. The sex hormone pushes the individual into greater sexual activity. It induces him to follow a path more or less consistent with his basic personality patterns in line with the modifications induced by castration. Through the introduction of a more prominent feminine component due to castration, hormonal pressure will intensify the patient's sexual conflicts, i.e., being somewhat more “feminine,” he has a more severe struggle against his passive cravings. He may, therefore, be unable to cope adequately with sexual tension, because of his increased passivity. Thus, we see that after the castration, hormonal treatment may operate eventually to interfere with effective sexuality. It follows that the patient's altered ego attitudes must be worked through before hormones are too freely administered. An effort to analyze carefully the negative transference attitudes was not made in this patient, as, in the main, the psychiatrist took the part of an observer. But, ideally, neglect to analyze such material would appear to be one of the most serious technical oversights for the success of treatment. The next problem is the effect of the wife's illness and her unattractiveness. This may legitimately disturb the patient's heterosexual expression, and since he is married and not completely equipped sexually, the difficulties of an extra-marital affair are quite real. In support of the greater prominence of inner conflict over the external factors, one must realize that the patient, though married, did not hesitate previously to have relationships with women to his own satisfaction, if he wanted them seriously enough. Hence, the weight of evidence tends to throw the balance in the direction of inner conflict and altered ego attitudes. One must also bear in mind that in the last year the patient's attitude toward his wife improved considerably when his own sexual interests became less strong, along with the elimination of the hormone. Thus, although the administration of the male sex hormone temporarily produced a period of sexual rejuvenation, probably capable of repitition, it became evident that the patient's most effective psychic equilibrium was maintained after the discontinuation of hormonal therapy.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of undesirable reactions following lumbar puncture is not uncommon. The incidence has been variously reported as ranging between 5 and 75%.1A prominent feature of the postlumbar puncture reaction, and often its only manifestation, is headache. This symptom usually appears 12 to 24 hours after the puncture, though it may occur in a few hours or may be delayed for several days. Characteristically, the headache is relieved when the patient lies down and becomes accentuated when the patient either sits or stands. In most cases the headache persists for several days, but occasionally it may last for as long as eight weeks. Various explanations have been given for the appearance of the headache, and various factors have been noted that will modify or prevent it. Some observers have felt that postlumbar puncture headache is psychogenic2and that its incidence is greater in persons known to be neurotic.3Other investigators, dealing primarily with psychiatric patients, have stated that the incidence of",

      "title": "Managing drug-induced psychosis",
      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

      "abstract": "www.thelancet.com Vol 386 August 29, 2015 835 Major depression is a leading cause of disability and burden of disease worldwide, resulting in a range of negative outcomes to individuals, families, and society. Initial symptoms of depression typically arise in adolescence, although depression is generally not treated until later in life, if at all. Although both sexes suff er from depression, prevalence in women is roughly double in women during child-bearing years compared with men. The course of depression is variable but usually relapses and follows a worsening pattern over repeated episodes and can end with suicide. Depression during pregnancy or post partum (perinatal depression) is one of the commonest complications of pregnancy; it is reported in 10–15% of women in high-income countries, with a higher prevalence in low-income and middle-income countries. Depression during pregnancy has been associated with poor prenatal care, poor nutrition, substance misuse, self-harm, and possibly preterm birth and low birthweight. Post-partum depression has been associated with poor child health, poor parenting, emotional dysregulation, delays in the child’s physical, social, and cognitive development, and behavioural problems. Depression aff ects not only the mother and infant but also other children in the family, the mother’s partner, and society as a whole. However, depression is not the only perinatal mental health problem; anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, substance misuse, personality disorders, and schizophrenia can also occur and result in adverse pregnancy, maternal, and child outcomes. Although increasing attention has been paid to perinatal depression over the past two decades, perinatal mental health in general remains a neglected global public health problem.

This condition is one of the most common sexual problems for men and increases with age, but it's not a natural part of ageing. Approximately one half of men aged 40 years and older have erection problems. Most men have difficulty achieving an erection from time to time, and such occurrences are considered normal. However, ED may be a regular and more severe problem in some men. It can cause low self-esteem, performance anxiety, depression and stress, and may also affect the quality of a marriage or intimate relationships. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, participating in more exercise, stopping smoking and minimising the risk of heart disease, may help to improve the condition. The introduction of the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of ED. Surgery may be considered when these inhibitors and other approaches fail or are contraindicated.",

      "abstract": "Most head injured patients arrive in the accident and emergency (A&E) department within a few hours of the injury. This article concerns the investigation of a group that has received less attention: those whose first attendance is delayed, who reattend, or develop complications after a period of observation. Delay in the initial presentation or unplanned return to the A&E department after head injury can occur for a variety of reasons. The abuse of alcohol or drugs may lead to signs of an injury being noted only after the patient wakes up or is found still in coma long after the effects of the agent should have cleared. Sometimes seemingly trivial injury leads to attendance some hours, days, or even weeks later because of persisting or worsening symptoms. Studies in South Africa, England, and Scotland' showed that about 2-3 % of A&E patients reattend after being sent home with an apparently minor head injury (only 0.2% of the total new A&E attenders). Most of these have responded to advice given at the time of discharge and have developed symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or vomiting prompting reattendance within two weeks of the injury. In Scotland in 1979 the annual incidence of an intracranial haematoma undergoing surgery was shown to be 4.5 per 100 000 population.4 Data from a regional neurosurgical unit indicate that one fifth of these are pure extradural haematomas and over two thirds are intradural haematomas, which is the commoner finding at all stages after injury. A report in 1980 showed that over one quarter of surgical intracranial haematomas received surgery after three days (table 1).5 This pattern may have changed with the increased use of computed tomography but intradural haematomas (subdural and intracerebral) still tend to present later than extradural haematomas. Patients with chronic subdural haematoma (a subdural collection of dark fluid occurring at three weeks after injury or later) reach neurosurgical units at the annual rate of one per 100 000 population.6 7",

OAB may be idiopathic or may occur with other common conditions such as bladder outlet obstruction, neurological disease, or stress incontinence. Primary care physicians may safely diagnose this condition by history and physical exam with a minimum of widely available lab tests. Management with behavioral therapies and pharmacotherapy is generally quite successful and warranted. Multiple anticholinergic medications are available and have been shown to be effective. Subtle differences in structure and mechanism of these agents may yield improved therapeutic benefit or tolerability and thus it is reasonable to try more than one drug to achieve the optimal results. For patients that fail behavioral and initial pharmacotherapy or when other complicating conditions are identified, referral to a specialist is indicated; however, the majority of patients with OAB do not require cystoscopy or urodynamics. Successful treatments for OAB do exist and it is worth screening for these disabling complaints at the primary care level.",

Shared psychotic disorder (SPD) is a rare clinical phenomenon and has been reported in only a few cases of individuals diagnosed with BD. Furthermore, reports concerning SPD being induced by substance use or withdrawal are lacking. We report the case of a married couple endorsing simultaneous psychosis, a form of SPD. The primary case (the wife) had a diagnosis of BD, without any history of psychotic episodes before the current episode, while the secondary case (the husband) had a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. Both individuals were misusing prescribed synthetic opioids, and their psychosis was most likely induced by a withdrawal state. Cases of SPD involving patients with BD have rarely been reported. Considering the high rates of dual diagnoses among patients with BD, clinicians should be aware of the risk of substance-induced psychosis among these individuals and the manifestation of these psychotic episodes. This case report strengthens previous reports suggesting that SPD is a clinical entity that can occur not only in situations where the primary case involves an individual diagnosed with delusional disorder or schizophrenia, but that it may also occur when the primary case has a diagnosis of BD.",

This article focuses on the experience of the diagnostic process as narrated by individuals who were under the age of 50 when diagnosed. Analysis of in-depth interviews with 17 individuals with Parkinson's disease inductively reveals a 'detecting stage', a period during which they visit different doctors, undertake many examinations and experience bodily symptoms with impacts on their mental health. The diagnostic process, which usually lasts over 2 years, often leads to misdiagnosis and or late diagnosis (a) on account of the individual's young age and social meanings attached to it, usually by doctors, whose discourse appears to be rather psychologised and (b) is perceived as disruptive to individuals' biographies.

Severe mental illness can be 2 to 3 per 1000 Postpartum psychosis can be 1 to 2 in 1000 COVID times has seen an increase in depression and anxiety in the perinatal period(Wang 2020,Wu 2020) Psychosis can re-emerge or be exacerbated during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Although response to treatment is good, these problems frequently go unrecognized and untreated in pregnancy and the postnatal period. Psychiatric relapse in the setting of medication discontinuation for pregnancy is extremely common. Hence an appropriate treatment plan for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy and lactaction needs to be individualized and protocolised. Domestic violence during the perinatal period is recognised as major public health issues (Buist et al. 2005) and are associated with poor outcomes for women and their children and partners(Murray et al. 2003).It also contributes to increased risk of mental illness in pregnancy and lactation Intervention studies indicate that mental health problems during the perinatal period can be minimised if women and families engage in appropriate service (Armstrong et al. 2002; Kemp et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2006). However concerns with regards to knowledge gaps and safety issues in prescribing psychotropic medication exist. This symposium by the Perinatal Psychiatry Task Force will address the important area of perinatal psychiatry ie prescribing of psychotropics in pregnancy and lactaction.The format will be discussion of the same with illustrative cases.",

This chapter considers counter-transference separately for the two sexes. Towards the female patient the analyst has a latent predisposition to experience all the feelings and impulses that he directed on to his mother during the oedipic phase. Towards the male patient, also, we find, under certain circumstances, a position corresponding to the positive Oedipus complex.

Maintenance and restoration of sexual function, of which pregnancy is a consequential part, is a goal of neurological rehabilitation (1). In practice, however, professional attention to the sexual problems of people with disabilities (and perhaps in women with disabilities in particular) is often inadequate, delayed or non-existent. When undertaken, an assessment must take sensitive account of a patient's history, personality and social setting. It may be difficult to return to a pre-existing relationship following the acquisition of physical disability. For example, following a brain injury there may be personality change, unstable mood, and fatigability. Following a spinal injury there will be a change or loss in mobility, sexual responses and sensory functions. New sexual and relationship problems may not resolve spontaneously with time, and may become entrenched and unmanageable unless addressed expertly and appropriately in a timely way.",

Dentro de este grupo, la esquizofrenia ha sido una de las más estudiadas en su epidemiología, observando una prevalencia de vida cercana al 1%, con importantes variaciones entre los países [1]. El único estudio de prevalencia poblacional de trastornos mentales realizado en Chile, durante la década de los 90’, encontró una prevalencia de vida para psicosis no afectivas de 1,8% y una prevalencia de últimos 12 meses de 0,7% (estimaciones puntuales) [2].

B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pain is a sensation following tissue damage or a sensory experience expressed in terms of tissue damage (International Association for the Study of Pain). In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

      "abstract": "The depressive character is characterized by perpetual and unsuccessful efforts to maintain self-esteem and to avoid a sense of helplessness. Such individuals suffer from chronic depression which may or may not be masked, but which permeates their character. Although the condition is among the commonest seen in many of our clinics and practices, it remains without a generally accepted diagnostic form. It is suggested that the essential, clinical, dynamic, and structural features of the depressive character are: (1) consistently low self-esteem and a sense of helplessness, dependent object relations and chronic guilt; (2) self-directed aggression and masochism are frequent but not invariable; (3) extensive use of the mechanism of denial is as common as the previously described obsessional defenses seen in patients subject to psychotic depression; (4) often the depressive character suffers from intense oral envy; (5) depressive character traits may help to ward off any of the basic anxieties, namely, object loss, loss of love, castration anxiety, and superego anxiety (guilt) (6) the depressive character may be similar to a number of related disorders, namely, the obsessional character, hysterical characters with a large oral component, and depressive borderline states; (7) sensitivity to loss, sadness, and fragility of self-esteem makes the depressive character especially vulnerable to regression into overt depression; (8) the persistence of oral incorporative mechanisms, ambivalent, dependent object relations, ego versus superego tension with depressive affect, and sensitivity to loss are characteristic of the ego of the depressive character.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

      "title": "Psychic time as occasion for enactment",
      "abstract": "The author focuses on enactments in the temporality of the analytic process, taking place around analytic breaks. Being part of the rhythm of psychoanalysis, breaks can be experienced as disruptions, with increased anxiety. Threats to the integrity of the frame provide points of vulnerability and challenge to containment that may result in enactment. This is especially so when related to the patient's unique psychic time, touching on depth of disturbance that is unmetabolised and cannot find verbal expression. Enactments are discussed as representations of unconscious material, to be contained retrospectively by analytic thinking, at specific points of the patient's psychic readiness. Only after an \"unthought-out action\" on the part of the analyst does he/she become alive to it. Guilt and shame are often experienced following enactments. These feelings can be utilised for understanding the enactment events and their underlying affects, in the intersubjective arena, potentially furthering the analytic process. A clinical illustration is presented of a mental enactment combined with a disruption to the frame around a break, which coalesced with the patient's internal unique timing. Being an expression of the patient's unconscious readiness for transformation, the enactment is understood as occasioned in the conjunction between psychic time and analytic time frame.",

      "title": "Agitación postoperatoria en niños, influencia del agente anestésico",
      "abstract": "La agitacion postoperatoria (AP) se ha descrito como una alteracion mental durante la recuperacion de la anestesia general consistente en alucinaciones, llanto incontrolable, confusion, intranquilidad y movimientos fisicos involuntarios1. Es mas frecuente en ninos, y generalmente es un fenomeno autolimitado. A pesar de ello, es considerada como una complicacion importante por su alta incidencia (10-50%, y hasta un 80% segun algunas series)2,3, por el riesgo que tienen estos pacientes de autolesionarse, y las repercusiones que puede tener en la Unidad de Recuperacion Postanestesica (URPA).\r\nHay diferencias en la literatura en cuanto a la incidencia de AP, y la etiologia tampoco esta clara. Influyen factores relacionados con el paciente, el procedimiento quirurgico, el anestesico y la medicacion concomitante utilizada4. Se desconocen tambien las implicaciones psicologicas de la AP en ninos, algunos estudios sugieren que estos ninos tienen mayor riesgo de desarrollar comportamientos negativos en el postoperatorio5.\r\nNuestro proposito ha sido analizar la incidencia de AP, mediante la escala Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale (PAED), en pacientes pediatricos sometidos a anestesia con sevoflurano o desflurano para procedimientos de cirugia mayor ambulatoria (CMA), la influencia del agente anestesico utilizado y otros factores de riesgo asociados, asi como sus consecuencias. Tambien se analizaron los posibles cambios de comportamiento que podian desarrollar estos pacientes en el postoperatorio.\r\nCon este objetivo, tras aceptacion por el Comite de Etica e Investigacion Clinica (CEIC) del Hospital Universitario La Paz HULP, se ha realizado un ensayo clinico randomizado. Un total de 200 pacientes fueron aleatorizados a recibir anestesia con sevoflurano o desflurano. Ademas, 71 pacientes fueron premedicados con midazolam y a 78 pacientes se les suministro una dosis de propofol.\r\nLos datos obtenidos confirman una incidencia de AP global en nuestro estudio de 21.30%. La incidencia e intensidad de AP disminuyen con el tiempo, reduciendose a la mitad pasados 15 min tras el despertar de la anestesia. Los principales factores de riesgo encontrados han sido: la edad menor a 5 anos (a medida que aumenta la edad 1 ano se reduce la probabilidad de tener AP un 41%), el dolor postoperatorio, y la ansiedad preoperatoria; destacamos el efecto protector de una dosis de propofol durante la induccion anestesica, pues reduce la incidencia y la intensidad de la AP. El desflurano disminuye la incidencia de AP frente al sevoflurano, pero no de forma significativa. Sin embargo, la AP producida por el desflurano es cualitativamente distinta a la del sevoflurano. El tiempo de despertar fue menor con desflurano que con sevoflurano. En nuestro estudio, la AP no afecto al tiempo de estancia en la URPA, si bien estos pacientes tuvieron consecuencias (perdida de via venosa, etc.) y algunos precisaron terapia farmacologica para su control. Por ultimo, un 22% de los pacientes presentaron cambios de comportamiento tardios, cambios que no estaban relacionados con la AP.\r\nPara reducir la incidencia de este efecto adverso es necesario identificar los pacientes en riesgo y adoptar medidas preventivas, como reducir la ansiedad preoperatoria, eliminar el dolor postoperatorio, y administrar una dosis intraoperatoria de propofol.",

      "title": "At risk for pain : pain-related anxiety, cognition, and processing biases",
      "abstract": "Pain is a well recognizable and familiar experience to all human beings.In most cases, pain takes the form of an acute episode that temporarily disables individuals in their daily functioning, and that cures spontaneously within a short period of time, or after effective medical treatment has taken place.Nevertheless, there is a substantial part of the population that has to contend with daily recurrent pain complaints for a prolonged period of time.Although the prerequisite for pain duration has been debated, there is now general consensus that pain complaints lasting longer than three months can be considered 'chronic'.Apart from chronic pain complaints originating from evident physical or organic causes (e.g., cancer pain), a considerable part of the chronic pain patients suffers from non-specific pain complaints.That is, they experience pain even though no objective or somatic cause can be detected, or they suffer from persisting pain complaints after the somatic cause has been effectively treated.Non-specific chronic pain is predominantly localized at the musculoskeletal system, affecting the lower back, the lower-and upper limbs (knee, elbow, leg), the neck, and the shoulders (Kerssens, Verhaak, Bartelds, Sorbi, & Bensing, 2002; Verhaak, Kerssens, Dekker, Sorbi, & Bensing, 1998).An epidemiological study in a Dutch community sample demonstrated that about 75% of the general population indicates to have experienced pain at the musculoskeletal apparatus in the past period of twelve months.Moreover, for 45% of this group, these pain complaints persisted for longer then three months (Picavet & Schouten, 2003).In another study, examining the prevalence of low back pain and associated disability in the Belgian population, 41,8% of the respondents indicated to have experienced low back pain for at least one day in the past period of six months.Moreover, for 8,2 % of this group, low back pain was seriously impeding daily functioning (Goubert, Crombez, & De Bourdeaudhuij, 2004).Although the group of chronic patients constitutes a relatively small proportion of the general population (5-10 %), this group is responsible for a large proportion of health-care costs and levels of work absenteeism in western societies (e.g., Waddell, 2004).In addition, chronic pain is known to have an enormous impact on the personal and social relations of the individual in pain (Morley & Eccleston, 2004;Sullivan, Adams, & Sullivan, 2004).Given the detrimental effect of chronic pain on the individual and his or her surrounding, research into the factors and mechanisms that contribute to the aetiology, the persistence, and the effective management of chronic pain complaints has known a significant boost in the latest decades.This burgeoning research interest has amongst others resulted in the identification of a number of psychological factors and mechanisms that may predispose persons toward, or conversely protect them against the development and persistence of chronic pain complaints.The current thesis contributes to this line of research by zooming in on the specific contribution of some of these proposed vulnerability and resilience factors.Consequently, the main and overall objective of this thesis is to add to the understanding of factors, mechanisms, and processes that constitute a mediating or moderating role in pain and pain-related disability.Before introducing the exact research questions of this thesis, this first chapter will start with a brief overview of some of the most prevalent theoretical models of pain as they have been formulated throughout history.Next, the theoretical background against which this thesis has been conducted will be presented by introducing some central concepts and factors underlying the studies in this thesis.Last and concordantly with the outline of this thesis, the main research questions of the individual studies in this thesis will be presented.",

      "title": "Experimental models for the investigation of brain ischemia",
      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

Regarding duration, ILAE defines convulsive SE as bilateral tonic–clonic lasting longer that 5 minutes, and absence and focal status epilepticus as exceeding 10 minutes. Children compared to adults are more prone to epileptic seizures and as a consequence to SE, mainly due to age related maturational imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic mechanisms. The classification into generalised or focal, convulsive and nonconvulsive differ widely in aetiology, management and outcome. Early prehospital intervention with appropriate protective measures and emergency medication of seizure disorder, may prevent perpetuation of seizure recurrence.

      "title": "[Parasomnias].",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are frequent. They usually represent either the exaggeration of a physiological phenomenon (e.g. sleep starts) or a non-disturbing, idiopathic and usually benign sleep disorder (e.g. sleep talking and bruxism), which need only counseling and improvement of sleep hygiene. However, occasionally parasomnias are of clinical relevance. They can cause insomnia or hypersomnia (e.g. 'myoclonus nocturnus'), psychosocial stress (e.g. sleep-related enuresis and sleep walking) and injuries to oneself and others (e.g. REM-parasomnia). Finally, they can be symptomatic of neurological and medical disorders (e.g. sleep paralysis and 'myoclonus nocturnus'). In these cases special investigations including video-polysomnography can establish a correct diagnosis and allow a specific treatment.",

Curiously enough, compared with other functional symptomatology, somehow this disturbance has been neglected in literature until now. Urologists, surgeons, and internists have more difficulties than psychiatrists to find out that distinct emotional conflicts and especially unsatisfactory sexual adjustment might have contributed to the development of recurrent or chronic urinary retention which they vainly tried to explain by organic findings. Of course the fact that extensive medical evaluations or even surgical procedures revealed no abnormality except the stout urinary bladder never is suifficient to qualify for \"hysterical disease\". Every diagnosis has to be established on positive grounds. Hypothetic explanations of mysterious syndromes by supposing more \"microscopic\" and thus undetected morphological deficiencies and changes as the crucial cause of a disease never should become the protective trick by which a physician avoids confrontation with his patients' psychological problems.",

The author suggests that syndromatic terms for this type of child abuse are outmoded and should be abandoned in favor of an exact description of the suspected abusive behaviors in child dependency courts. Should there be a finding of abuse, the offending parent should be evaluated in terms of the major dynamics of her medically abusive behavior. Such evaluations should be utilized in the dispositional phase of child abuse proceedings and not employed for the proof of the matter.",

La exploración física debe descartar aquellas causas agudas que requieren una intervención urgente: fiebre y rigidez de nuca, para descartar meningitis; heridas o golpes en la cabeza, para descartar origen traumático o focalidad neurológica, que indicarían lesión en el sistema nervioso central. Si el cuadro clínico de la convulsión orienta a un cuadro no epiléptico, debe valorarse la posibilidad de un cuadro vasovagal o de un síncope cardiogénico que hayan causado una hipoxia cerebral. Si se confirma clínicamente la convulsión sin causa claramente identificable, se debe sospechar la posibilidad de que el paciente padezca epilepsia y se trate de un primer episodio convulsivo que debe valorar un médico con experiencia.

      "abstract": "Any stimulus (intrinsic or extrinsic) that triggers a biological response is known as stress. Stress can exert various negative effects on the body ranging from alterations in homeostasis to life-threatening effects and death. Erectile dysfunction can be a manifestation of chronic stress. ED is the most common male sexual dysfunction that affects 10-25% of middle-aged and elderly men. ED may result from many etiologic factors like psychogenic, endocrino- logic, neurogenic, arteriogenic or venoocclusive dysfunction. These factors are not mutually exclusive and multi- ple factors contribute to ED in many patients. According to modern science Psychogenic factors frequently coex- ist with other etiologic factors and should be considered in all cases. A patient aged 35 years came to the OPD of A&amp;U Tibbia college with complaints of inability to initiate and maintain erection along with abnormal vision, dizziness, retrosternal burning, indigestion, heaviness in chest and disinterest. He was advised for Shirodhara along with counselling (Satvvajaychikitsa) and after a couple of days, there was a significant improvement in pa- tient. In this case study, we are trying to highlight the contribution of stress &amp; psyche on male sexual dysfunction and its management through Satvavajaychikitsa (counselling) and Shirodhara.

Patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures frequently are misdiagnosed and treated for epilepsy. Video-electroencephalography monitoring is preferred for diagnosis. From 5 to 10 percent of outpatient epilepsy patients and 20 to 40 percent of inpatient epilepsy patients have psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. These patients inevitably have comorbid psychiatric illnesses, most commonly depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, other dissociative and somatoform disorders, and personality pathology, especially borderline personality type. Many patients have a history of sexual or physical abuse. Between 75 and 85 percent of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are women. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures typically begin in young adulthood. Treatment involves discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in patients without concurrent epilepsy and referral for appropriate psychiatric care.

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

      "abstract": "Many varieties of psychiatric and psychological treatment have been touted as effective for the paraphilias, which are disorders of sexual behavior requiring unusual or bizarre imagery or acts for sexual excitement. Hormonal alteration of sexual arousal with anti-androgens, particularly Medroxyprogesterone Acetate {MPA), has gained popularity in the last two decades. MPA results in a reversible, dose-dependent reduction in plasma testosterone, with a concomitant reduction in sexual fantasy, arousal, and per formance. Side effects and complications are minimal. Medication is one component in a comprehensive treatment plan which is designed to deal with the patient's medical, social, family, and psychological problems. Implications of the paraphilias and their treatment for the family are discussed. The mental health professional may be confronted at times with sexual problems which have social and legal ramifications as well as clinical ones. Among the most challenging of such sexual problems to treat are the paraphilias. After a referral of the paraphiliac patient to the mental health professional occurs, a decision must be made about what form of treatment can be offered to the patient. Consideration must also be given to prevention of recurrence of the presenting sexual problem. Medroxy progesterone acetate is one possible treatment for the paraphilias which has been gaining in popularity in recent years. Generally there has been little sociological interest in the paraphilias and their treatment despite obvious profound and disruptive effects upon marriage and the family.",

Objectives It is proposed, through a clinical case, to know the characteristics of this disorder, evolution, differential diagnosis and therapeutic possibilities Methods 62-year-old male, history of harmful alcohol consumption and a previous admission to a psychiatric short hospitalization unit for self-injury (superficial cuts in the context of severe mental illness of his wife) post-transplantation who is required by ideas of death, anhedonia and lack of collaboration in patient, The day before the evaluation, refusal to take oral treatment, selective mutism. Pre-transplant evaluation where no psychopathological alteration was observed. Results What is initially assessed and treated as a confusional episode of inactive type, through a correct psychopathological examination and with subsequent continuous interviews, with mood fluctuations throughout the admission, is subsequently oriented as an acute stress disorder, adaptive reaction with an anxious-depressive component and finally concluding that we are facing a dissociative disorder, highlighting the depersonalization/derealization on a dysfunctional personality base. Conclusions Characteristic of depersonalization is the great difficulty in describing symptoms, the feeling of being disconnected from one’s own body, emotions and reality. The latest studies on etiopathogenesis with MRI show an inhibitory response on the limbic system by hyperactivation of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as well as a decrease in the autonomic response, the initial result being the attenuation of the processing of emotions. Among the differential diagnoses: post-anxiety illness disorder, major depressive episode, other dissociative disorders, panic disorder, psychotic disorder, substance-induced disorder There are several partially effective treatments, although the results so far are poor. SSRIs, quetiapine and naltrexone have been tried. Partial efficacy with lamotrigine together with SSRIs and, if high levels of anxiety coexist, SSRIs together with clonazepam. There are studies where psychodynamic psychotherapy, behavioral therapy and hypnosis have obtained partially effective results. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

Temporal theta bursts, or the \"sawtooth\" pattern, come and go between 27 and 32 weeks' CA. Delta brushes attain their maximum about 32 to 34 weeks' CA and disappear about 40 to 44 weeks' CA. Frontal sharp transients have their peak occurrence at 35 or 36 weeks' CA and are still present at 44 to 48 weeks' CA. The background activity is essentially symmetric but transient patterns are less symmetric and frequently asynchronous. Lack of variability in the record is abnormal after 34 weeks' CA. Responses to isolated light flashes are prominent from very early prematurity through full-term. On the other hand, photic driving is frequent in early prematures (29-32 weeks' CA), but it then declines and is difficult to detect in the full-term neonate. Nonspecific responses to stimulation occur from early prematurity. Sleep--waking cycles are clearly discernible about 37 weeks' CA. Active sleep (rapid eye movement) goes from 60% at 34 weeks' CA to the 25% of adulthood at about 8 months of age. The EEG of the full-term newborn has four patterns, corresponding to three states: the low voltage irregular for wakefulness, high voltage slow and tracé alternant for quiet sleep, and the mixed for either wakefulness or active sleep.",

      "abstract": "Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) is a common condition with a significant impact on quality of life and general health. A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

      "title": "Ictal video‐electroencephalogram of breath‐holding attack",
      "abstract": "Breath-holding attacks (BHAs) are non-epileptic paroxysmal events that affect 0.1% to 4.6% of infants from 6 months to 5 years of age.1 Their frequency peaks at about 2 years of age and reduces by 5 years. The detailed description of the event is the key point for the diagnosis: the child typically emits a short loud cry, followed by breath holding, cyanosis, rigidity or limpness and transient loss of consciousness for a few seconds. Then, an inspiration marks the resolution of the spell.1 The BHA are considered rare before 6 months of age, although they have been reported in the neonatal age.2 BHA might be a frightening experience for parents, but its course is known to be benign.1 Some patients have severe and frequent BHA up to five times per day, so their management can be complicated, especially when occurring under 6 months of age. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is used in specific cases to exclude tonic epileptic seizures.3 Since the age of 1 month and half an infant presented, usually during crying, episodes of apnea with cyanosis, and hypertonia, sometimes followed by hypotonia, pallor, loss of consciousness and finally sleep. For this reason, at 2 months of life, he was admitted to the hospital where physical, neurologic and cardiologic examination, brain ultrasound, standard EEG, blood cell count, serum ferritin level and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no abnormalities. The infant was discharged with a diagnosis of BHA and a cardiorespiratory monitor was suggested. His medical history was remarkable for obstructive apnea due to gastroesophageal reflux disease and mild congenital laryngomalacia. His mother's history was unremarkable, except for exposure to a stressful event during pregnancy since, at 20 weeks of gestational age, fetal ultrasound showed shortness of long bones, suggesting a possible congenital disease. This event increased the anxious state of the mother already greatly upset by COVID-19 pandemic issues. However, the suspicion of congenital disease was ruled out. After discharge from the hospital, these episodes increased in intensity and frequency up to five times per day becoming so alarming that the patient was admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Ambu bag ventilation was used during the episodes. The mother was frightened, fearing for the infant's life, so her capacity to console him was reduced. A long-term video EEG (vEEG) (Video S1) was performed, recording a typical event and demonstrating the non-epileptic nature of the paroxysmal event. After vEEG, resuscitation procedures with Ambu bag were stopped during the episodes and reassurance and psychological support was offered to the parents. In the following days, episodes decreased to 2 per day. Iron supplementation and piracetam 40 mg/kg divided in two daily doses was prescribed and in the following weeks the situation further improved. At 8 months of age he presented a normal development, BHA are still present although with minor manifestations, that the family has learned to manage. Background EEG was normal: the awake EEG activity was represented by continuous theta activity with normal voltage and symmetrical distribution and sleep non-REM pattern was characterised by theta-delta activity with physiological spindles, without slow nor epileptiform abnormalities. Following an emotional trigger, the infant cried, and tachycardia was registered (180 bpm from basal 140 bpm) for a few seconds (Video S1). He remained for 30 s in a forced expiration status with crying facial grimace, cyanosis and opisthotonic posturing. Cerebral activity at EEG, 13 s after the breath holding, showed diffuse slow-wave in the delta band with no epileptic discharges, and polygraphy marked severe oxygen desaturation with SpO2 going down to 53% (Fig. 1). Then, relative bradycardia (100–110 bpm) was recorded before an inspiration act and hyperpnea followed for 3 s. A ‘syncopal’ phase lasting 10 s occurred: the infant became pale, floppy, with loss of consciousness and no motor reaction in response to external stimuli; in this phase, the EEG presented slightly increased delta activity while oxygen saturation was still low (Fig. 2). Relative tachycardia followed and progressive normalisation of EEG correlated with clinical recovery and voluntary movements. Finally, the baby fell asleep, and a typical normal sleep EEG pattern was recorded. BHA is commonly reported above the age of 6 months, but it should be considered also below this age, as this case and few other published cases demonstrate.2 EEG is usually not needed for the diagnosis, but it could be useful when the semiology is unclear.3, 4 In a study by Low et al.,3 on 129 children with BHA aged 7 months–11 years, a normal interictal background EEG activity during wake and sleep was usually found. In their study, they registered only one patient during a BHA episode: a 13-month-old girl who during the attack at EEG showed slow activity ‘such as occurs in anoxia and with stupor from various causes’.3 No polygraphy or video was performed at that time. In addition to this, descriptions of ictal EEG are very rare. As we show during the BHAs EEG initially shows a slowing of the background activity and, as bradycardia deepens, further slowing of the cerebral activity manifests. As the consciousness was regained, the background EEG rapidly returned to normal.4 We provide an interesting video EEG with polygraphy providing insights on the pathophysiology of BHA. At first, the breath-holding is associated with cyanosis and oxygen desaturation causing EEG slowing (brain manifestation of hypoxia). Further electrocortical slowing then appears together with pallor, bradycardia and syncope, suggesting that hypotension (during the pale skin phase) probably had an additive role in the worsening of EEG slowing. The heart rate up-down variations observed at the ECG seems to reflect a sympathetic activation shifting toward a parasympathetic activation before reaching a homeostatic phase of clinical recovery. These findings resemble the phenomenon of vaso-vagal syncope, since the contemporaneous recording of both EEG and ECG during the episodes was consistent with these cardiovascular episodes.5 Interestingly, patients with BHA in adult life present vaso-vagal syncope more frequently than the control population.6 Moreover, this recording shows that the distinction between cyanotic and pallid BHA is not exclusive, as a pallor phase may follow a cyanotic phase. BHA are known to have a benign prognosis with a reduction in the frequency of episodes and a spontaneous remission before adolescence, with no neurological consequence.6 However, an increased predisposition for syncopal attacks and concentration problems were also reported.6 In a single article, not confirmed by other studies, some authors reported a slight increase in the plasma level of S-100B protein (related in other studies to brain injury) in a group of BHA patients in comparison with a control group,7 without evidence of a clinical meaning of this finding. Future studies would be required to clarify this point. In line with other studies,8, 9 we acknowledge the possibility that psycho-educational interventions could improve the parents' mental wellness.10 Our main message is that a vEEG monitoring with polygraphy (oxygen saturation, respiratory effort, ECG) to record the BHA episode should be early considered in cases with frequent or severe events and uncertain diagnosis to obtain objective evidence of BHA for physicians and families. This diagnostic approach in those peculiar cases may facilitate clinical management, early reassuring families and providing the appropriate interventions, possibly avoiding repetitive hospitalisation, unnecessary investigations or admission to ICU (causing a high cost), as in our patients before reaching a sure diagnosis thanks to the vEEG monitoring. Informed consent was obtained from the subject legal representatives involved in the study. The authors would like to thank the patient and his family for their cooperation. This work was developed within the framework of the DINOGMI Department of Excellence of MIUR 2018–2022 (legge 232 del 2016) and received support from the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente for 2021) at Fondazione IRCCS Ca′ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico. Video S1: At the beginning the baby is crying: cerebral activity at EEG shows diffuse theta-delta activity, normal voltage; tachycardia is recorded (140–190 b/m). At 0:03 he stops crying and for 30 s maintains forced expiration, facial grimace, moves arm and legs. At 0:26 cyanosis appears, followed by opisthotonus posture and behavioural arrest (0:37): cerebral activity at EEG shows diffuse slow waves in the delta band, and polygraphy shows relative bradycardia (100 b/m) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) decrease till SpO2 53%. At 1:09 progressive clinical recovery occurs with respiration and spontaneous movements regain, EEG normalisation, relative tachycardia and SpO2 100%. In the end the baby falls asleep.

      "title": "Hiccups as a myocardial ischemia symptom",
      "abstract": "A hiccup is involuntary, paroxysmal inspiratory movements of the chest wall associated with diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle contractions, with the synchronized closure of glottis. The mechanism underlying this common primitive reflex plays an important role in protecting airways against esophageal aspiration. The hiccup reflex mechanism is based on the afferent pathway (vagus and phrenic nerve and sympathetic fibers innervating chest organs, the abdomen, the ear, the nose and the throat stimulation, and the stimulation of hiccup center in the central nervous system, mainly reflecting psychogenic or metabolic disorders) and the efferent pathway (phrenic nerves). An incidental hiccup is a common problem, usually resolves spontaneously and does not present a clinical issue. The clinical issue arises in the case of pathologic persistent hiccups or symptomatic secondary hiccups which may lead to significant fatigue, insomnia or depression. Generally, pathologic hiccups are associated with considerable discomfort concerning both the \"stigmatized\" person and his or her personal surroundings in which it evokes different emotions, from amusement through impatience to uneasiness and the suggestion of a medical visit as an expression of concern for a given person. The most common causes of pathologic symptomatic hiccups are nervous system diseases, either the central nervous system (proliferative, angiogenic, inflammatory disorders), or the peripheral nervous system: the irritation of the phrenic nerve (proliferative disorders, goitre) and the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, enteritis). The vagus nerve irritation with subsequent hiccups may be caused by chest disorders (injury, surgery) and heart diseases (myocardial infarction). In the present paper we describe the case of a 62-year-old male with recurrent hiccups associated with exertion as a secondary symptom of myocardial ischemia.",

The frequent association (46 percent of the cases) of this syndrome to a neuroblastoma (usually thoracic) makes it very particular from the etiological point of view.

Healthcare providers have also increasingly appreciated the impact that adverse effects of treatment can have on quality of life, as well as on compliance with and the effectiveness of treatment. Many functional impairments and adverse treatment effects take the form of clinical complaints that patients and caregivers typically report to their healthcare providers without prompting. Other adverse effects are not so obviously clinical or treatment-related, and patients may not be inclined or may even be reluctant to bring them up when talking with the provider. Impairment of sexual function is a problem of this kind. Sexual dysfunction appears to be common and frequently underrecognized in certain patient populations. For example, it has been estimated that 25% to 63% of women and 10% to 52% of men with epilepsy have some form of sexual dysfunction, yet in clinical reviews of sexual disorders, epilepsy is not listed as one of the medical conditions commonly associated with impaired sexual function.",

      "abstract": "Cervical myelopathy is referred to in many ways in the English literature, for example, as cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), spondylotic radiculomyelopathy (SRM) or degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). In addition, more frequent occurrences are noted in older adults and to a greater extent in men. The causes of the effects of cervical myelopathy may be the appearance of lesions on the spinal cord, ischemia due to compression of the vertebral artery and repeated micro-injuries during maximal movements—hyperflexion or hyperextension. It is well known that lesions on the spinal cord may occur in a quarter of the population, and this problem is clearly noted in people over 60 years old. The symptoms of SCM develop insidiously, and their severity and side (unilateral or bilateral) are associated with the location and extent of spinal cord compression. Neurological examination most often diagnoses problems in the upper limbs (most often paresis with developing hand muscle atrophy), pyramidal paralysis in one or both lower limbs and disorders in the urinary system. To make a diagnosis of CSM, it is necessary to perform MRI and neurophysiological tests (such as EMG or sensory and/or motor-evoked potentials). The use of appropriately selected scales and specific tests in diagnostics is also crucial. This narrative review article describes the latest knowledge on the diagnosis and clinimetrics of cervical spondylotic myelopathy in adults and provides future directions.",

      "title": "Flares of chronic pelvic pain syndrome: lessons learned from the <scp>MAPP</scp> Research Network",
      "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is one of the unresolved problems in urology. There are multiple recommendations for the management of CPPS, and the BJUI guideline of guidelines on bladder pain syndrome by Malde et al. 1 summarizes differences in nomenclature, definitions and recommended diagnostic tests and treatments between major national and international guidelines. CPPS is defined according to the European Association of Urology as chronic or persistent pain perceived in structures related to the pelvis without proven infection or other obvious local pathology that may account for the pain, and it is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual and emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract, sexual, bowel, pelvic floor or gynaecological dysfunction 2. Despite exacerbations of CPPS symptoms, so-called 'flares' (i.e. sudden appearance or worsening of symptoms) that highly affect the patients' quality of life and strongly challenge their treating physicians, relevant characteristics of CPPS such as frequency, intensity, duration and risk factors are largely unknown. In this month's issue of the BJUI, Sutcliffe et al. 3 bring light into this darkness and present their findings from the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network. A total of 385 participants were eligible for participation in their 1-year, multi-site longitudinal study. Symptom flares were very common, with approximately three-quarters of the sample reporting at least one flare (23% reported one flare, 28% two to three flares and 25% four or more flares), flare duration ranged widely from 1 to 150 days, and variability in symptoms, frequency, and duration was very relevant both between and within participants. Risk factors for greater flare burden (greater flare frequency, symptom intensity and/or duration) were female gender, worse non-flare symptoms and bladder hypersensitivity or chronic overlapping pain conditions. These new insights into the characteristics of CPPS close several gaps in our knowledge, but also raise many questions. What are the reasons that one-quarter of patients with CPPS did not experience flares and what can we learn from this specific subgroup to optimize our treatment strategies? What are the pathomechanisms involved? Can we use biomarkers to identify patients at risk of CPPS flares? Would there be protective factors to obviate CPPS flares? How can we optimize the management of CPPS flares to improve the quality of life of affected patients? Despite these many questions, there is light at the end of the tunnel: the aforementioned MAPP Research Network (www.mappnetwork.org). This network, established by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health in 2008, is a whole-body initiative which has enormously expanded our knowledge in the field of CPPS in recent years. Such research networks, unifying highly multidisciplinary approaches through the collaboration of scientists, epidemiologists and clinicians, are essential to push the borders of knowledge, paving the way for novel management strategies. Together we are strong, with basic and clinical research linked by translation and reverse translation enabling innovations and finally resulting in better patient care. However, although a customized, patient-tailored bio-psycho-social approach engaging the patient in a collaborative journey towards self-management is strongly recommended and generally accepted for CPPS 4, flares remain a major issue. We still have to solve this Gordian knot; however, per aspera ad astra! The next steps are to prevent flares and to find an optimal flare treatment. None declared.",

Judges and juries carefully investigated and described the forensics of mental health defendants in the court record. Those suffering from temporary mental health issues, often a result of an illness, were examined under this same set of laws. Most often the guilty were remanded into the hands of family or those of a keeper, a type of temporary guardian, or they were sent to gaol (medieval incarceration in jail or prison) while they awaited their pardons. Some were kept in gaol until mentally stable enough to return to society. Those cases not dismissed because of an obvious mental health condition (as those of persons with childlike behaviour from birth might be) followed a pattern of having the defendant found guilty of the crime, and, because of a lack of intent, they were pardoned and not physically punished other than possibly spending time in incarceration.",

      "abstract": "Post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) is a constellation of serious adverse side effects manifested in clinical symptoms that develop and persist in patients during and/or after discontinuing finasteride treatment in men with pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) or benign prostatic hyperplasia. These serious adverse side effects include persistent or irreversible sexual, neurological, physical and mental side effects. To date, there are no evidence-based effective treatments for PFS. Although increasing number of men report persistent side effects, the medical community has yet to recognize this syndrome nor are there any specific measures to address this serious and debilitating symptoms. Here we evaluate the scientific and clinical evidence in the contemporary medical literature to address the very fundamental question: Is PFS a real clinical condition caused by finasteride use or are the reported symptoms only incidentally associated with but not caused by finasteride use? One key indisputable clinical evidence noted in all reported studies with finasteride and dutasteride was that use of these drugs is associated with development of sexual dysfunction, which may persist in a subset of men, irrespective of age, drug dose or duration of study. Also, increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation in a subset of men treated with these drugs were commonly reported in a number of studies. It is important to note that many clinical studies suffer from incomplete or inadequate assessment of adverse events and often limited or inaccurate data reporting regarding harm. Based on the existing body of evidence in the contemporary clinical literature, the author believes that finasteride and dutasteride induce a constellation of persistent sexual, neurological and physical adverse side effects, in a subset of men. These constellations of symptoms constitute the basis for PFS in individuals predisposed to epigenetic susceptibility. Indeed, delineating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PFS will be of paramount importance to the understanding of this syndrome and to development of potential novel therapeutic modalities.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

This behavior is often, but not exclusively, a way for individuals to manage intense emotions, relieve emotional or psychological pain, or punish themselves. Self-mutilation can be observed in various psychiatric contexts, including personality disorders, mood disorders, and psychotic disorders. This psychiatric manifestation, which transcends diagnostic categories, can involve various types of self-harm to different parts of the body, including the genitals, known as Klingsor Syndrome. Inspired by a fictional character from Wagner’s opera, Klingsor Syndrome is a term used to describe extreme cases of self-destructive behavior where an individual, often in a psychotic state, inflicts severe injuries on their genital organs. This syndrome is often associated with psychosensory or intrapsychic hallucinations and delusional ideas occurring within the context of acute or chronic psychotic disorders. Treatment is multidisciplinary, involving surgical repair and rigorous psychiatric follow-up. In this paper, we report the case of genital self-mutilation occurring in a psychotic patient.",

Although depression itself, apart from medication, is generally believed to be associated with sexual dysfunction, the few existing studies report wide discrepancies with regard to frequency, gender, and quality of sexual dysfunction. Loss of libido is frequently and consistently associated with major depression. Moreover, sexual dysfunction secondary to depression or other factors is often mistaken for that caused by antidepressant medication. Although antidepressants have long been associated with sexual dysfunction, the precise nature and magnitude of sexual side effects have not been fully appreciated. This article will review the literature on sexual dysfunction associated with unmedicated depression and offer a guide for the clinician evaluating and treating depressed patients with sexual problems.",

      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

Therefore, it is necessary to do an appropriate general, neurological, and behavioral examination for proper diagnosis and management. A series of four cases who reported to psychiatric outpatient with behavioural complaints and no focal neurological deficits were reported. The most common presentation of SOLs is seizure, headache, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. Along with this complaint, some patients may present with abnormal behavior. However, it is very rare for a SOL to present solely with psychiatric or behavioral complaints.

This syndrome is usually characterized by a young woman with the illusion that a man whom she considers to be of a higher social or professional position is in love with her. Developing an elaborate delusional process about this man, his love, his pursuit and total commitment to the idea. Two forms, pure or secondary, are described. As well as fixed or recurring 52-year-old female patient in outpatient follow-up with a diagnosis of schizophrenia with long-term follow-up, start of follow-up by a new therapist, in this context intensive follow-up is carried out in the event of the appearance of pharmacological secondary effects, pharmacological readjustment is carried out with good results. During the joint follow-up with nursing, the cessation of secondaryisms is confirmed and we are informed of the gradual appearance of overvalued ideas in relation to the new therapist, which are gradually structured in the form of erotomanic delirium that coincides with the cessation of follow-up by said therapist. Consultations in the emergency room occur on a couple of occasions due to mild behavioral alterations secondary to messages and communications that he reports receiving where said love is confirmed. Despite readjustments, there continues to be an increase in clinical symptoms due to abandonment of medication, finally producing serious alterations aimed at the search for said therapist, finally culminating in admission to the acute care unit for containment of said condition. Objectives The objetives is the diferencial diagnosis, in this case symptoms could be classified as positive symptoms of schizophrenia, although it is its own nosological entity. Methods . Results . Conclusions This patient represents a classic example of De Clerambault syndrome and is a faithful expression of the recurrent syndrome associated with delusions of grandeur, eroticism and jealousy.

      "abstract": "Genital self-mutilation is usually believed to be rare and to be predominantly practiced by men, especially those suffering grave mental illness. Castration occupies a central place in psychoanalytical theory, which suggests various symbols for the supposedly diverse fantasy of castration. A review of the literature revealed only about 60 cases. 3 diagnostic categories have been suggested for such cases: schizophrenics, transvestites or transsexuals, and patients with religious and cultural complexes. Factors believed to be common to persons practicing genital self-mutilation include intense sexual confusion, masochistic relationships with and submission to women, strong feminine identification, repudiation of the penis, and depression relieved by the mutilation. Explicit motivations were expressed in over 60% of cases, including desire to be a woman, existence of homosexual sentiments, real or imagined illness, and heterosexual sentiments. Extreme religiosity, psychotic symptoms, and a feeling of failure in the masculine role are often mentioned. 5 patients in 1 series of 53 attempted suicide and 1 succeeded. 87% were considered psychotic. 25% ingested alcohol before the act. 3 characteristics among psychotic subjects suggest a high risk of mutilation: very young psychotic men with sexual obsessions and fears, older men with psychotic depression or grave somatic illness, and men tending to become violent on drinking alcohol. Nonpsychotic subjects tend to display rage against themselves. Nonpsychotic transsexuals often had old fantasies of mutilation, and in 1/5 of cases some previous attempt had been made. A series of 3 cases observed by the author displayed a variety of circumstances: a 23-year old man with no observed psychosis wished to be free of sexual tumult and desire to masturbate for religious reasons, a 42-year old man had a fit of delirium and castrated himself with a saber, and a 32-year old chronic psychotic emasculated himself with his pajama cord and died shortly thereafter. Very few cases of female self-mutilation have been observed.",

The condition may last for hours or days. Patients often find it difficult to share this condition with their health care providers because they are afraid of being diagnosed with hypersexuality and they often get different psychiatric diagnoses such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. Therefore, little is known about the real prevalence, pathophysiology or etiology of Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. In addition, since there is no study conducted in this field, our information in this area is limited to case reports. Although there is no consensus about the treatment of Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder in the psychiatric literature, there are some case reports about the use of pregabaline, clomipramine, duloxetine, clonazepam, varenicline, olanzapine, risperidone in addition to the case reports on treatment with hypnotherapy, pelvic floor physiotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this case report, we aimed to present the detailed description of a successful treatment procedure with duloxetine in a forty two years old female patient diagnosed with Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder.

      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "title": "Misophonie im Kindes- und Jugendalter: Eine narrative Übersichtsarbeit",
      "abstract": "Misophonia in Childhood and Adolescence: A Narrative Review Abstract. Misophonia describes a phenomenon in which the affected children and adolescents show a strong negative physiological and emotional reaction when confronted with specific (misophonic) auditory stimuli (most commonly eating or breathing sounds). Several studies with adults yielded prevalence rates between 6 % and 20 % in various (clinical) samples, but the representativeness of samples was largely limited. More than 80 % of the first manifestation of symptoms occurs during childhood and adolescence. Regarding comorbid disorders, studies show great heterogeneity, with estimates ranging from 28-76 % of comorbid mental disorders and approximately 25 % with comorbid physical disorders. The exact etiology is currently not well studied. Initial neurophysiological explanations and imaging studies point to a specific physiological response in misophonia patients. Although many case reports are now available, and diagnostic criteria and measurement tools have been developed, misophonia currently does not represent a distinct neurological, audiological, or psychiatric disorder in the DSM-5 or ICD-11.Zusammenfassung. Die Misophonie beschreibt ein Phänomen, bei welchem betroffene Kinder und Jugendliche eine starke negative physiologische und emotionale Reaktion bei Konfrontation mit speziellen auditiven (misophonischen) Reizen zeigen (am häufigsten Ess- oder Atemgeräusche). Einzelne Studien mit Erwachsenen liefern bereits Prävalenzen zwischen 6 und 20 % in verschiedenen (klinischen) Stichproben, wobei eine Repräsentativität der Stichproben in den meisten Studien nur sehr eingeschränkt gegeben war. Die Erstmanifestation der Symptomatik liegt jedoch bei über 80 % der Fälle im Kindes- und Jugendalter, weshalb diese Altersgruppe besonders betrachtet werden sollte. Hinsichtlich komorbider Störungen zeigt sich auch eine große Heterogenität mit Schätzungen zwischen 28 bis 76 % an komorbiden psychischen Störungen und etwa 25 % mit komorbiden körperlichen Erkrankungen. Die genaue Ätiologie ist derzeit noch nicht ausreichend untersucht. Erste neurophysiologische Erklärungsansätze und Bildgebungsstudien weisen auf eine spezifische physiologische Reaktion bei Misophoniepatient_innen hin. Obwohl mittlerweile eine Vielzahl von Fallberichten vorliegt, Diagnosekriterien und Messinstrumente entwickelt und erste kognitiv-behaviorale Behandlungsansätze evaluiert wurden, stellt die Misophonie weiterhin keine eigenständige neurologische, audiologische oder psychiatrische Störung im DSM-5 oder der ICD-11 dar.",

In this chapter, some classic histologic findings in acute and chronic poisoning (including substance abuse) are presented. The determination of cause and manner of death in a poisoning requires a careful summation of circumstance, toxicology, and autopsy. Toxicology results are usually necessary, but alone are not sufficient for forming an opinion on cause and manner. Many variables, including postmortem redistribution, post-exposure survival, and overlap between therapeutic and toxic ranges, introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of postmortem drug levels. Gross and microscopic findings at autopsy can be supportive of acute and/or chronic substance abuse or may show unexpected sequelae of chronic substance abuse (e.g., infective endocarditis). Sometimes histology may be the first clue in a case of poisoning. An example of this is finding oxalate crystals in the kidneys of an otherwise unremarkable autopsy, as ethylene glycol is not detected by most toxicology laboratories in routine screening.",

      "abstract": "Up to 85% of young children in industrialized societies have tantrums. Anger peaks early in these outbursts, then declines. Distress/sadness behaviors remain relatively constant across the tantrum, but comfort-seeking accelerates toward the end, perhaps disinhibited by the anger decline. Distress always outlasts anger and can elicit parental comfort-giving, thus repairing social bonds broken by the child’s anger. Developmentally, tantrums become common around 18 months, perhaps reflecting the emergence of a neurodevelopmental program that anticipates struggles around weaning and independent mobility, as in contemporary forager/village cultures. Such a program might involve left hemisphere anger generation and right hemisphere distress. Mean tantrum frequencies range from 1–9/week, decreasing with age. Tantrum prevalence drops below 50% around 5–6 years. Tantrums may lengthen with age, perhaps morphing into adult anger episodes with a variable residue of distress. Tantrum severity increases in many medical and psychopathological conditions; roughly half of child psychiatry admissions involve severe tantrums.",

      "title": "Status epilepticus associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis in children",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen that leads to respiratory tract infections in children, often causing immune-related injuries in multiple other organs and tissues. The involvement of central nervous system has been reported in 5% to 7% of patients with M. pneumoniae infection.[1] The clinical manifestations of M. pneumoniae encephalitis are highly heterogeneous, and more than half of patients experience seizures during the acute phase, with status epilepticus occurring in severe cases.[2] Status epilepticus is a common yet critical illness of the nervous system in children. Although the frequency of M. pneumoniae encephalitis is well recognized, reports regarding this entity in children with status epilepticus are rare. Some scholars have proposed a three-level classification system in which M. pneumoniae encephalitis is diagnosed as follows[3]: (1) highly suspected – positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, with or without positive serological test results, or positive pharyngeal swab culture/PCR results with positive serological test results; (2) suspected – serology positive with negative pharyngeal swab, CSF, and PCR results, or positive pharyngeal swab/PCR results with negative serological test results, and no other infections pathogens; and (3) not excluded – positive serological test results with negative pharyngeal swab, CSF, and PCR results, with at least one confirmed infectious pathogen. This study directly tested M. pneumoniae in the CSF of children with M. pneumoniae encephalitis complicated by status epilepticus, to obtain direct evidence of this infectious agent in the central nervous system. In four cases, satisfactory results were observed following early identification and treatment of M. pneumoniae. All patients were diagnosed and treated early, thus, resulting in good prognosis. This study recruited children who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, from July 2017 to June 2018 and met the diagnostic criteria for acute encephalitis with status epilepticus. In all included patients, the RNA results for M. pneumoniae were positive, whereas the results for viruses, bacteria, and fungi were negative. We retrospectively analyzed clinical characteristics, examination results, treatment strategies, and prognosis of these four children with M. pneumoniae encephalitis complicated by status epilepticus. Clinical manifestation: It included four children, three boys and one girl, aged 3, 4, 5, and 8 years, respectively. Acute onset was observed in all the four cases. The duration of hospitalization at our institution was 14, 4, 7, and 6 days for each patient, respectively. Initial symptoms included fever with a peak temperature of 39°C to 40°C (two to four times per day, irregular). Respiratory symptoms (eg, cough) were noted in two patients, whereas disturbance of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 11–12) was noted in three patients. The remaining patient was unconscious. The type of status epilepticus differed among the four cases. One patient presented with myoclonus secondary to tonic-clonic seizures, one with generalized tonic clonus, one with complex partial seizures, and one with generalized tonic clonus combined with subclinical electronic discharges. Neck rigidity was observed in one patient, whereas the remaining three exhibited no pathogenic neurological signs. Examination results: Lumbar puncture was performed on the 4th, 6th, 7th, and 14th days after disease onset in each patient. The results of routine and biochemical CSF examinations were within the normal range, and no viral antibodies were detected in the CSF. Bacterial culture, acid fast staining, and ink staining results were negative. However, the CSF was positive for M. pneumoniae RNA. Video electroencephalography (EEG) revealed a slow-wave background rhythm of 1.5 to 3.0 Hz in each patient. Slow waves were observed in each hemisphere, and the left and right hemispheres were basically symmetrical. The interictal interval contained multifocal epileptiform discharges. Electrical status was observed in one patient. Three patients exhibited abnormal cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Among these three patients, two exhibited long T1 and T2 signals in the hippocampus, whereas one exhibited demyelination of the paraventricular white matter. No definite abnormalities were observed in the remaining case. Therapeutic response and prognosis: All four patients were treated with azithromycin for 2 weeks (5 days per week). In addition, three of the four patients were treated with dexamethasone, two with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and one with combined IVIG and glucocorticoids. Following treatment, body temperature returned to normal in all the four children. Three children experienced recovery of consciousness. Two children were free of epileptic seizures after treatment, whereas the remaining two took oral levetiracetam and topiramate to reduce seizure frequency. Although slow-wave background activity was observed on follow-up EEGs in all the four children, background activity had improved overall and epileptiform discharge had decreased significantly. In all the four cases, cranial MRI revealed varying degrees of brain atrophy. Treatment and recovery data are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Treatment strategies and prognosis of four patients with status epilepticus associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis.M. pneumoniae encephalitis is accompanied by epileptic seizures in 41% to 48% of cases, with status epilepticus accounting for approximately 50% of all epileptic seizures.[4,5] In this study, three children exhibited status epilepticus, whereas electrical status was observed in the remaining patient. It has been reported that the rate of abnormal EEG findings is relatively high in patients with M. pneumoniae encephalitis,[6] mainly manifesting as diffuse slow waves and epileptic discharge. In this study, all the four children with status epilepticus exhibited abnormal EEG findings (ie, diffuse slow waves). Three of these children exhibited epileptiform discharges in multiple brain regions, whereas one exhibited sustained spikes and slow waves in the bilateral frontal regions. EEG abnormalities were severe in all the four cases, indicating that brain damage may be more severe in the acute phase of M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus. However, due to a disease in progression and timely treatment, EEG findings improved to varying degrees in our patients. Although the slow-wave background activity remained, epileptiform discharge decreased significantly and status epilepticus did not recur. The prognosis of M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus is relatively good, and it is fairly easy to control status epilepticus. The common pathological changes associated with M. pneumoniae encephalitis include demyelination of white matter, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular edema, and glial cell proliferation. Imaging findings in patients with M. pneumoniae encephalitis can be normal, but may also reveal focal changes, diffuse edema, or abnormal intensity in the gray/white matter.[7] Some studies have indicated that high signal intensity in the striatum and midbrain can be observed on magnetic resonance images obtained from patients with M. pneumoniae encephalitis, and that images obtained from patients with myelitis show abnormal signals in the spinal cord.[8] In our study, three patients with M. pneumoniae encephalitis complicated by status epilepticus exhibited abnormal cranial MRI findings. One patient exhibited demyelinating changes in the paraventricular white matter, one patient exhibited abnormal signals in the bilateral hippocampus, and one patient exhibited abnormal signals in the left hippocampus. These findings indicated that the rate of MRI abnormalities was high in children with M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus, but that lesion location was nonspecific in such cases, which was similar to findings observed in patients with severe encephalitis.[9] Varying degrees of brain atrophy on cranial magnetic resonance images during convalescence might indicate that M. pneumoniae severely damaged the brain parenchyma, thereby damaging nerve cells and affecting their function. M. pneumoniae infection could lead to immune damage. Increases in M. pneumoniae antibody levels could be detected in the blood, and immunotherapy could improve the symptoms of M. pneumoniae infection.[10] In this study, IVIG was used in two cases, whereas dexamethasone was used in three cases, yielding good results in all cases. These findings suggested that although M. pneumoniae infection was the main mechanism in the early stage of the disease, immune responses might also play a role. Thus, early treatment strategies should utilize macrolides in conjunction with immunotherapy. The prognosis of M. pneumoniae encephalitis is poor and that the mortality rate is high. It has been indicated that surviving children experienced neurological sequelae and were highly unlikely to recover to baseline levels.[11] A previous study collected follow-up data for 2011 children with epileptic seizures after M. pneumoniae encephalitis for 6 to 131 months.[11] Among the 99 enrolled patients with M. pneumoniae-related encephalitis, 47 (47.5%) developed post-encephalitic epilepsy. Nineteen of these children (40.4%) with post-encephalitic epilepsy experienced intractable seizures. In this study, our four patients were treated with azithromycin and immunotherapy immediately after the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae encephalitis. Symptoms were controlled after 1 to 2 weeks of treatment, and no status epilepticus or refractory status epilepticus occurred. Furthermore, the rate of epileptic seizures decreased significantly after treatment with oral antiepileptic drugs and no children exhibited cognitive impairment. Although our findings suggested that early diagnosis and treatment of M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus resulted in relatively good prognosis, further studies that include more thorough neuropsychological testing at follow-up are required to verify this hypothesis. In conclusion, M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus occurs in relatively younger patients (ie, mainly in children with preschool age), who tend to exhibit abnormal MRI findings. Children with severe neurological diseases, such as status epilepticus, should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible to control symptoms and improve prognosis.

      "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators into the systemic circulation. Foods, medications, and insect stings cause most anaphylaxis for which a cause can be identified, but virtually any agent capable of directly or indirectly activating mast cells or basophils can cause it. This syndrome can consist of some or all the following signs and symptoms: diffuse pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; hypotension; and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Some of the other symptoms that can occur include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, headache, feeling of impending doom, and unconsciousness. Regardless of the presenting signs or symptoms, which usually present within 5–30 min following the administration of the offending agent, this reaction can progress to respiratory compromise and cardiovascular collapse resulting in human fatalities. Usually, the more rapid the onset of clinical manifestations, the more likely the anaphylaxis will be life threatening. Immediate and appropriate therapy, especially with epinephrine, is mandatory to reverse the reactions. While most reactions are uniphasic, some can be biphasic or protracted. This chapter discusses the immunopathologic mechanisms and effects of anaphylaxis.",

      "abstract": "Two situations, which may of course interfere, are described in the field of psychological and psychiatric emergencies in child and adolescent: 1) therapeutic emergencies, true emergencies, linked to acute mental suffering or even distress in the child which it is important to relieve quickly. They are not always the object of an acute request for medical care, and when such a request is made, it is rarely based on what the child feels, but much more on noisy or troublesome behaviour or somatic manifestations of the latter, this last possibility producing a masked psychiatric emergency very characteristic of this age; 2) environmental emergencies represent a second form of emergency, defined by a situation which appears when the child's family or tutors suddenly decide that they can no longer face such a behaviour or such symptoms in the child. Intolerance then appears, or even rejection of the child from his home. The authors were led to determine this double dimension, concentrating their attention on the first few years of life, childhood from 4 to 5 years to 11 or 12 years and adolescence. Insisting on the dual necessity, even in emergency cases, of sufficient reflexion and necessary concentration of interest on problems as they are presented by the family, the authors describe the various stages of an emergency: entering into contact, evaluation of the situation, choice of the emergency procedure: gaining time or admission to hospital in a specialized unit. They end by taking into consideration the fact that one is never sufficiently attentive to the child himself and to his own way of dealing with the situation.",

Duration of flexion is more than 0.5 s and not longer than 90 s, reoccurring in four or more sequences with an interval of 50–90 s between two events. It is associated with the spike of 8 microvolt above the baseline of EMG. In addition, it occurs during alpha waves of EEG. So, our motive is to repolarize the spike produced in EMG and bring it back to normal baseline.",

      "title": "Tackling anxiety and depression in older people in primary care.",
      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that anxiety and depression are less common in older than younger adults. One in ten people aged > or = 65 fulfils the diagnostic criteria for at least one common mental disorder. Older depressed patients have an increased risk of both cardiac and all-cause mortality. Both anxiety and depression in older patients are often unrecognised and untreated, and have a poor prognosis. There is a progressive decline in the prevalence of common mental disorders above the age of 55. Anxiety and depression often occur together, and share many risk factors. However, anxiety tends to follow threats or traumatic events, whereas depression follows loss events. Chronic diseases, cognitive impairment, pain and functional disability are risk factors for the onset of depression, but not anxiety. Depression is between two and three times more common among those with a chronic physical health problem. Even patients with major depression often remain unrecognised and untreated. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is by far the most common anxiety disorder in older people but most GAD patients are not recognised in primary care and only a third of them receive any form of treatment. Older patients often deny feeling anxious or depressed and are more likely to present with insomnia, irritability, agitation and multiple somatic complaints. GPs may erroneously believe that depression is a normal reaction to the losses of old age, and may be reluctant to initiate treatment. A good case can be made for replacing the PHQ-9 with the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale which almost entirely avoids somatic questions. This is a screening not a diagnostic tool and does not evaluate symptom severity.",

The language impairment can be fluent or nonfluent and may or may not interfere with word comprehension. Memory for recent events is preserved, although memory scores obtained in verbally mediated tests may be abnormal. Minor changes in personality and behavior may be present but are not the leading factors that bring the patient to medical attention or that limit daily living activities. This distinctive clinical pattern is most conspicuous in the initial stages of the disease and reflects a relatively selective atrophy of the language network, usually located in the left hemisphere.",

Es lo que tambien ha sido llamado paranoia, termino acunado por Hipocrates aunque el significado dado entonces era bien distinto al que la psiquiatria alemana redefinio dandole un sentido muy concreto y restringido para designar un trastorno que Kraepelin, conceptuo como un cuadro delirante cronico que cursa sin deterioro ni alucinaciones (excepto las asociadas al tema delirante). Este contraste entre la probada realidad deficiente de un area de la vida mental y la evidente normalidad en muchas otras del paciente, se refleja en el criterio C del DSM-5 y comentado por las personas que cuidan de estos pacientes, como a pesar de estar evidentemente confundidos, parece que en todo lo demas son basicamente normales (Kendler K. , 2012) Este fenomeno, al que ha acompanado una diversa sinonimia a lo largo de su historia, tal como paranoia vera, estado paranoide, delirio monosintomatico, enfermedad delirante, monomania, locura delirante cronica, parafrenia, entre otras, (Winokur, 1977). Hasta la llegada de los consensuados sistemas de Clasificacion de Enfermedades, tales como la Clasificacion Internacional de Enfermedades y la familia DSM, Clasificacion de Enfermedades Mentales en sus siglas inglesas. Ambas han permitido un sistema de nosografia que es revisable periodicamente a la luz de las nuevas evidencias cientificas, a la vez que abren nuevas lineas de investigacion por donde continuar avanzando.\r\n En la actualidad el fenomeno paranoia es una entidad clinica conocida como Trastorno Delirante (en adelante TD). Existen escasos estudios epidemiologicos sistematizados con criterios DSM en la literatura especializada del TD, quizas sea debido a su baja prevalencia a lo largo de la vida, que esta alrededor del 0,2% (APA, DSM.5, 2014).\r\n La controversia siempre ha acompanado al TD a lo largo de su historia, en ocasiones asimilado en el grupo de las esquizofrenias o de las demencias. La llegada del DSM-III (1987) con la denominacion de paranoia, incluyendolo en los trastornos paranoides no debidos a enfermedad organica, le otorgo nuevamente una entidad clinica perfilada (Dowbiggin, 2012), (Berrios G. , 2009).\r\n En este estudio conoceremos la evolucion historica del termino, los sintomas que lo constituyen y ahondaremos en los distintos subtipos clinicos que le caracterizan. Nuestra revision se complementa con los resultados de un estudio de 261 casos procedentes de un Registro de Casos, que sin duda contribuira al conocimiento de este poco estudiado Trastorno.",

The brief-lasting out-of-character homicidal episode with flat affect is typically associated with first-time formed or unformed hallucinations of various modalities and with overactivation of the autonomic nervous system.

They were followed for 1.6 years to 15 years (mean: 6.8 years) after the initial febrile convulsion. The incidence of subsequent epilepsy (two or more afebrile seizures) was 39%, and 80% of them developed epilepsy within 2 years after the first febrile convulsion. The paroxysmal discharges on EEG recorded prior to or after the first febrile convulsion did not predict the occurrence of later epilepsy. Also under 3 years of age, EEG findings led to the same result. There was no definite evidence that administration of anticonvulsive drugs prevented later epilepsy. Pre-existing neurological abnormality was identified as a risk factor for epilepsy, and was an indication of persistent medication. There is no clear prophylactic procedure against long-lasting attacks. Accordingly, medical therapy can be started when epilepsy has developed. Patients with very severe brain damage who could not move except lying comprised only 6% of all cases, and 69% of the epilepsy patients were well controlled. They showed a good prognosis as compared with children with brain-damage in general with epilepsy.",

Symptoms commenced in adolescence or early adult life in most patients, and remissions were uncommon. Narcolepsy occurred several times each day, often in unusual circumstances and sometimes with little warning. The mean total sleep time of narcoleptics was a little over 9 hours in each 24 hour period, as compared with under 8 in normal subjects. Cataplexy occurred in 93 patients, most commonly when subjects were tired. Attacks were similar in nature to physiological weakness with laughter, although other sudden sensory or emotional stimuli did not cause paralysis of voluntary movement nor loss of muscle tone in normal subjects. Half these patients had frequent dreams before the onset of proper sleep, and 62 had sleep paralysis. This was often frightening, with feelings of suffocation, accompanied by dreams, and of uncertain length. A minority of patients with narcolepsy had muscle aches and jerks before sleep, double vision or loss of focus during cataplexy, went sleep-walking by day, and had daytime hallucinations. Amphetamines had been given to 71 patients for periods of up to 33 years with adequate, but rarely complete, control of narcolepsy. Side effects were common and almost half these patients became tolerant, needing higher dosage to control symptoms. Three patients had a cerebrovascular accident whilst taking amphetamines. Imipramine or clomipramine had ben given in combination with amphetamines to 33 patients for periods of up to 6 years with considerable improvement in both cataplexy and sleep paralysis, and few side effects. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension as a result of amphetamines or combined treatment did not occur.",

The victim, as the recipient of the rapist's anger and need to control, experiences terror, fear of death, and helplessness. This results in classic posttraumatic symptoms of haunting, intrusive recollections, numbing or constriction of feelings and focus, and increased arousal. When this psychological trauma is not integrated, anxiety, depression, phobias, impaired sexual and social adjustment, negative self-image, and diminished capacity to enjoy life follow. Concepts of posttraumatic stress are reviewed and a definition of sexual assault is offered. The posttraumatic stress response to sexual assault is considered under the phases of response and symptoms, followed by the psychodynamics of this particular psychic trauma. A brief overview of treatment is outlined.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Myelomeningocele (MM), a type of spina bifida, is a protruding lesion along the midline of the spinal cord. It arises when the neuroectoderm is transformed into a neural tube and becomes detached from the cutaneous ectoderm. It is the most common malformation resulting from a disturbance in neurotation and occurs when a child is born with a protruding lesion that blocks closure of the neural tube (Fig. 11–1). The defect takes form between 26 and 30 days’ gestation; the later its development, the lower the lesion. Removal of the sac and closure of the neural defect usually are performed within 24 hours of birth to avoid infection. The sac contains meninges, dura, cerebral spinal fluid, and other neural elements. The effects depend on the level of the sac or lesion. The higher the sac, the greater the extent of paralysis. Manifestations range from weakness in the lower extremity to complete paralysis and loss of sensation, and thereby bladder incontinence. Upper extremity fine motor problems are also usually present, although to a lesser degree than lower extremity involvement. Approximately 90% of the children with MM have hydrocephalus, which is not fatal if treated promptly before brain tissue is destroyed. A ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt is used to relieve the pressure3 (Fig. 11–2). The median IQ of children with MM is 88. Even with normal intelligence, many children with MM have a learning disability. Trophic ulcers, spontaneous fractures, and deformities of lower extremities occur because of reduced ambulation. Obesity follows and usually is related to the level of the lesion; higher lesions produce the greatest amount of obesity. Myelomeningocele occurs in about 5 per 10,000 births in the United States and in 6.7 per 10,000 births in Ireland.6 It is found 2.5 times more frequently in whites than in blacks or Asians7 and more frequently in girls than boys in a ratio of 1.25:1.00. Recurrence in families where one child has spina bifida is 2.5 times greater than the incidence in the general population. However, the etiology of MM is unknown. It may involve both environmental and genetic factors. The first-born child is at greatest risk of developing MM.9 With surgical correction of hydrocephalus, removal of the lesion, prevention of renal damage, and provision of aggressive nutrition, orthopedic therapy, and other multidisciplinary therapy, survival may reach 80% to 95% rather than the earlier levels of 50% to 70%.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals, regardless of their age, are subjected to a significant psychosocial stressor, two possible outcomes are likely—in one instance the person is not significantly affected by the stressor and proceeds on with their life without indication of perceptible problem. In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Dissociation is a ubiquitous clinical phenomenon. Dissociative disorders (DD) are primarily characterized by dissociation, and dissociative states are also a criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative reactions such as depersonalization/derealization and amnesia (e.g., gaps in awareness/memory) across diagnostic categories are believed to be affect contingent and theorized to serve affect regulation functions. What is not clear, however, is how self-reported affect and physiological reactivity unfold within dissociative episodes. To address this issue, the present project aims to investigate the hypothesis (1) whether self-reported distress (as indicated by arousal, e.g., feeling tense/agitated, and/or valence, e.g., feeling discontent/unwell) and physiological reactivity increase before dissociative episodes and (2) whether self-reported distress and physiological reactivity decrease during and after dissociative episodes in a transdiagnostic sample of patients with DD, BPD, and/or PTSD. Methods and analyses: We will use a smartphone application to assess affect and dissociation 12 times per day over the course of one week in everyday life. During this time, heart and respiratory rates will be remotely monitored. Afterwards, participants will report affect and dissociative states eight times in the laboratory before, during, and after the Trier Social Stress Test. During the laboratory task, we will continuously record heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory rate, as well as measure blood pressure and take salivary samples to determine cortisol levels. Our hypotheses will be tested using multilevel structural equation models. Power analyses determined a sample size of 85.",

Here we report a case of acoustic sleep starts (“exploding head syndrome”) which contests this latter assertion because their onset coincided with the occurrence of a brainstem lesion.\n\n### Case report.\n\nA 64-year-old woman reported on problems initiating sleep related to the impression of a cracking sound of average loudness. Up to 15 times during the first hours after going to bed this sound occurred shortly after losing full consciousness, followed by an experience of jerking in all four limbs and a brief sensation of fear leading to full wakefulness.\n\nThe patient, who had been healthy until then, noticed her sleep problem for the first time 12 years ago, coinciding with the diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis. Corticosteroids were instituted under which no further progression of sarcoidosis occurred, even when steroids were tapered. Over this period the patient’s sleep problem was waxing and waning in intensity. Treatment with doxepin, citalopram, trimipramine, and amitriptyline led to no improvement. Only bromazepam (6 mg/day, 8 weeks) instantly led to unhampered sleep. Successive MRI scans of the brain (figure, A and B) revealed an unchanging, nonenhancing, singular, symmetric T2-hyperintense pontomesencephalic lesion around the periaquaductal gray reaching into the tegmentum.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure MRI …",

      "title": "Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Northern India",
      "abstract": "Irritable syndrome (IBS) is a recurrent disorder characterised by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort (often bloating), in association with altered generation and interpretation of function, which is not accompanied by anatomical anomalies or biochemical abnormalities. Symptoms tend to vary in manifestation and time course, worsen during flares, and affect patient's quality of life.1 A dysregulation of the brain-gut axis that interacts with visceral hypersensitivity and associated with observed digestive motor disturbances and micro-inflammation of the gut, with possibly an imbalance of the intestinal bio-flora. These are factors that may be responsible for the symptoms generation. Psychosocial stressors may then interact with biological factors and are modulated by cultural beliefs and practices resulting in variations on observed symptoms constellation and health seeking behaviours, a biopsychosocial disorder.\r\n\r\nA better outcome is achievable if a positive diagnosis of IBS is made, based on clinical symptoms (in the absence of alarm signs) alone, rather than making a diagnosis by exclusion. Several diagnostic exist and each new criterion refers to the insufficiencies of the previous ones. The most commonly accepted diagnostic include the original Manning and the subsequent series of foundation defined criteria. A formal definition according to the Rome III is recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month during the previous 3 months associated with two or more of the following with onset at least 6 months before diagnosis: (1) symptoms improvement with defecation, (2) onset associated with a change in the frequency of stools and (3) onset associated with a change in form or appearance of stools.1-4\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of IBS varies across the world, ranging from as high as 10%-20% in the West,5,6 to as low as 4.2% in India.7 There is a perception that IBS is less of a problem in Asia and its epidemiology to be different. In addition, the prevalence rates of IBS itself vary in Asia with higher rates being documented from more affluent urban communities of Japan, Singapore and Guangzhou in China.8-10 Prevalence rates also differ within the same country (Beijing 7.3% and Guangzhou 12%) and within the same racial community from different countries.8,11,12 Such observed differences may be due to the different (Manning vs Rome II vs Rome III) used to diagnose IBS or due to a different target population studied. However more recently, Park et al13 reported similar prevalence rates using Rome II (8%) and Rome III (9%) in a Korean IBS population.\r\n\r\nIn this study Makharia et al reported a prevalence rate of 4% which is in good agreement (4.2%) with a previous study by Ghoshal et al.7 This is interesting as the population involved in both studies were quite different. Ghoshal looked at subjects from mainly the hospital/clinic setting (recruitment centres from Northern, Central and Southern India) while the present study was solely community based (Northern India). Furthermore Makharia's group used a questionnaire based on the new Rome III module while Ghoshal's local criteria was more clinical and practical. Yet the resulting prevalence rates from both centers were quite similar. The observed prevalence rate is low compared to data from other Asian centers and also lower than the Western prevalence rates. We would expect lower prevalence rates from a rural community in Northern India, as IBS is recognized to be a disorder of developed nations and communities.8-10 However, Ghoshal's hospital based study confirmed that the prevalence rate is indeed low in India.\r\n\r\nOne possible explanation for the low prevalence rate could be from the use of different diagnostic tools or for the detection of a variable condition that is solely symptom based. One of the weaknesses of this study is that the used questionnaire was not validated for the study population. This might affect the quality of data acquired. However, a study from Nam et al14 using validated Rome III in Korea gave a prevalence rate of 8.2% which is still lower than the prevalence rates observed from communities in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nAnother unique observation is the much higher incidence of diarrhea predominant IBS (1.5%) compared to IBS constipation (0.3%). This was also reported from Ghoshal's study who also suggested that in general, Indians tend to pass 1-2 soft stool per day. This may be due to the higher fiber intake and faster gut transit time. Is it possible that another form of functional bowel or IBS exist in this sub-continent which is different from the West? Western patients tend to be more neurotic compared to the Asian patients who are more likely to be post infectious. This difference may also arise from other contributing factors such as race, different cultural practices, variation in food intake and co-existing lactose intolerance.\r\n\r\nThe other notable difference reported from this study is the increasing prevalence of IBS with advancing age, with the maximum in the 50-60 age groups. Across Asia, it has been noted that the prevalence of IBS is higher in the younger age group.8,9,11,12,15,16 In a rural community where the younger folks need to work hard for daily sustenance, symptoms of abdominal discomfort or alteration of pattern is often too trivial to be considered as abnormal enough to visit the hospital. The time of day in which the study was conducted in this native rural community of Northern India would also be important.\r\n\r\nThe often quoted male preponderance in Asian Indian IBS population was not demonstrated in this study. The prevalence of IBS was significantly higher in females compared with males. In the previous study by Ghoshal et al7 the subset of complainants in the study group showed a distinct predominance of male gender (68% vs 32%). The explanation given by the authors is that in a male dominant society, the health seeking behaviour of males can best account for the disparity in prevalence rates seen in the hospital/clinic setting compared to a rural community setting.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this study by Makharia et al is the first large scale IBS study in India using the Rome III criteria. However, this study has few limitations. Firstly, the diagnostic tool used, the Rome III questionnaire was not validated for this population. Secondly, it was also noted that the Glasgow pictorial stool chart was not used to determine stool forms. Even if patients can describe their stool forms adequately, pictorial definition is still the best method of evaluation since patient's perception is often very different from the actual stool form. Despite all of these, this study has contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology of IBS in India, by providing an alternative view point to the more accepted norms.",

      "title": "STRESS AND HEART",
      "abstract": "Background : Human beings throughout the world are faced with high and ever increasing levels of acute or chronic stress. Acute stress is defined as “the normal short-term physiological response to the perception of major threat or demands”. Chronic stress is defined as “the abnormal ongoing physiological response to the continuing perception of irresolvable major threats or demands”. 1 In fact, all these modern definitions of stress date back to the time of Hans Selye, the first scientist who studied the effects of stress on health and physiological integrity of living organisms. 2 Accordingly, the term stress pertains to effects of all environmental and psychosocial factors on physical or mental well-being. 1 The effect of stress on cardiovascular system has bean discussed for many years, 3 although until recently, the evidence has been relatively weak due to the complexity of such a relationship. 4 Among the many different types of stressors, mental and psychosocial stressors exert profound effects on the circulatory system. Primary studies on the relationship of stress with cardiovascular disease focused mainly on type A personality, then shifting to more specific components, i.e. hostility and anger, as stressful factors that provoke cardiovascular problems. 5 Behavioral or psychosocial stress induces or influences the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect. Psychosocial stress has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress which disturbs endothelial integrity and induces endothelial injury and dysfunction. 6 These processes activate beta 1-adrenoceptors that cause sympathoadrenal activation, which in turn enhances atherosclerosis. Also, behavioral or psychosocial stressors decrease estrogen, which may be of importance for the development of premenopausal atherosclerosis. 7 (1) HamidReza Roohafza MD. Psychiatrist,  Mental Health Research Unit, Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. Email: roohafza@crc.mui.ac.ir Stress is strongly associated with CAD. Clinically, mental stress is a cause of angina and may specifically worsen CAD. By provoking a dynamic decrease in coronary supply, mental stress may activate the ischemic response and induce substantial myocardial ischemia, and in the long term adversely affect prognosis in CAD patients. 8,9 Hostility and anger have also been shown to negatively influence ejection fraction and myocardial blood circulation, pointing out the importance of these phenomena as the etiology of CAD. 5 However, other forms of stress also have an impact. Behavioral/ psychosocial stress may participate in the development of CAD, via neuroendocrine mediation through sympathoadrenal activation (chronic sympathetic hyperarousal), seen clinically in angina/chest pain associated with normal coronary angiograms. 10 Stress clearly has the potential to actively trigger threatening cardiac events that lead to myocardial infarction. Mental stress increases the myocardial oxygen demand via sympathoadrenal activation and also involves a reduction in the myocardial oxygen supply, an eventually fatal consequence. 11 Mental stress obviously has a profound impact on long-term cardiac events and outcome. In particular, mental stress may cause paradoxical constrictions in patients with CAD/atherosclerosis, especially at points of stenosis - a response that correlates with the extent of atherosclerosis (plaque) and with the endothelium-dependent response to an infusion of acetylcholine (verification of endothelial dysfunction). 12 Discussion : Stress contributes to the onset, development, progression, and treatment delay of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of stress is high in both developing and developed countries, 13 an example of which is a large multicomponent interventional project on lifestyle habits performed in Iran, named Isfahan Healthy Heart Program, the results of which show high stress levels in 40% of men and 45% of women. 14 Thus, ‘lifestyle’ needs to be a central focus of prevention, 13 as this ‘epidemic of stress’ 1 may turn into a critical medical issue. Stress management interventions such as cognitive behavioral strategies to improve adaptive methods, and the use of relaxation response techniques are of growing importance in the future. 14",

It occurs in children of Jewish parentage, the majority of cases being reported from the U.S.A., with one from South America (Tyndel, 1955), and some from Montreal (Riley, 1955). The constant symptoms comprise: defective lachrymation (“crying without tears”); symmetrical, blotchy erythema following emotional disturbances or eating; excessive sweating; sialorrhoea; emotional lability; poor motor coordination; relative indifference to pain; and hypo- or areflexia. Inconstant symptoms are: intermittent hypertension; periodic vomiting which may threaten life; liability to respiratory diseases; frequent unexplained bouts of pyrexia; attacks of apnoea during the first year of life; corneal ulceration; orthopaedic changes (scoliosis, pes cavus); and epileptiform convulsions (Riley, 1952). The condition is familial, apparently being inherited as a simple recessive trait (Riley et al. , 1954), though an irregular dominant is a possibility (St. Martin, 1953).",

Drug-induced delirium is one of the major causes of delirium, and evaluation of this potential cause or contribution is an important component of the evaluation process, since it can lead to poor patient outcomes. This article will review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, diagnostic process, and causes of delirium in older people, with a focus on the pharmacological causes.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) occurs most commonly in infancy and childhood. Children with prior neurological abnormalities are most susceptible. More than 90% of cases are convulsive and the majority are generalized. SE may occur in the setting of an acute illness, in patients with established epilepsy or as a first unprovoked seizure. The etiology can be classified as idiopathic, remote symptomatic, febrile, acute symptomatic, or associated with a progressive encephalopathy. The morbidity and mortality of status have dramatically declined in recent years. Overall mortality in recent pediatric series was 3-10%, with almost all fatalities associated with acute central nervous system insults or progressive neurologic disorders. Neurological sequelae in children with idiopathic or febrile status are rare. Neurologically normal children with SE as their first unprovoked seizure have the same risk of experiencing subsequent seizures of any type as children who present with a brief first seizure. The risk of recurrent episodes of convulsive SE approaches 50% in neurologically abnormal children but is very low in neurologically normal children. The favorable outcome of SE in children may be related to advances in therapy and to the resistance of the immature brain to damage from seizures.",

The symptoms may vary from discomfort and pain to decreased body function and invalidity. Although it is not clear to what extent MSDs are caused by work, their impact on working life is huge. MSDs can interfere with activities at work and can lead to reduced productivity, sickness absence and chronic occupational disability [1].",

      "title": "Challenges in the diagnosis of Wilson disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract: The understanding and management of Wilson disease (WD) have dramatically improved since the first description of the disease by K. Wilson more than a century ago. However, the persistent long delay between the first symptoms and diagnosis emphasizes challenges in diagnosing earlier this copper overload disorder. As a treatable disease, WD should be detected early in the course of the disease by any health professionals at any care level, but the rare prevalence of the disease explains the lack of awareness of referring physicians. The most important challenge is to train physicians to recognize atypical or rare symptoms of WD that will lead to discuss the diagnosis more systematically. Atypia can come from the age of onset, the liver [non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) presentation], the central or peripheral nervous system (neuropathy, epilepsy, sleep disorders…) or may be due to lesions of other organs (renal manifestations, osteo-articular disorders or endocrine disturbances). Isolated biological anomalies, rare radiological findings or inadequate interpretation of copper test may also lead to misdiagnosis. The second challenge is to confirm the diagnosis faster and more effectively so as not to delay the initiation of treatment, and expand family screening as the genetic prevalence is higher than previously expected. Generalization of the exchangeable copper assay and the next generation sequencing (NGS) are two promising ways to overcome this ultimate challenge. By drawing attention to the earliest and rare symptoms and to new biomarkers and diagnostic tools, we hope that this article will increase diagnostic awareness and reduce delays so that patients can start their treatment earlier in the course of the illness and thus have a better disease prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Sometimes concussion is accompanied by an abrupt change in behavior, including psychosis or dementia, but concussion is not necessarily the cause. It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency that, despite recent improvements in the diagnosis and treatment, continues to be associated with a significant mortality, 3% in children and 22% in adults. It is a serious threat to life and is associated with a significant health care cost. A recent definition describes SE as more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity, or two or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. It has variable clinical presentation and may be general, partial convulsive or non-convulsive. SE complications the clinical management of approximately 10% of patients with epilepsy, and 75% of patients who develop SE do not have prior epilepsy. Patients with symptomatic seizures are more likely to experience SE. There is a consensus that a patient with SE needs to be treated as quickly as possible in order to prevent serious neurological damage. The treatment of SE can be divided in two steps: prehospital and hospital. Prehospital management of SE starts immediately on the spot were the patient is found, and very often-complete recovery depends on first aid. It is necessary in order to priority, to maintain vital functions, to treat the cause of seizures, to initiate rapid glucose determination and correction, to provide prophylaxis against further seizures, and to monitor the situation. Establish IV access ideally in large vein, because IV administration is the preferred route for anticonvulsants in SE. Benzodiazepines remain the mainstay of initial drug therapy for acute seizures. Diazepam administered IV or per rectum, has been and still is considered as one of the drugs of choice for the first line management of SE, especially in prehospital setting.",

Whereas pathognomonic motor signs are essential to diagnostic specificity, early symptoms important to recognition of a neurodegenerative disorder may be less apparent or diagnostically ambiguous. This observational study sought to identify the very earliest symptoms in the natural history of MSA. Detailed clinical histories focusing on early symptoms were obtained from 30 subjects recently diagnosed with MSA. Historical data were correlated with neurological examinations and laboratory autonomic testing. Subjects' mean age was 63.9 years. Ten were classified as having MSA-P and 20 MSA-C. The evaluations occurred 2.9 ± 0.4 months after diagnosis. The first symptom of MSA was autonomic in 22 (73%) and motor in 3 (10%) subjects (p < 0.0001). The most frequent first symptom was erectile failure, which occurred in all men beginning 4.2 ± 2.6 years prior to diagnosis. After erectile failure, postural lightheadness or fatigue following exercise, urinary urgency or hesitancy, and violent dream enactment behavior consistent with REM behavioral sleep disorder were the most frequent initial symptoms. Neither the order of symptom progression, which was highly variable, nor autonomic severity scores differentiated between MSA-P and MSA-C. The first symptoms of MSA are frequently autonomic and may predate recognition of motor manifestations. Orthostatic hypotension and, in men, erectile failure are among the first symptoms that, when evaluated in the context of associated clinical findings, may facilitate accurate and earlier diagnosis.",

      "title": "1440 Fractured Sleep: Serious Injury Uncovers a Challenging Case of Abnormal Movements in Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Disorders of arousal (DoA) and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) are difficult to distinguish. Both involve abnormal movements in sleep that may lead to serious harm to the patient or others. We present a case of abnormal movements in sleep leading to serious injury and discuss diagnostic features of SHE. Report of case The patient is a 48-year-old male with severe OSA on CPAP. He presented after multiple falls from bed. One fall resulted in a right tibial-fibular fracture requiring surgical fixation. He described five to ten episodes of nightly rhythmic limb movements leading to falls out of bed. The episodes occurred in the first half of the night. After an event, he would experience full awakening with preserved memory of rhythmic body movements leading to fall. Events were not dream related and devoid of sleepwalking, sex-related behavior, or sleep eating. Comprehensive physical and neurologic exam was only notable for ecchymoses on the right forearm. In-lab polysomnography on CPAP showed successful control of OSA and simultaneously captured eight episodes of abrupt onset stereotyped motor activity arising out of N3 sleep. These 30-90 second episodes included rhythmic arm flapping, head bobbing and synchronized leg movements. EEG during episodes was obscured by muscle artifact. EEG following episodes showed wake rhythm. There were no epileptiform discharges, hypersynchronous activity or build up to the episodes. The patient was treated with one milligram of oral clonazepam nightly and the episodes improved. He has had no falls out of bed or injuries since starting medication. Conclusion Distinguishing SHE from DoA is challenging. EEG abnormalities are not found in the majority of cases of SHE and more than half of patients are reported to have a normal scalp EEG. This patient had stereotyped movements captured on video with no epileptiform discharges on EEG. Unrecognized and untreated SHE may lead to serious injury. Diagnostic and confidence level criteria have been described by Tinipur et al. to support this important diagnosis in the absence of EEG-confirmed epileptiform activity. Video recording of episodes is a critical contributor to accurate diagnostic assessment of patients with abnormal movements in sleep. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "title": "Hipoadrenocorticismo em cão",
      "abstract": ". Hypoadrenocorticism (HA), or Addison's disease, is an endocrine disorder uncommon in dogs, primarily occurring between 1 to 6 years of age. It can be classified according to its origin as primary, secondary, or tertiary, with its primary form being the most common. It is caused by idiopathic immune-mediated destruction of the adrenal cortex, which can result in a deficiency of mineralocorticoids and/or glucocorticoids. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific, so patients may exhibit intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as hypotension, tremors, lethargy, anorexia, and weight loss. Diagnosis is made through anamnesis, clinical signs, hematological tests, urinalysis, and abdominal ultrasound. A definitive diagnosis requires the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, in which dogs with HA will show results below the reference range. Treatment should be based on the patient's overall condition and hormonal supplementation, which should be tailored to each dog's specific needs. This study aims to report the case of a 1-year-old Whippet dog admitted to a 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital due to episodes of vomiting and anorexia that evolved into an Addisonian crisis. After the diagnosis of HA and the initiation of treatment with prednisolone and fludrocortisone acetate, the patient was followed-up with for 965 days, during which it experienced episodes of vomiting in stressful situations and had sodium levels at the lower limit in hematological tests.",

      "title": "A rare yet treatable case of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Paroxysmal dyskinesias are movement disorders that manifest with recurrent abnormal involuntary movements that are episodic. The movements can be chorea, athetosis, ballism, dystonia, or a combination of all.[1] Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is the most common type of movement disorder, and it can be primary or secondary to some illnesses and is precipitated by sudden voluntary actions.[2] The secondary causes implicated are trauma; stroke; neurosyphilis; encephalitis; multiple sclerosis; and metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and kernicterus.[3] Here, we describe a case of secondary PKD. A 32-year-old man with normal birth and developmental milestones presented with multiple episodes of dystonic posturing in the left upper and lower limbs precipitated by walking or activity for 10 years. The frequency of the episodes was 4–5 per day. There was no preceding aura, sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, tongue bite, or urinary incontinence in any of the episodes. In addition, the patient denied any premonitory urge before the attacks, and they were not suppressible. Each episode lasted 25–40 seconds and used to occur soon after patient started walking and would subside spontaneously. There was no history of gait imbalance, cognitive impairment, or cranial nerve involvement. His family history was negative for similar complaints. He was treated with multiple antiseizure medications in the past with no relief in symptoms. On examination, the mini-mental state examination score was 30/30. His general physical examination was normal. His speech, cranial nerves, power, reflexes, and sensory and cerebellar examination were normal, and he was noted to have positive Trousseau sign. He underwent video electroencephalography recording with the possibility of seizures versus movement disorder. No epileptiform discharges were detected in both ictal and interictal electroencephalography. Routine investigations, including hemogram and renal and liver function tests, were within normal limits. The corrected serum calcium level was 5.1 mg/dL (8.6–10.2 mg/dL) and phosphorus level was 5.3 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Serum ionized calcium measured during the dystonic attack was 0.8 mmol/L (1.16–1.3 mmol/L). Serum ceruloplasmin, peripheral blood film for acanthocytes, and thyroid function were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed prolonged QTc interval. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed calcifications in the bilateral caudate, putamen, thalami [Figure 1], and cerebellum. Subsequently, the intact parathyroid hormone level was 1.56 pg/mL (normal, 15–65 pg/mL) and vitamin D level was 40 ng/mL (11–42 ng/mL). He was managed with acetazolamide and high-dose calcium supplementation, following which the attacks remarkably diminished in duration and frequency at his 1-month follow up.Figure 1:: Non-contrast computed tomography head showing calcification of the bilateral basal ganglia structures and thalamiThis case is noteworthy as it remained a diagnostic dilemma for approximately 10 years. Simple investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head clinched the diagnosis. A multitude of clinical features are reported in hypoparathyroidism such as seizures, tetany, depression, psychosis, and extrapyramidal manifestations.[4,5] However, case reports of hypoparathyroidism presenting as PKD are scarce.[6-9] The involuntary movements are due to low serum calcium levels; hypocalcemia renders the neuronal membrane hyperexcitable and leads to paroxysmal dyskinesia, but why the symptoms are paroxysmal is enigmatic. The symptoms usually respond to high-dose calcium supplementation. In addition, the dystonic movements can occur in the setting of normal serum calcium levels when there are extensive calcium deposits in the basal ganglia. Perfusion abnormalities have been noted in the basal ganglia of patients with PKD. The cause of hypoparathyroidism in this patient is highly likely to be idiopathic; we did not perform any genetic testing due to financial constraints. In conclusion, we report an uncommon but easily treatable secondary cause of PKD. Investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head helped in the diagnosis, and the patient responded well to treatment.

      "title": "Testing blood and CSF in people with epilepsy: a practical guide",
      "abstract": "Abstract Laboratory investigations, whilst not essential to the diagnosis of seizures or of epilepsy, can be fundamental to determining the cause and guiding management. Over 50% of first seizures have an acute symptomatic cause, including a range of metabolic, toxic or infectious cause. The same triggers can precipitate status epilepticus, either de novo or as part of a deterioration in control in individuals with established epilepsy. Some, such as hypoglycaemia or severe hyponatraemia, can be fatal without prompt identification and treatment. Failure to identify seizures associated with recreational drug or alcohol misuse can lead to inappropriate AED treatment, as well as a missed opportunity for more appropriate intervention. In individuals with established epilepsy on treatment, some laboratory monitoring is desirable at least occasionally, in particular, in relation to bone health, as well as in situations where changes in AED clearance or metabolism are likely (extremes of age, pregnancy, comorbid disorders of renal or hepatic function). For any clinician managing people with epilepsy, awareness of the commoner derangements associated with individual AEDs is essential to guide practice. In this article, we review indications for tests on blood, urine and/or cerebrospinal fluid in patients presenting with new‐onset seizures and status epilepticus and in people with established epilepsy presenting acutely or as part of planned monitoring. Important, but rare, neurometabolic and genetic disorders associated with epilepsy are also mentioned.",

      "abstract": "Here we report on a case of a 40-year-old female patient who presented with hypomanic episode after hyperthyroidism and major depressive episode after hypothyroidism, which was initially misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder due to another medical condition, and was found to be a co-morbid bipolar disorder of hyperthyroidism after treatment and follow-up. The course of diagnosis and treatment in this case suggests a close temporal relationship does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship on a physiologic level. User's Guide for the SCID-5-CV Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders elaborate that the diagnosis of \"……due to another medical condition\" is relatively rare, and co-morbidity between psychiatric disorders and somatic diseases is much more common. Therefore, the relationship between somatic diseases and psychiatric disorders requires careful study of symptom correlation and more time for observational follow-up. When in doubt, the examiner's default assumption should be that the somatic disease is not the cause (i.e., the psychiatric disorder is primary).",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",
