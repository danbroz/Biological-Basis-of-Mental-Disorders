      "title": "Schizoid Personality Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoid personality disorder (SPD) is one of the most interesting and theoretically complex personality disorders. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), SPD is described as a “pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following: (1) neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part of a family; (2) almost always chooses solitary activities; (3) has little, if any, interest in having sexual experiences with another person; (4) takes pleasure in few, if any, activities; (5) lacks close friends or confidants other than first‐degree relatives; (6) appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others; and (7) shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity” (p. 697).",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder in Children",
      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

      "title": "A Review of Schizophrenia in Childhood",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be viewed as a defect in organization resulting from varying combinations of genetic, organic, intrafamilial and social influences. A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

This was a case report about a 30 year old male from a rural area who presented with the complaints of being self absorbent, slothful, reluctant with self-laughing, self-muttering and odd behavior, having little interest in emotional reaction with poor social interactions and no interest in earning or pleasurable activities. On mental state examination his mood was found to be euthymic with restricted affect; decreased rate and rhythm of speech with impairment of judgement, abstract and insight. Other medical causes of such conditions were excluded. In addition to pharmacological treatment, psychological interventions were exercised and considerable improvement was noticed.

Behaviourally, schizophrenia patients have profound difficulties in regulating approach and avoidance, causing social withdrawal or aggressive behaviour. Evolutionary hypotheses of schizophrenia abound, but none covers all phenotypic aspects of the syndrome(s). Genetic risk for schizophrenia is partly conferred by genes that have undergone positive selection, whereby the reproductive advantage compensating for the reduced fecundity is as yet unknown. Environmental risk factors for schizophrenia comprise poverty, migration, and urbanicity, which has given rise to the hypothesis that individuals with schizophrenia are particularly sensitive to the exposure of strangers. In a more general vein, many signs and symptoms associated with schizophrenia can be interpreted from an evolutionary point of view. They pertain to diverse aspects of social life, including cooperation and trust (paranoia), mating (delusional jealousy, erotomania), and social rank (catatonic stupor, mutism).",

      "abstract": "Hypochondriacal delusions are not bound to a specific mental disorder, but occur in the whole spectrum of psychoses. In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

      "title": "Psychotic symptoms in young people warrant urgent referral.",
      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "title": "Early detection and intervention of psychosis. A review",
      "abstract": "The vulnerability and hybrid models for the onset of psychosis are presented. Familial liability, perinatal and developmental factors, and decreased cognitive performance associate with psychosis in adolescence and young adulthood. Genetic predisposition connected with behavioural deviances and/or mental symptoms associate with psychotic development so strongly that monitoring and intervention are indicated. Especially, in families where one or both parents or other family members are severely mentally ill, early family-centred assessments and interventions is needed. Together with familial psychosis, deficits in adolescent and young adult social development indicate thorough assessment, intensive monitoring and often also preventive interventions. During the prodromal phase of psychosis, patients often display unspecific symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, personality disorders, abuse of alcohol or drugs. Social decline, possibly associated with neurocognitive deficits, frequently occurs in the prodromal phase or in the early course of schizophrenia. Among help-seeking patients, occurrence of the Basic Symptoms represent the early initial prodromal state, while the late initial prodome state includes attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, and a first degree relative with psychotic disorder, or a schizotypal personality disorder, together with decrease global functioning. These patients suffer also from other mental symptoms and functional decline, and are clearly in need of psychiatric assessment and treatment. Intervention trials have shown that patients suffering from prodromal syndromes can be successfully treated, and onset of psychosis prevented or delayed. However, more large-scale studies and clinical case descriptions of treatment of patients with sub-threshold psychotic symptoms are needed.",

      "title": "Schizotypy, schizotypic psychopathology and schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The term schizotypy refers to a latent personality organization that putatively harbors the liability for schizophrenia and can give rise to a variety of schizophrenia-related phenotypic outcomes1, 2. This personality organization, which is determined by any number of as-yet-unknown schizophrenia-related genetic influences acting against a background of polygenic assets and liabilities as well as impacts from the environment (e.g., stressors, epigenetic inputs), can manifest itself variously at the phenotypic level, ranging from clinically diagnosable schizophrenia through pathological personality manifestations (e.g., schizotypal, paranoid, avoidant and schizoid personality disorders) to subtle, sub-clinical psychotic-like phenomenology (e.g., perceptual aberrations, magical ideation, referential thinking, interpersonal aversiveness). Schizotypy may also manifest itself in an imperceptible manner, undetectable by the unaided naked eye, through deviance on endophenotypes that have established valid relations with schizophrenia. Moreover, schizotypy as a latent construct (personality organization) is centrally embedded in a diathesis-stressor theoretical model that has considerable utility as an organizing framework for the study of schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related psychopathology (e.g., delusional disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizotypal, paranoid and other related personality disorders) as well as putative schizophrenia endophenotypes, a view I have advocated for several decades3-6. Note, the term schizotypy is not restricted to describe only those clinical manifestations that are associated with schizotypal personality disorder2, 5, 6. Nor is the term reserved to indicate a methodological preference, e.g. for self-report psychometric assessments. Rather, schizotypy can be assessed using a variety of approaches such as interviews, psychometric inventories, familial risk and/or laboratory measures. Schizotypic persons may indeed display some of the phenomenology associated with schizotypal personality disorder, but they may also show other features6-8. There is a long history of describing clinical states bearing the imprint of schizotypy and an implicit connection to schizophrenia liability, including observations by Kraepelin, Bleuler, Rado, Meehl, Gottesman and myself. It has been argued that a clear demarcation in an underlying schizophrenia liability continuum (e.g., a pronounced threshold effect or discontinuity) is required to explain the emergence of schizotypic indicators in psychological functioning. An alternative position regarding schizotypy holds that it is a dimension of normal personality, not necessarily connected to schizophrenia liability, and representing something of a \"healthy\" personality factor. However, observers of schizophrenia and schizotypic psychopathology, in the main, do not view schizotypy as benign or reflective of healthy psychological adjustment. Non-psychotic schizotypic states (defined using clinical, laboratory and/or familial risk) have been associated with a wide range of findings, including sustained attention deficits, working memory deficits, smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction, schizophrenia-related psychometric deviance on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), executive functioning deficits, dysfunctional anti-saccade performance, subtle formal thought disorder, clinical schizotypal and paranoid personality features, schizophrenia-related social cognition deficits, exteroceptive and proprioceptive somatosensory deficits, psychomotor abnormalities, and candidate polymorphisms (e.g., ZNF804A, Val158Met-COMT, neuregulin-1). That schizotypic persons manifest such a panorama of deficits, similar in nature albeit less in degree to those seen in schizophrenia, argues for a connection or common underlying construct for conditions defined phenotypically (i.e., schizotypic subjects vs. schizophrenia-affected subjects). An area of continued speculation concerns the underlying structure of schizotypy and the precise nature of the variation expressed in that latent construct. Considerable statistical evidence, using a variety of latent structure methods, points to the existence of possible underlying discontinuities or severe threshold effects in schizotypy, and work in this area continues. Such evidence stimulates the caveat, to wit, that the use of continuous measures to assess phenotypic manifestations of schizotypy does not ipso facto mean that the underlying (or latent) schizotypy construct is fully quantitative or uniformly graded by degree. The course and clinical outcome for those designated as harboring schizotypy remains an area of active inquiry. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals possessing schizotypy may traverse the life course escaping psychotic illness as well as other diagnosable schizotypic manifestations. The expectation that some people validly at risk for schizophrenia may never manifest the illness is well established in the reality of discordant monozygotic twins, in which one twin is affected by schizophrenia and the co-twin is not psychotic (perhaps not even diagnosable as having a non-psychotic, but detectable, clinical schizotypic condition like schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder). Individuals that achieve elevated scores on psychometric measures of schizotypy have been shown to be at increased risk for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related psychoses later in life, as well as a variety of other related outcomes. Such individuals also display poorer psychosocial functioning, lower rates of marriage, increased use of psychiatric medications, and increased utilization of psychiatric services2. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals designated as \"prodromal\" for schizophrenia, but who do not convert to schizophrenia (which is 60-70% of such subjects), are in fact harboring schizotypy and will, even if not psychotic, show impairments across the life span, perhaps adopting an eccentric or odd manner of personality functioning. The schizotypy model has helped to adjust the boundaries of schizophrenia phenotype in the DSM-5 (e.g., schizotypal pathology is now included with schizophrenia). Furthermore, illuminating the nature of schizotypy may aid in unraveling the current puzzle of the very low conversion to schizophrenia rates seen in \"prodromal\" schizophrenia research9. Finally, I have argued that the schizotypy framework may be useful in understanding configurations (rather than simple additive summation) of genes relevant to schizophrenia variants2, an idea that is beginning to gain traction. There is no doubt that incorporation of schizotypy indicators into genomic studies of schizophrenia increase their statistical power. The advantages of a cleaner unit of analysis (the schizotype), free from the effects of medication, institutionalization and neurocognitive decline, are axiomatic. However, the understanding (and misunderstanding) of the schizotypy model as well as alternative approaches to the construct require vigilance, in order to ensure that the approach continues to yield the fruit that it can.

      "title": "Emotional deficiency and psychopathy",
      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "title": "Interphase between skin, psyche, and society: A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

Such behavior should be treated as a signal of long-term stress and strife. A \"Psychological biopsy\" is outlined for evaluation of the severity and type of perturbation. This focuses on 9 areas of inquiry: the circumstantial lethality of the event; prior self-destructive behavior; depression; hostility; stress; reaction of the parent or parent surrogate; loss of communication; lack of resources; and extremes of parental expectations and control. Adolescents under severe familial and socioeconomic stress, and with a history of acting-out behavior, often respond well to transfer to a more favorable home situation. In cases where there is no apparent familial perturbation, the physician should be alert to the possibility of severe psychiatric disorder. In either case, initial definition of the problem opens the way to a plan for management and support.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe type of mental illness that is both persistent and burdensome. Because they are under a lot of stress coping with caring for schizophrenia patients, family members of these patients often have a negative attitude and a wide spectrum of expressed emotion towards them. The quality of interaction patterns and the type of family ties among family caregivers and individuals with schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions are classified as an unfavorable family environment. [1] Large volumes of emotion directed directly at a person or within a family environment are referred to as “high expressed emotion.”One or more parents’ critical or emotionally over-involved attitudes and behaviors toward their schizophrenia offspring are referred to as expressed emotion. [2]. Any aberrant processes inside a family, such as conflict, communication problems, cold parenting, criticism, control, and excessive amounts of expressed emotions, are referred to as family dysfunction.. These could be risk factors for schizophrenia onset and maintenance. Schizophrenics who returned home to such a family were more prone to relapse than those who returned home to a family that expressed little or no emotion. While not on medication, returning to a high expressed emotion family resulted in a large rate of recurrence.

      "abstract": "Introduction Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental disorder characterized by unstable relationships, a tendency to self–destruction, affective and behavioral dysregulation and BPD are a clinical problem Objectives Early detection and timely intervention for BPD is becoming a new public health priority as it helps prevent the adverse personal, social and economic consequences of the disorder. Borderline personality disorder first manifests itself, as a rule, in adolescence, so it is easy to mistake it for manifestations of “difficult age” characteristic of the period of growing up. In this sense, the typical signs of borderline personality disorder are not original: low self-esteem, emotional excitability, impulsive behavior and sudden mood swings, to one degree or another characteristic of all adolescents. An alarming exception is, perhaps, only a tendency to self-harm and, the so-called, desocialization of a teenager, the loss of social skills and connections (for example, friendships). Recently, experts have increasingly mentioned desocialization in connection with the development of Internet technologies and gadgets that replace communication in real life for many teenagers Methods An anonymous survey of 57 older teenagers conducted. The degree of borderline personality disorder assessed using IPDE, STAI, and CDI. Statistical processing of the results carried out in Microsoft Excel using measures of the central trend (arithmetic mean, standard deviation) and correlation analysis. The significance of the differences between the groups was determined using the Student’s t-test (p &lt; 0.05) Results On average, the level of BPD among the respondents was at a low level of 9.81 (±4.43) points. The severity of personal anxiety was at a high level of 45.02 (±13.25) points, situational anxiety was also at a high level of 41.14 (±14.93). The severity of depression was above average and amounted to 55.84 (±14.33) points Conclusions Teenage girls are more prone to anxiety and depression than boys are. High anxiety causes a tendency to depression, and these two factors affect the occurrence of PRL.

      "abstract": "20 couples, each of which with one spouse suffering from schizophrenia, are investigated with clinical and psychological (individual and consensus Rorschach, Freiburg personality inventory) methods. Married schizophrenics seem to be less schizoid than passive dependent, infantile or stormy in their premorbid personality. Regarding our results their spouses don't differ in their mental health from the average population. Behaviour disorders of the non-schizophrenic spouses rather have to be seen as reactions caused secondarily by the patient's schizophrenic symptoms than as characteristics of their primary personality, because they only arise in the exploration of both spouses together. The schizophrenics appear less disturbed in the interaction with their spouses than in the situation of the single exploration. The \"interacting personality\" of the non-schizophrenic spouses, however, seems to be more disturbed than their \"individual personality\". Special factors, which are connected with premorbid personality of the later schizophrenic, are important in the mate selection. Very often first manifestation and the course of schizophrenic syndrome on the one hand and the marital dynamics on the other hand are closely related. Describing the attitude of the spouses to each other the non-schizophrenic shows three characteristic patterns, which are seen in the interaction of the couple: acceptation, emotional distance and ambivalence. Further the question of indication and prospect of marital therapy is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "For most patients with schizophrenia it is difficult to sufficiently participate in the community, largely due to deficits in social interaction. The decreased ability to interact with other people and understand them is affected by the way patients perceive themselves. As schizophrenia is seen as a disorder of fundamental self-disturbances, in this thesis a series of empirical studies explore how schizophrenia is related to components that are crucial for making a distinction between oneself and others, hereby focusing on the concepts of body ownership, self-agency, and empathy. The feeling of body-ownership and the feeling of self-agency are considered the most important aspects for basic self-experience and contribute to a feeling of presence and being. Therefore, using a Rubber Hand Illusion paradigm, we provide insight into disturbances in the feeling of body ownership in patients with schizophrenia and in adolescents at increased familial risk to develop the disease. Second, self-agency inferences can result from implicitly associated cues or situations that can unconsciously pre-activate or prime an outcome representation in the agent’s mind. As previous studies found that patients with schizophrenia show specific impairments in these prime-based self-agency inferences, which are particularly important in social behavior, the current thesis provides insight in this topic. Third, as empathic abilities are an important predictor for functional outcome in schizophrenia, our research aims to increase knowledge about its etiology by focusing on the role of the self-reflection network in the brain. Summarizing, this thesis contributes to our understanding of self-disturbances in patients with schizophrenia by using experimental set-ups.",

      "abstract": "Every illness represents in some way a threat and increases the sense of vulnerability. The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, typically auditive ones, delusions, disorganized thinking and behavior, and flat or inappropiate affect. Symptoms develop gradually and usually begin during young adulthood and are never resolved completely. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a holistic psychiatric history that includes the person’s reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the patient. Objectives - Explore what schizophrenia is, its main characteristics and how it differs from other mental disorders. - Analyze how schizophrenia affects families and interpersonal relationships. Methods Middle-aged man who resides with his adoptive parents in a town near the municipal seat, unemployed and longitudinally with few social relationships and a lover of technology. He has attended psychiatric consultations on specific occasions and irregularly without a clear diagnosis. a single admission to a city psychiatric hospital for psychotic symptoms that subsided with medication. Since then, monitoring has been erratic and he has been given medication disguised by his parents during meals. In the last two weeks he has been especially distrustful and suspicious, even with his parents, so he has barely been able to sleep and does not eat properly for fear of being poisoned. He has confined himself to his room and refuses to be evaluated by a doctor and his anguish and emotional lability are increasing. For this reason, he is taken to the emergency room, where he is evaluated and it is determined that he is going through an episode with psychotic characteristics, which is why it is necessary, given the repercussion of the condition and the patient’s lack of cooperation, to be involuntarily hospitalized for treatment and stabilization. Results During admission, he experiences episodes of intense agitation and serious behavioral alterations that require important pharmacological adjustments. In addition, work is done on awareness of the disease and acceptance of the diagnosis. Although he is initially reluctant to take any type of intervention, he progressively accepts taking medication and understands the nature of his problem, as well as the need to continue monitoring his disorder at an outpatient level. We were also able to provide psychoeducation to the family, thus achieving commitment and support on their part as well, since at first they were reluctant that their son could suffer from schizophrenia, for fear of the stigma and rejection that this could cause. Conclusions People with schizophrenia often face social stigmatization, which can lead to further marginalization, isolation and discrimination. This affects their emotional and mental well-being, contributing to a decrease in quality of life. Lack of adequate understanding of the disorder reinforces these myths and perpetuates discrimination. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Several scales are described for measuring aspects of eccentricity and social isolation; in particular, for assessing schizoid and schizotypal personality and for rating abnormal non-verbal expression. The latter is shown to be reliable, and the former to have a measure of validity. There was an association between schizoid personality traits and abnormalities of speech and non-verbal expression. However, abnormal non-verbal expression, but not schizoid personality traits or DSM-III schizotypal personality disorder, was particularly likely to occur in those subjects who had evidence of neurological deficit, and childhood symptoms indicative of developmental disorder. Abnormal non-verbal expression, but not personality disorder, was also associated with other characteristic features of Asperger's syndrome, such as unusual, 'special' interests. It is suggested that Asperger's syndrome is a distinct syndrome from either schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder, but may be a risk factor for the development of schizoid personality disorder.",

Given unfavorable polygenic potentiators (eg, introversion, hypohedonia, and anxiety) and adverse life experiences (eg, childhood trauma or adult misfortune), around 10% develop schizophrenia. That schizophrenia is basically a neurologic disorder does not contradict whatever is known about its psychodynamics, nor preclude efficacy for psychotherapy or other psychosocial interventions. Research should concentrate on soft neurology and psychophysiology as indicators, being closer in the causal chain to the schizogene than psychometric, social, or high-level cognitive processes. Taxometric statistics are appropriate to testing a major locus model not simplistically formulated.",

The characteristic feature of DSED is disinhibited, socially indiscriminate social behavior that begins prior to the age of five years. Children with DSED exhibit reduced reticence in approaching unfamiliar adults, overly familiar behavior, lack of checking back with their caregiver after venturing away, and willingness to leave with an unfamiliar adult. The assessment includes a psychiatric evaluation and observation of how the child interacts with their caregiver and unfamiliar adults. There are no medication treatments for DSED; however, psychiatric comorbidities may benefit from psychopharmacology. The cornerstone of treatment for DSED is providing the child with an emotionally available attachment figure. It may be necessary to limit the child’s exposure to strangers for several months to reduce socially indiscriminate behaviors.",

The correlates of emotional incapacities, emotional hypersensitivity, and normal emotional activities in psychopaths are studied and discussed in this paper. Emotional hypersensitivity might be linked with: a history of neglect, rejection and abuse; insult; changes which are forced or not under control of the psychopath; obstacles that prevent the psychopath to do what he or she wants to do; narcissistic injury; broken friendships or relationship. Normal emotional functioning might be associate with grief, warm relationship, adequate attention, disease, academic and/or occupational success, impressive events, confrontations, contemplation and maturation, hidden suffering (also as a result of neurobiological determination).",

Their own experiences are processed by them in more emotional than rational manner, and their feelings are expressed spontaneously and creatively. They are willing to experiment with various systems of values and roles; they are charming and cheerful in the company of others. Apart from that, they are clearly on the look-out for the closeness in interpersonal contacts. In clinical terms, a typical set of symptoms observed in case of people with borderline personality includes: changeable or low level of internalization of relations with the object, peculiar defense mechanisms of ego, pathological narcissism and the lack of impulse zone control. It is reflected in the attitudes of people with formed borderline personality, who are alternately excessively demanding and strict, while at different times too tolerant and lenient.",

      "abstract": "The author fundamentally questions the traditional concept of the disease-entity (or several disease entities) of 'schizophrenia' and discusses an alternative concept, based on vulnerability and information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first, premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid 'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees, which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly delimitable disease entity of schizophrenia with constant causes, psychopathological picture, or course, but rather a multi-conditioned life-process, occurring in people with a particular vulnerability, interacting with complex life-events and circumstances. This new concept has important consequences for therapy and prevention.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenic psychosis is rare in patients below 15 years of age. Early diagnosis is crucial as the illness is likely to have a poor outcome: indeed, duration of untreated psychosis may exert a negative influence on the prognosis. Thus, it may be highly relevant to recognise premorbid changes of character traits, behaviour and cognitive problems which are reflected in worsening school performance. For example, some 40 to 50% of the children who later develop a psychosis will show social withdrawal, loss of interest in age-appropriate activities, peculiar or immature responsiveness, increasingly suspicious, fearful or depressive states, baseless despair, unusual somatic complaints, concentration problems, cognitive and linguistic disabilities, and peculiar motor movement disorders such as bizarre, ritualistic behaviour, mannerisms, stereotypies, echopraxia. These features are non-specific: they can but need not represent the early signs indicating later development of schizophrenia. They should be evaluated in terms of potential psychosocial, genetic and somatic pre-, peri- and postnatal risk categories. During the child's development these features may build up to constitute vulnerability and stress factors that may lead to psychotic breakdown. Early age of onset correlates with high social disability scores. Complete remission is an extremely rare event in patients with gradual-insidious onset of psychosis.",

Childhood psychopathology is generally divided into two classes, externalizing and internalizing disorders. A child with an externalizing disorder, such as conduct disorder, is aggressive and destructive apparently without adequate provocation. He (boys show much higher rates of conduct disorder than girls) will react to other children’s playful or friendly overtures with hostility. He steals from his parents without regard to their feelings. He taunts and teases until his sibling starts to cry. Such behaviors have an emotional quality. He seems to be angry with the world and he maintains a mode of retaliation. A child with an internalizing disorder behaves differently. She (girls have a somewhat higher prevalence of internalizing disorders than boys) may withdraw from many situations because they make her feel frightened. She often feels lonely, and feels that others do not like her. Her mood is often low and she is unlikely to initiate activities with peers.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

Both latter conditions are usually not mentioned in the literature among consequences of physical abuse. Furthermore, the maltreatment can modify manifestations of affective disorders. Prolonged maltreatment can induce psychiatric abnormalities also in initially healthy individuals, in particular, paranoid ideations. Children and adolescents regularly punished for hyperactivity or other behaviors, regarded by perpetrators to be undesirable, would discontinue these behaviors but start adaptive or maladaptive conduct that may be more or less compatible with autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Repetitive binge drinking can be compulsive. Besides, loitering with drinking companies is a way of escape from domestic violence. It is known that autistic persons tend to avoid socialization. However, in conditions of collectivism and a pressure to be “normal” like everyone, individuals with communication abnormalities would have strong motives to contact with peers to avoid stigmatization. Alcohol consumption and, in particular, binge drinking is a method to overcome communication barriers. In doing so, the individuals often forget that excessive alcohol consumption may cause health problems.",

People with this disorder may, for example, refrain from trying new activities for fear of failure. They are also likely to be inhibited in relationships, even with family members, for fear of shame and ridicule. This leads to isolation and a lack of close relationships, and often to secondary disorders such as major depressive disorder. This negative cycle is not a function of disinterest in intimate relationships. Rather, the fear of negative evaluation is so intense as to outweigh the deep‐seated longing to interact with others.",

Case presentation: A 22 years old individual, single, without children, technician, without history of mental disorders who is studied by Forensic Psychiatry because he attacked his maternal grandfather with a knife, which caused his death.  Psychiatric examination was done; the Impulsiveness Scale was applied; and an enlectroencephalogram (EEG) and a psychological evaluation were carried out, which included Bender, Machover, and Rorschach tests. The evaluating staff made the diagnosis of Schizotypical disorder, without mental derangement. Conclusions : Schizotypical disorder is not a frequent diagnosis in Psychiatry.  When it is involved in criminal behaviors, they occur in isolation and they are usually related to attacks to other persons.  It is a determinant condition of semi-imputability or imputability.  Prison system is not recommended.

      "abstract": "Antisocial personality disorder (APD) is characterized by a behavioral pattern of contempt and disregard for the safety and rights of other people, with no feelings of regret, guilt, remorse or compassion.Usually such characteristics emerge in early adolescence as a behavioral trend with oppositional attitudes to their elders or the existing rules.These individuals are often self-centered and incapable of experiencing grief or feeling of guilt.Given the lack of moral values that permeate their conduct, they present recurrently immoral, socially reprehensible behaviors or violating laws or current regulations 1 .APD and psychopathy should not be used as synonymous, since they do not refer to the same construct.There are many individuals with APD who do not exhibit criminal behavior.The expression psychopathy is often used to classify individuals who present an important tendency towards criminal practice, characterized by a high rate of recidivism, emotional detachment, and violent and antisocial conduct.When individuals with APD develop criminal conduct, often they become counterfeiters, scammers, corrupts and corrupters, etc. (damage against property).Conversely, psychopathic individuals tend to manifest criminal behavior based on the expression of predatory violence typical of homicidal, serial killers, rapists and kidnappers (damage against the person) 2 .In \"Civilization and its Discontents\" 3 , Freud presents the human being as a creature driven by powerful instincts of aggression and primitive passions, which lead to actions such as rape and murder, controlled, still imperfectly, by the social institutions and the feelings of guilt.Unconsciously, people exercise their drive for aggression through their fantasy, in a not acting manner.The psychopath exerts this deadly and aggressive guilt-free drive by acting and, is looked by the others with much interest and curiosity, projecting on them his unconscious living.It's like being at the same time terrified and fascinated by this dark side of the human being.From a contemporary perspective, Simon 4 claims that traits of sadism found in serial killers have their most representative correspondents in individuals who will never commit murder or sadistic sexual crime of any kind.They are respectable people, good mothers, good parents and successful professionals, getting to sublimate their selfishness and aggression, transforming them into empathy to the others.It is possible that there is a correlation between the social violence portrayed in sensationalist media and the recurrence of violent acts that occur in current society.Sensationalism stimulates",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria. But we know that hysteria encompasses more than various types of neurosis, and can also manifest itself in psychotic and psychopathic-like patterns of behaviour.",

Physical anhedonia represents the inability to feel physical pleasures (such as eating, touching and sex), while social anhedonia describes the incapacity to experience interpersonal pleasure (such as being and talking to others). In schizophrenia, anhedonia had differently been considered as a personological trait giving rise to the development of psychosis or as a basic symptom underlying the pathological process. Aim of this study was to examine the psychopathological characteristics of anhedonia in schizophrenic patients and to investigate the clinical relations with negative, positive, disorganized and depressive symptoms.",

These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms.

In the period preceding the onset of frank psychosis (onset), patients vary relative to the rapidity of onset, the presence or absence of asociality, and the presence or absence of semipsychotic symptoms. Following the onset of psychosis (middle course), patients may suffer from episodic or unremitting psychosis, and may or may not exhibit the deficit syndrome. In late adult life (late course), patients vary relative to the presence or absence of an improvement in psychosis and social capability. The usual approach to the study of putative course subtypes is to define a subtype by a number of features; they may include features of more than one epoch. In addition, the course of psychosis has not been distinguished from enduring personality impairments in these subtypes. Another approach to defining putative course subtypes would be based on dichotomizing patients according to the presence or absence of a particular feature of a single epoch. This second approach has important advantages: the availability of larger study populations and a diminished liability for confounding due to the correlates of features other than those under scrutiny.",

      "title": "The promise of social recovery therapy in non‐affective psychoses",
      "abstract": "Non-affective psychoses (schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorders) are the health conditions of working age adults most frequently associated with poor social outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies suggest that less than 50% of people with these conditions achieve social recovery, less than 15% achieve sustained recovery in both symptomatic and social domains, and only 10-20% of people return to competitive employment, despite the majority reporting that they wish to work1. Social recovery therapy (SRT) is a psychosocial treatment to promote social recovery in people with non-affective psychosis who are socially withdrawn, have complex and comorbid problems, and are unresponsive to existing interventions. It is based on a model in which social disability evolves as a result of lifestyle patterns of low activity, adopted to achieve behavioral avoidance, and maintained by lack of hope, agency and motivation. Social disability in psychosis typically occurs in the context of persistent positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, often accompanied by depression, anxiety and other psychopathological manifestations. Alongside such issues are complex social circumstances and systemic issues, including problematic family dynamics, victimization, social threat and social deprivation. In the face of such problems, individuals adopt lifestyle patterns of extreme social withdrawal, leaving work or education and losing contact with social networks. SRT is described in a manual2 and delivered individually across 9 months. Sessions take place in participants' homes and community locations. Interim telephone and email contact usually occurs. SRT delivery is structured in three stages. Stage 1 includes assessment and development of a shared social recovery formulation. Stage 2 involves identifying and working towards medium- to long-term goals guided by a systemic formulation of barriers to recovery, with a focus on promoting a sense of agency, hope and motivation, and encouraging activity while managing psychotic symptoms. Stage 3 involves the active promotion of structured activity linked to meaningful goals, while still managing symptoms. The focus of the intervention is on the individual's personal values and goals, identifying problems and barriers to these, then promoting hope for meaningful behavioral change and activity toward these goals. There is a strong emphasis on the use of behavioral strategies (including behavioral experiments, graded exposure and behavioral activation) to overcome avoidance and promote meaningful lifestyle change in vivo whilst managing symptoms as necessary to implement a concrete pathway to social recovery. Evidence and experiences from this behavioral work are used to further instill hope and promote positive beliefs about self as the individual works towards achieving meaningful change in his/her life. As SRT aims to engage people with psychosis into structured activity, it often includes supporting them to access employment, education, training, voluntary and/or leisure opportunities. Much of SRT takes place in community settings. It is often useful for the therapist to drive the client to new locations and settings or accompany him/her on public transport. To achieve gains in social recovery against a background of often years of withdrawal and social disadvantage means that therapists have to integrate techniques typically associated with assertive community treatment and supported employment. Working systemically with families and stakeholders surrounding the individual to promote opportunities in the social environment is also important. Behavioral activation and behavioral experiments are conducted in line with the client's identified goals and values and at a pace respecting the nature of the difficulties faced. The therapist works alongside the client to aid motivation and engagement in identified activities that can be incorporated into daily life, and work out collaborative strategies to manage ongoing symptoms in vivo. To date, we have conducted two assessor-blind randomized controlled trials of SRT in people with psychosis with severe social disability. In the Improving Social Recovery in Early Psychosis (ISREP) trial3, 77 participants with affective or non-affective psychosis presenting social withdrawal were randomized to receive either SRT plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone. TAU consisted of case management from a secondary mental health care team. In the non-affective psychosis group, SRT showed a significant and clinically beneficial effect on the primary outcome of weekly hours in structured activity, as well as on positive and negative symptoms. There was also an effect of SRT on hopelessness and positive beliefs about self, with improvements on these variables being a mediator of the change in structured activity. The intervention was also cost-effective4. SUPEREDEN35 was a larger (N=154) phase 2 trial aimed to enhance social recovery in patients who had not responded to early intervention service (EIS) treatment, by combining standard EIS provision with SRT. The primary analysis indicated that the SRT plus EIS was associated with an average increase in structured activity over 8 hours per week greater than EIS alone (95% CI: 2.5-13.6; p=0.005). The size of the effect represents an amount of activity equivalent to a full working day. There is evidence from both the above trials that the gain from SRT may be maintained 6 months beyond active treatment. In a further separate longer-term follow-up study on the ISREP group6, none of the 24 cases in the TAU group had engaged in paid employment in the year following the end of the intervention period, compared with 5 out of 20 (25%) cases in the SRT+TAU group. SRT offers most promise in promoting social recovery in complex cases of non-affective psychoses in which there is little evidence of response to other interventions. Although the results from the two available randomized controlled trials are positive, further large scale pragmatic studies are needed, possibly being expanded to more chronic cases. There may also be promise in combining SRT approaches with other psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive remediation therapy7. We designed SRT so that it can be delivered in task-sharing formats by a less costly and more widely available workforce than that involved in the above trials. We have now developed extensive training materials, including videos as well as adherence and supervision guidance, which we have collated on a website8. Through this and related work, we have found that it is possible to train \"non-expert therapists\" in key elements of the SRT approach, which can then be successfully implemented following the manual. What is needed in the future is to build on the promise of the existing trials of SRT toward further research and implementation involving non-expert therapists and extending into wider populations of people with non-affective psychosis in the community.",

      "abstract": "Impairment of social cognition is one of the main features of schizophrenia. This feature is extensively studied in the present day, there are several studies investigating various domains of social cognition and their neurophysiological substrates, as well as its relationship with functional outcome, neurocognition and symptoms. In spite of this, the options for treatment are limited. A number of tests that measure social cognition are available, however there is a lack of standardized battery, that would measure these abilities across domains in time. This is to some extent due to wide array of manifestations, from recognition and discrimi- nations of emotions of others, emotion processing to understanding of intentions and beliefs of others. The borders between areas are not clearly set, the deficit in the domains is consistent thorough the whole course of disorder. The deficit is most prominent during first episode, but can be traced in an attenuated form also in the prodromal phase, and continue to be present during remission. The sings of impaired social cognition were found also in first-degree relatives and individuals with ultra-high risk for psychosis. The social cognitive abilities are not explainable by deficits in neurocognition nor metacognition. In addition, they are related to presence of disorganized and negative symptoms. They are also significantly associated with quality of life and functional outcome, more than neurocognition. Training of social skills and social cognition shows effect of improvement, from moderate in general functional outcome, to high improvement in tests measuring performance in specific social-cognitive domains. Psychopharmacological research to this date has been focused mainly on effects of antipsychotic medication, improvement is however clinically insignificant. The findings summarized in this paper might contribute to better understanding of impairment of social cognition in schizophrenia, and focus the research on the areas that will result in development of more effective treatment methods.",

      "abstract": "Treating patients with schizophrenia mostly in the community causes more problems for the families. Shame, guilt, fear, helplessness, hopelessness, and anger are feelings frequently experienced by families. The main difficulties are financial problems, intra-familial conflicts, negative effects on social life, and the rejecting attitude of the community towards the patients. Negative symptoms are especially burdensome for the families. Families with inadequate social support, with high expressed emotion, and who cannot use effective coping styles have heavier burdens. When the relationship between schizophrenia and family is investigated in a historical context, it is seen that most investigators supporting psychological theory consider the family to be the cause of the disease. These theories, which depend mostly on clinical observations and which have damaged the relationship between the clinicians and the family members, have lost their validity during the last thirty years. Family should be included in the treatment plan. Hospitalization due to the first psychotic episode or further psychotic recurrences is the most convenient period for establishing contact with the families. One should approach the family in a supportive and empathic manner, without putting any blame on them. If maladaptive coping styles are being used, one should help the family to change to adaptive ones. In addition to educative and supportive groups, more specific methods like cognitive-behavioral therapies can be used. Families should be supported in terms of forming non-governmental organizations.",

The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

Early in the twentieth century, schizophrenia was known as dementia praecox (premature dementia), because of the disintegration or fragmenting of mental functions typically observed in people with the disorder. The term schizophrenia itself means “fragmented mind,” referring to the schisms between thought, emotion, and behavior that characterize the disease. It is not the same as “split personality,” which is an altogether different illness now known as dissociative identity disorder.

      "abstract": "The relationship between suicidality and substance abuse has long been recognized, although studies have only fairly recently begun to identify factors that may help clarify how alcohol or other drug abuse increases the susceptibility to suicidal behavior in vulnerable populations. In particular, alcohol and other psychoactive substance misuse has been linked with mood destabilization and the induction of manic or depressive episodes in affectively ill individuals, while also demarcating groups with heightened tendencies toward impulsivity, aggression, and sensitivity to interpersonal loss. Serotonergic mechanisms have been implicated in each of these clinical settings, along with possible dysregulation of other neurotransmitter systems. Psychosocial aspects of alcohol or drug abuse relevant to suicide may involve a heightened sensitivity to interpersonal loss, poor coping skills in response to adverse life events, and affective dysregulation induced by circadian and psychosocial stresses. Consequently, self-destructive behaviors with relatively little premeditation may arise during periods of increased stress, intoxication, depression, or other psychopathology. Early detection of substance abuse followed by appropriate pharmacologic and/or psychotherapeutic interventions may greatly help to minimize the formation of complex comorbid psychiatric conditions and reduce the potential for suicidal acts among high-risk populations.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Temperament and character are terms utilized to delineate the participation of biologic and psychosocial factors in the development of normal and disordered personality. At times, biological factors, and in others rearing, education, psychological and social events at an early age are the main determinants. The American Psychiatric Association describes Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) as characterized by a pattern of interpersonal, self-image and affective instability, as well as notable impulsivity. In this disorder, temperament as an inherited factor plays an important role, as demonstrated by familial studies in which the disorder is more frequently present in the families of probands than non-probands. Other disorders where impulsivity is an outstanding feature, such as antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse, are also frequent in first degree relatives of patients with BPD. Psychological factors, such as sexual abuse during childhood, are particularly high in this disorder. This is believed to generate features such as emotional instability, distrust, and dissociative states. From this point of view, it is possible that BPD is a form of “adaptation” not only psychological and behavioral, but also biological. Changes in the volume of the amygdala and hippocampus have been described in the brain of women abused during childhood, and those with BPD. BPD is frequently present in clinical practice, either or not associated to other psychiatric disorders; it can be found anywhere from 11 to 40.4% according to the setting studied. This incidence is even higher in patients with multiple suicide attempts. The term “borderline” was established when this pathological condition was conceptualized to originate between neurosis and psychosis. However, current understanding of personality is better explained with a psychobiological model based on various dimensions. There is one related to schizophrenia (cognitive-perceptual organization dimension) and others related to mood disorders (mood regulation dimension), impulse control (impulsivity-aggression dimension), and anxiety disorders (anxiety-inhibition dimension). Patients with BPD show persistent disturbance on the four dimensions. The combination of these disturbances, along with specific defense mechanisms and coping strategies, originate the characteristic behaviors of individuals with BPD. Regarding the first dimension (cognitive-perceptual organization), BPD patients manifest paranoid ideation and dissociative symptoms usually under severe stress. It is possible that frontal lobe functioning is compromised due to a reactive dopamine and norepinephrine surge in the prefrontal lobe. The disturbance in the second dimension (mood regulation) is manifested in BPD by rapid mood shifts due to excessive sensitivity to separation, frustration and criticism. Although present in all cluster B personality disorders, mood instability in BPD is responsible for stormy relationships, self-image and self-esteem fluctuations, constant rage and bad temper, physical fights, and feelings of emptiness. This mood instability seems to be related to a serotonin effect on the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems. Disturbances in the third dimension (impulsivity-aggression) originate a lack of control in the use of alcohol and/or drugs, as well as binge eating, reckless driving, shopping sprees, suicide gesture/attempts, self mutilation, and uncontrollable/inappropri-ate anger. Most studies note the inverse relationship between serotonin levels, and impulsivity, aggression, and self-harm behavior. Finally, abnormalities in the fourth dimension (anxiety-inhibition) manifest as themselves frantic attempts to prevent real or imaginary abandonment. No neurobiological substrate has been proposed in this dimension. The growing evidence of neurobiological basis favors the utilization of pharmacological agents in the treatment of BPD. This paper reviews available publications on controlled clinical trials, hoping to provide a guide in the prescription of psychopharmacological agents to the patient with BPD. These patients can benefit from pharmacological treatment for impulsivity, psychotic states, affective instability and depression.",

      "abstract": "Subthreshold psychotic experiences are widely reported within otherwise healthy populations. Their phenomenology is broad and very heterogeneous ranging from meaningful coincidences and precognitive dreams over haunting to out-of-body experiences and visual as well as auditory hallucinations. Although creative aspects of these experiences are implied too, a similarity in form and content to positive symptoms in schizophrenia (e.g., delusion, disordered thought, and hallucinations) or schizotypy (e.g. magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, ideas of reference or paranoid ideation) seems to be obvious. However, the borderline between normal and pathological experiences and behaviour is unclear. The so called “continuum approach” assumes that schizophrenia or schizotypy are not discrete or categorical illness entities. It implies a gradient in the severity of the symptoms, ranging from healthy population to full-blown schizophrenia. As such, psychotic signs are no longer restricted to formal diagnoses according to DSM or ICD, but would, instead, complete the spectrum of psychological and biological features that characterize individual variations among human beings. Can subthreshold psychotic experiences be integrated in this continuum? Do individuals indicating such experiences lack some social cognitive abilities and are particularly vulnerable to false inferences in their social world. How are these experiences related to increased neural activity or an abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission? These and similar questions will be discussed in the presentation.

However, early rehabilitation does not seem to resolve all the problems. Social losses and social deterioration are found in more than half of schizophrenic patients already in prodrome phase i.e. before the onset of the first psychotic episode. Further on, every relapse, several months of disease and hospitalizations frequently disrupt education, cause losing jobs and breaking relations, social withdrawal and also disability. Environmental and social factors may facilitate the development of chronic conditions and increasing defect via their interaction with the personality and the disease. Not infrequently the rehabilitation process may lag behind and certain possibilities may be missed. There is also a gap between the rehabilitation concepts and sociopsychological characteristics of specific age groups of psychiatric patients. The author presents the concept of psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) using schizophrenic patients as an example and emphasizes the following aspects: 1) PSR in an essential component of care on every stage that follows treatment, throughout the whole course of disease; 2) psychosocial interventions and social support are aimed at both preserving social capacities of the patient and prevention of social losses in future; 3) complex therapy in combination with consequent psychosocial (both group and individual) patient-centered interventions involving also family and social network of the patient is used along with other methods of social recovery; 4) with regard for the mentioned one can distinguish the most problematic patients groups, specifically: a) those in initial phase of disease (first 5 years), b) patients with frequent hospitalizations, c) those with unstable labor adjustment, d) single persons, e) those staying in hospital too long; and 5) in adolescence and in young age the purpose of rehabilitation is not only winning back the social positions but also restoration of the patient's personality and his social self; while in older age coping with negative effects of getting older and acceptation of new social roles are becoming more important.",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a condition characterized by early-onset challenges in social interaction and communication, alongside inflexible and repetitive behaviors and interests, forming the basis for diagnosis. The disease typically begins to show or is diagnosed around the age of two. Early signs may include hyperactivity, lack of focus, and tantrums that can be alleviated by music. In adulthood, individuals with this condition often struggle to cope with the responsibilities of daily life, find it challenging to socialize, and may feel isolated and lacking in friendships. They may develop addictions or strong attachments to specific objects or routines.These symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria, which include qualitative impairments in social interaction and communication, along with restricted and repetitive interests and activities. It's crucial to recognize the non-social aspects of the condition, such as narrow interests, preference for routine, and heightened attention to detail",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Social Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is the fear of public scenarios leading to avoidance of social situations or causing individuals to endure intense feelings of anxiety. SAD impedes a person's ability to interact with the world around them. Research evidence to date suggests potential causes of SAD include psychological factors (serious family conflict, abuse, or extremely disturbing events), environmental factors especially in children (excessive teasing, bullying, rejection at home, school or work, or ridicule), developmental factors (temperament, physical appearance, or conditions which attract attention), brain structure, and genetic variations. This is complicated by the fact that about 90% of the people suffering from SAD also suffer from other disorders. People suffering from SAD may also suffer with other disorders such as major depressive disorder related to chronic isolation, other anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorder, schizophrenia, and some eating disorders which cause the person to avoid eating in front of others. SAD will typically develop before other disorders, except for individual phobias and separation anxiety disorder. In 2022, the American Psychiatric Association published ten criteria for use in diagnosing SAD. The World Health Organization identified differences between impairment patterns in countries, however similarities emerged including onset at a young age, persistence, impairment, and that the threshold for diagnosis is very close irrespective of geography or income levels. People suffering from SAD improve from two types of medical treatment used separately or together: psychotherapy (talk therapy to change ways people think and act) and medications to relieve symptoms (antianxiety, antidepressants, and a beta-blocker for heart-related symptoms). The use of medications is predominantly safe and effective, although it may take trying several different drugs to identify the best ones for a patient. The use of complementary and alternative medicine is expanding and includes relaxation techniques, meditation, yoga, and logging or journaling. Complementary health care is used alongside conventional medicine, while alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. Combating SAD is more important now because of the COVID-19 pandemic but there have been great strides towards alleviating symptoms and improving the lives of those affected.",

      "abstract": "This chapter offers a guided tour of the anguished, puzzling, scary, and, at times, darkly erotic mental zoo. It covers a large terrain of psychiatric symptomatology involving animals, stopping at the scenic spots of delusions and hallucinations; confusional states; lycanthropy; culture-bound psychiatric syndromes; obsessions and phobias; personality disorders; sexual perversions; and childhood psychiatric disorders. In societies where animals are in closer contact with humans, they are perhaps more readily drawn into the psyche as projective containers for unacceptable sexual impulses, sadomasochism, guilt, fear, and shame. Although fleeting concerns involving animals may appear in all types of anxiety reactions, the anxiety disorder par excellence involving animals is simple phobia. Psychiatric symptomatology involving animals is also found in association with personality disorders. \"Bestiality,\" or sexual contact with animals, usually occurs in association with predisposing cultural factors, lower levels of education, and schizoid tendencies. Animals also make their appearance in the course of psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.",

In contrast to what have been previously described as “subaffective disorders,” the condition presented here develops later in life, after a premorbid history of high social function and after long-lasting stresses or multiple losses before onset. Long-term course is that of an affective disorder, sometimes ending in suicide if not treated. It is also suggested that these patients undergo a process of regression under the influence of a chronic exposure to stress. The condition was initially observed among Eastern European immigrant patients but may also occur among individuals in high-stress jobs. The name “pseudoborderline syndrome” is proposed and it is speculated that masked affective disorders may appear in the form of “pseudo-syndromes”—pseudodementia, pseudomania, pseudohypochondriasis, pseudoborderline.",

      "abstract": "Five pre-school children with variability in the quality of their social relationships, unusual or abnormal speech and/or expressive language, and ritualistic or manneristic behaviors, were diagnosed as having an atypical pervasive developmental disorder. In order to study the natural history of this disorder these children were followed-up 10 years later. Four of the adolescents showed evidence of the persistence of social and communicative disorders consistent with a diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder (PDDNOS), while one was found to have a social phobia and the residual state of the PDDNOS. One of the PDD adolescents was actively psychotic. We find that young children diagnosed as having a pervasive developmental disorder with atypical features can have thinking disorders and/or poor reality testing which persists into adolescence, and can develop symptoms of childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. The overall cognitive functioning of young children diagnosed as having a pervasive developmental disorder with atypical features tends to be stable or perhaps even improve somewhat as they grow into adolescence. Parents are aware of, and can report, the presence of severe emotional and/or behavioral disturbance in such adolescents. The marked similarities in symptomatology, clinical course, and treatment histories, between this group and a group of adolescents who were not diagnosed as having a PDD until adolescence, suggests that there may be an underreporting or underdiagnosis of young children with pervasive developmental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Relapse can be defined as \"the return of a disease after partial recovery\". This definition is directly applicable to schizophrenic disorder. Relapse in this condition can be evaluated at the symptomatic, phenomenological and behavioural levels. Relapse impinges on inter-personal, social and occupational spheres of the patient's activity. In turn, relapse has wider implications for the family in general, for the provision of medical and social facilities and for health economics. There are no generally accepted criteria for relapse but outcomes such as violence or suicide, extreme psychotic behaviour and rehospitalization have been used. Less obvious criteria include major and minor symptom worsening and prodromata. Relapse is a relative term and must take into account the following factors: the patient's condition before the original onset of illness; his level of functioning before the present episode; the severity of the relapse in terms of symptom severity, duration and interference with personal functioning; the appearance of any new symptoms or behaviour patterns; the type of treatment given prior to relapse, and hence relatively ineffective; the type of treatment given during relapse, and its efficacy. Relapses often follow a pattern which may be fairly specific to each individual patient. Social factors may have predictive power but these need validation in different samples.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be described as a disease where speech, bodily language and social responsiveness are obvious expressions of a deteriorated ability to interact with the surroundings in a precise and relevant way. The lack of precision and relevance pertains to perception and recall as well as communication and action. The deficient potential for activation of the prefrontal cerebral cortex is a neurobiological correlate to the lesion of precise and relevant planning and expression. Impairment of formal thought and language in schizophrenia are suggested to result from a developmental disorder pertaining to language and concept formation (apperception). In reactive psychoses with dissociative disturbances of consciousness there is an inefficient capacity for adapting to external reality; thus relevant conscious planning and interaction with the outside world are impaired. Clinically a distractibility of a tematic nature ensues. Except for catastrophic events, psychotic reactions cannot be predicted from analysis of the actual experience--neither concerning the external nor the internal aspects of conscious awareness. Sometimes, however, previous events relating to the formation of the self may add explanatory value to the analysis of reactive psychosis. In some cases biological predisposition is the decisive determinant. The normal discrimination between sense-perception and imagination has a counterpart in the dichotomy of awareness of the outside world versus awareness of the self. The following are examples of psychotic experience where the normal ability for dichotomic discrimination may be damaged: Illusions of affect, hallucinations, Schneider's first rank symptoms, \"Anwesenheit\" and consciousness of time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

Problems developing a secure attachment, or with separation and individuation, can lead to insecure ambivalent attachments and problems with development of identity and sense of self. If these problems progress into adulthood, there will be a poor sense of self, poorly formed identity and associated problems with self-esteem.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe, frequent, heterogeneous, longlasting and disabling chronic mental illness with high social impact, belonging to the group of chronic psychoses. There are several clinical forms and several possible evolutionary modes. Its etiopathogenesis is multifactorial (hereditary, biological, environmental, etc.) but no single cause has been demonstrated up till now. Schizophrenia is a group of disabling heterogeneous disorders that are generally severe, the course of which is chronic and disabling, and the prognosis is poor. Many retrospective studies have attempted to trace the premorbid history of adult subjects who developed schizophrenia. Their results appear to be extremely disparate, due in particular to the heterogeneity of the means of investigation used. In addition, in recent years, many studies have focused on prodromal symptoms occurring during the year preceding the first psychotic episode in late adolescence or early adulthood. Minor physical cranio-cerebral (at the level of the ears, the palate, the cranial perimeter), temporomandibular, dental and palatal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic disturbances or even subtle neurological signs have been frequently found in schizophrenic patients, in particular oral anomalies, more precisely the measurements of the teeth, their vestibulo-lingual and mesio-distal diameters. The objective of our article is to study the morphological abnormalities that exist in the patient with schizophrenia, and to demonstrate whether there is a link between the presence of these physical abnormalities and the occurrence of schizophrenia. This issue has been vaguely mentioned in the literature, but in the Moroccan context, it is a pilot study.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for duration of more than a day and less than a month.The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors.This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors.Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional liability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one.Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months.Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females.Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history.In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event.Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor.In this case report, we present a fifteen (15) year old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

The educational level, living conditions and living together with the relatives do not exert any material effect on the intensity of the clinico-psychopathological manifestations.

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

It is impossible to consider diagnostic indications (that the symptoms of schizophrenia couldn’t be observed before and during actual examination) sufficient to explain the special place of this mental disorder. Some criteria of diagnosis of schizotypal disorders (for example, suspiciousness and paranoid ideas, episodes of quazi- psychotic disorders) are not applicable. With the aim to define the clinical features of schizotypal personality disorder 58 patients were examined. All patients were characterized by mainly personality disorders. Results - Schizotypal personality disorder is similar to deficit states, observed at schizophrenia, clinically limited to personality sphere, without the signs of flow of endogenous process and psychotic disorders. - Schizotypal personality disorder on the clinical content reminds schizoid, but insignificant ideatory disorders are rather typical. Dymamic of psychopathy - disposition to decompensation - is never observed. - Schizotypal personality disorder can be diagnosed as latent, prodromal schizophrenia, because the clinical picture of these states is very similar. The special value acquires a dynamic aspect, allowing to find the signs of «flow» and dynamics typical of the endogenous process. Conclusion Thus, the main differencial diagnosing criteria of schizotypal personality disorder are the dynamic aspects and changing of clinical features.",

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AUTO-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLSCENTS",
      "abstract": "There are various external factors that cause feelings, favorable for the formation of suicidal behavior: misunderstanding, meaningful rejection by others, experienced abuse, loneliness, alienation; loss of parental love, love – the key negative emotions are jea-lousy, death, divorce, escape from the family of some of the parents – despair, insult, jealousy; contempt, amazed selfishness – insult, anger, hatred, aggression as a desire to revenge, etc. It has been established that approximately half of examples of suicidal youth behavior are associated with destructive family problems, with a negative attitude towards them.Interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict in the conditions of social, psychological, existential crisis on the background of mental disadaptation can acquire a suicidogenic character. In all cases, the crucial moment in the formation of manifestation of suicidal behavior is precisely a suicidogenic conflict. Adoption of a suicidal decision (regardless of the causes, conditions, forms of maladaptation) occurs only after the phase of personal re-development of suicidogenic conflict.In our study, the group of suicide risk is totally 27.2 %. Researchers from this risk group are less readers of books, play computer games, attend interest groups, but are more on the streets and do their home affairs. They have significantly more problems with their father, mother, brothers and sisters, and their peers. They are mostly dissatisfied with the degree of realization of material and spiritual needs in their family. In the vast majority of high school students of the risk group, there are high levels of anxiety and mental and physical exhaustion, the experience of loneliness, hopelessness, irrationality of existence.In a greater number of senior pupils-licetists a factor of high anxiety was the fear of not meeting the expectations of others. Analysis of the data of the questionnaires of high school students of the risk group allowed to highlight and describe the main variants of individual images of states that can lead to auto-aggressive behavior of young people. The most striking feature is the sense of guilt, which arises as a result of inadequate assessment of one’s own actions or intentions, numerous, often groundless, self-excuse, hyperbolization of their mistakes, impairment of achievements, reproach of conscientiousness, and the desire to get out of life.",

BPD is not only common in psychiatric populations but also more prevalent in the general community than previously thought, and thus represents an important public health issue. In contrast to most psychiatric disorders, some symptoms associated with BPD may improve over time, even without therapy, though impaired social functioning and interpersonal disturbances in close relationships often persist. Another counterintuitive and insufficiently resolved question is why depressive symptoms and risk-taking behaviors can occur simultaneously in the same individual. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate about the nosological position of BPD, which impacts on research regarding sex differences in clinical presentation and patterns of comorbidity. In this review, it is argued that many features of BPD may be conceptualized within an evolutionary framework, namely behavioral ecology. According to Life History Theory, BPD reflects a pathological extreme or distortion of a behavioral 'strategy' which unconsciously aims at immediate exploitation of resources, both interpersonal and material, based on predictions shaped by early developmental experiences. Such a view is consistent with standard medical conceptualizations of BPD, but goes beyond classic 'deficit'-oriented models, which may have profound implications for therapeutic approaches.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy on Shyness: Influence of Age",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONShyness may be defined experientially as excessive self-focus characterized by negative self-evaluation that creates discomfort and/or inhibition in social situations and interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. The experience of shyness can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive, affective, physiological and behavioural and may be triggered by a wide variety of situational cues (Henderson and Zimbardo, 1998). Among the most typical situations are interactions with authorities and strangers, one on one opposite sex interactions, and unstructured social settings. Subcategories of shyness reflect the degree (i.e., mild social awkwardness to totally inhibiting social phobia) and frequency of experienced shyness and include chronic shyness (self-labeling as shy and the experience of shyness in numerous social situations), situational shyness (the experience of shyness in specific social situations), and shy extroverts (experience anxiety and negative self-evaluation but are publicly outgoing).Shyness, often start in adolescence and is centered on a fear of scrutiny by other people in comparatively small groups (as opposed to crowds), usually leading to avoidance of social situation (Schmidt et al., 1997). According to various statistics, around 40 to 50 percent of the people (and sometimes more) are involved in shyness. Shyness evokes negative effect, which leads to sadness, unhappiness and fearfulness, and tendency to describe oneself as 'shy natured' is associated with low global self esteem and with feelings of low self worth in several domains of the self (Crozier, 1995). Shy adolescents tended to be lower in self-esteem, more introverted, and more anxious than their non-shy counterparts (Lawrence and Bennett, 1992). Shy individuals also tend to lack confidence (Crozier, 1982), and express larger perceived skill deficits compared to non-shy individuals (Jackson et al., 1997). A common observation in virtually all shyness research is that the consequences of shyness are deeply troubling. A general observation in most of the shyness research is that the consequences of shyness are deeply troubling shyness leads to higher levels of anxiety (D'Souza, 2003), fear (D'Souza, Gowda and Gowda, 2006), depression and loneliness (Somesha and D'Souza, 2008, 2009).Researchers in India and abroad have proposed several treatment approaches to shyness from medication to life skills intervention to psychotherapy. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) theory is a method to understand and treat dysfunctional emotions and behaviors. It is a cognitive-behavioral approach that posits that inappropriate behaviors result not from an event but rather from irrational beliefs. REBT asserts that irrational beliefs lead to unhealthy negative emotions and behaviors, such as rage and guilt (Jensen, 2008). The present study is aimed at finding out the effectiveness of REBT on shyness among early and late adolescents in India.METHODSampleA large sample of adolescents (N=1200) between 12-18 years was screened for Shyness Assessment Test (SAT) and the samples who had high levels of shyness (scores more than 72) were selected. Next, the researcher selected 96 adolescents randomly and assigned them for the intervention of the study, 48 as experimental group and 48 students as control group. There were 24 early and 24 late adolescents in each group. The experimental group was administered REBT, while the control group was not given any specific intervention.ToolThe Shyness Assessment Test (SAT) was developed by D'Souza (2006) of Maharaja's College, University of Mysore. It consisted of 54 items and requires the subject to indicate his/her response by marking YES, NO or CAN'T SAY. The items in the test pertained to three domains of shyness-Cognitive/Affective, Physiological and Action oriented. Item analysis of the scale using SPSS program resulted in Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0. …",

      "title": "Reactive Psychoses Revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "abstract": "Relationships among different symptom domains were investigated in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia with depressive symptoms, psychotic depression, or schizoaffective disorder, depressive subtype. Scores for depression and depressive factors were correlated with positive, negative, and extrapyramidal symptoms within diagnostic categories. No between-group differences in the relationship of different symptom domains could be found, and no substantial relationship between depression and positive symptoms could be revealed in any diagnostic subgroup. Only the retardation factor of depression showed a significant overlap with negative symptoms; depressive core symptoms did not. Core symptoms of depression were independent from other symptoms in all investigated diagnostic groups. Depression seems to represent a heterogeneous symptom domain with unique relationships of components to positive and negative symptoms across nosological borders. A more differentiated assessment, analysis, and treatment of depressive symptoms is therefore recommended for patients with combined depressive and psychotic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Various factors contribute to a predisposition towards the excessive consumption of alcohol: socio-demographic factors, a disturbed family background or certain neurological disorders in childhood, a family background of heavy drinking or total abstinence, or a genetic predisposition towards the biochemical reactions of excessive drinking. Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

      "title": "Dissociation And Its Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dissociation is a ubiquitous psychic process, differentiated from the psychopathology of dissociative disorders. Dissociation may be defensive, adaptive, or protective, and may serve multiple functions. Clinically, dissociation generally involves denial, isolation, and various forms of splitting of the self and the go. Altered states of consciousness are characteristic of dissociation. Dissociative disorder may be transient or enduring, entailing division of the personality without fill conscious awareness of the divided self. Dissociative disorders are typically a consequence of severe, protracted trauma, or a serious disturbance of the infantile primary object relationship. These disorders are closely associated with borderline personality, propensity for regression, and significant disturbance of identity and reality. Clinical illustrations of dissociate disorder here include an adult bipolar patient with a severely traumatic childhood, and an adult male who experienced traumatic childhood mother-son incest in a highly dysfunctional family. While dissociative disorders are maladaptive, dissociation may paradoxically facilitate novel self-object configurations, imagination, and creativity.

I am particularly familiar with the case report, having discussed the patient's analysis with the analyst who conducted the treatment.",

Less effective (or even destructive) treatments have been seized upon, in part because they do not require understanding patients. Understanding them means facing facts about ourselves, our families, and our society that we do not want to know, or, in the case of repressed feelings and experiences, do not want to know again. This reluctance to understand is particularly tragic in the case of the acutely disturbed college student, whose crisis may lead either to reorganization at a higher level of functioning and growth or to a wasted life. The central role of terror in producing symptoms and the genesis and handling of symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations, are briefly discussed.",

      "title": "Psychological management of dissociative disorder",
      "abstract": "Sir, Dissociative disorders often arise as a coping mechanism in response to severe trauma, such as abuse or exposure to highly distressing events. The manifestations can range from mild to severe and may include symptoms like amnesia, identity confusion, depersonalization, and derealization. Understanding and diagnosing dissociative disorders require careful examination of the individual's personal history, experiences, and symptoms, with treatment often involving psychotherapy to address underlying trauma and promote integration of fragmented aspects of the self.[1,2] A 21-year-old unmarried Hindu girl presented with complaints of sleep disturbances, fearfulness, episodes of unresponsiveness, and anxiety, with a duration of illness spanning 3 years. Along with her psychiatric treatment, she was referred for psychotherapy. Upon exploring her history, it was revealed that she had experienced childhood abuse trauma, including a neighbor's attempted sexual molestation. In addition, her father was described as dominating and unwilling to listen to anyone in the family, and the patient harbored a deep fear of him. Despite her apprehension, she initially refrained from disclosing these experiences to her parents. However, as her situation worsened, she began to have nightmares, became increasingly fearful, started avoiding family functions, and struggled with excessive sweating during public interactions. Her self-esteem gradually declined, leading to an inability to take initiative in any activities, ultimately resulting in her dropping out of her studies. Negative thoughts began to pervade her mind, and she experienced frequent episodes of unresponsiveness. Assessment of the problem through behavior analysis, family interaction system, and support system was done systematically. She had a mild level of depression on the Beck Depression Inventory and a moderate level of anxiety on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. The goal of the intervention package was to encourage and prepare her to confront challenging situations, by addressing her avoidance behaviors and anxiety by altering negative thought patterns, thereby diminishing feelings of inferiority and fostering an increase in self-esteem. This was achieved through a series of 13 sessions conducted over 10 weeks, accompanied by regular follow-ups spanning 3 months. Each session, lasting 1 h, commenced with an explanation and reassurance to the patient regarding the necessity of therapeutic intervention, followed by a collaborative discussion of the approach. The patient's family members were provided with psycho-education about the patient's current situation, including causative factors and prognosis. To alleviate the patient's anxiety, deep breathing exercises were taught and training was consistently provided in each session, with the patient instructed to practice at home. The patient's interest area was identified through externalization, and she was encouraged to engage in activities to enhance her self-esteem. Subsequent sessions focused on cognitive restructuring to address negative thoughts and faulty cognitions. The patient was guided to challenge these negative thoughts in a rational and objective manner on her own. In the final phase, family counseling was conducted, involving the patient's father and mother. They were urged to provide support and assistance in helping the patient overcome feelings of guilt and self-blame. A marked improvement was seen in the patient after 13 sessions. Dissociative (conversion) disorders typically exhibit no discernible physical or neurological issues and share common characteristics involving either partial or complete disruptions in memory, identity awareness, sensory experiences, or control over body movements. These episodes frequently coincide with traumatic life events or heightened psychological stress. Psycho-education proved to be very useful in understanding the dynamics of the patient's problems, as well as enabling the patient to proceed in a positive direction with the help of emotional support.[3] There was a decrease in anxiety and distress with the focus on deep breathing exercises.[4] Through family counseling, the role and importance of family support system were also explained. Reassurance and externalization of interest help her improve self-esteem.[5] Lastly, her irrational beliefs and fear were restructured with the cognitive restructuring method.[6] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

Affective disorders only infrequently begin in childhood and the behavioural percursors of adult depression do not constitute a clearly recognisable pattern. However, adverse experiences in childhood may create a vulnerability to later depression. The child-adult linkages are strongest with conduct disturbance in childhood and adult personality disorder, the mechanisms in this continuity are probably both constitutional and environmental.",

      "title": "[Aggressive behavior: theoretical and biological aspects].",
      "abstract": "The susceptibility to aggression may manifest differently depending on the psychological context in which it occurs. In the context of psychopathy, characterized by a lack of empathy, this may manifest in aggression with criminal acts, which is characteristic of antisocial personality disorder. When the susceptibility is associated with psychotic impairment, aggression may be manifested in highly deviant behavior, like murder or serial killing. While the great majority of persons with schizophrenia do not commit violent acts, clinicians suggest that some schizophrenics may pose a risk in the community, particularly those patients with co-occurring substance abuse diagnoses, those who are noncompliant with prescribed psychiatric treatment, and those with a history of frequent relapses resulting in hospitalization or arrest. Episodic violence and aggression often accompany dementia. When coupled with emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression often occurs in an interpersonal context, as in borderline personality disorder. However, the most common comorbidity is the substance abuse disorder, which contributes to both the cognitive distortions and disinhibition associated with the substance use. According to the biological data, aggression seems to emerge when the drive of limbic-mediated affective prefrontal response to provocative producing stimuli is insufficiently constrained by inhibition. Thus, excessive reactivity in the amygdale, coupled with inadequate prefrontal regulation, increase the possibility of aggressive behavior. The PET/SPECT studies focusing on schizophrenia have shown reduced activity in fronto-temoral circuitry. The fMRI studies concord with the hypothesis that among violent persons with schizophrenia, those with sociopathetic features and/or substance abuse constitute a highly different subgroup, in which cognitive, neurological and behavioral patterns are more closely associated with the personality traits than schizophrenia. It is known that serotonin facilitates prefrontal inhibition and insufficient serotonergic activity may increase aggression levels. Gabaminergic activity reduce subcortical reactivity, and thus reduced gabaminergic activity may increase aggression. In addition, agonism of 5-HT2A receptor may increase impulsivity levels, while 5-HT2C receptor agonism may decrease it. An imbalance between these receptors with increased serotonergic activity at the 5-HT2A receptor and decreased 5-HT2C receptor sensitivity may increase the possibility of aggression. Fluoxetine may reserve this pattern by increasing presynaptic availability, decreasing 5-HT2A binding and enhancing signal at 5-HT2C receptors. Similarly, atypical antipsychotics, which in parallel with the D2 antagonism have a prominent 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, manifest significant antiaggressive properties. In addition mood stabilizers, affecting glutamatergic/gabaminergic balance, serve to the reduction of impulsive aggression, while lithium manifests positive effect on both suicidality and impulsive aggression.",

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are frequently reported during the period preceding the onset of schizophrenia in adolescents when such symptoms can be mistaken for those of mood disorder. However, it is unclear which emotional symptoms should be considered predictive of schizophrenia onset. The types of emotional disturbances that may precede schizophrenic disorder were sought through a review of historical descriptive studies and seminal works using a phenomenological approach. Five main types of emotional disturbances have been found as prodromal symptoms of a schizophrenic disorder: (1) increased sensitivity to stress, (2) poor or incomplete expression of emotions, (3) reduced emotion sharing, (4) emotional detachment, and (5) disconnection between the perception and expression of emotions. Studies based on phenomenological views of schizophrenic disorders stressed the chronological sequence of these symptoms in the same person. For example, the term “delusional mood” (Wahnstimmung) coined to describe changes in the perceived atmosphere encompass mood disturbances from subtle emotional overreactivity to more severe symptoms that could evoke athymhormia. Analysis of recent studies among subjects at high-risk for psychotic transition showed that the presence of mood symptoms at a very early stage of the disorder is common. While these symptoms predict a lower level of general functioning, they were not associated with a higher risk of developing a schizophrenic disorder at follow-up.

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Paranoia and Paranoid Beliefs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Paranoia has at various times been considered a symptom of psychosis, a distinct disorder, a type of personality disorder, and a personality trait. However defined, the core features are interpersonal vulnerability, mistrust, and the anticipation of harm from malevolent others which, in its most severe form, can be considered delusional. There have been persisting debates about whether delusional paranoia reflects a qualitatively distinct mental state, as indicated by some phenomenological studies, or lies on a continuum with ordinary suspiciousness. Little is known about the genetics of paranoia, but there is substantial evidence that it is associated with specific social challenges such as disrupted early attachment relationships, living in deprived circumstances, and experiences of victimization. Considerable progress has also been made in developing psychological models which identify the cognitive (jumping to conclusions and bias against disconfirmatory information) and emotional factors (low self-esteem and insecure attachment styles) that contribute to paranoid beliefs.",

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

It is often associated with sensory dysfunctions, other neurodevelopmental disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy and/or sleep disorders. This condition will accompany people throughout their lives, with variations in its evolution. In the last ten years, only 1% of all autism research focused on developing post-secondary education programs and training in adult health services. Taking into account this dichotomy of interests, we must think about the different stages of life, such as early intervention, school inclusion, bullying, associated mental and medical disorders, lack of group belonging, job opportunities and the aging. Only by becoming aware of each of them can we achieve a better quality of life for people with autism and their families.El autismo es un trastorno del neurodesarrollo de base neurobiológica caracterizado por déficits en la cognición social y la comunicación, intereses restringidos y conductas estereotipadas.

      "abstract": "Intellectual disability is a mental disorder which appears during the developmental period in childhood and continues life-long. It is characterized by intellectual deficits on the one side and maladaptive social functioning on the other. The intellectual deficits include problems in abstract and logic thinking, problem solving, reasoning, learning from experience and judging. The deficits in adaptive functioning appear in problems in social communication and participation as well as in mental overload phenomena caused by daily life activities. This overload often results in psychopathological features and psychosocial reactions which are usually observed in Burn-out-Syndromes as e.g. general exhaustion (depletion of primarily reduced mental resources), additional reduced efficacy (accompanied by feelings of insufficiency and poor self-esteem), and most typically feelings alienation (towards intrinsically familiar situations, towards relatives and friends and at least also against oneself ) typically accompanied by irritability and dysphoria. Treatment programs therefore should not only focus on intellectual deficits but should include also the multiple sufferings from psychopathological phenomena and psychosocial effects of such daily life overload syndromes.

      "title": "Social cognition in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder, incorporating a wide range of symptoms that may occur at certain stages of the disease. The core symptoms can largely be divided into positive symptoms, e.g. hallucinations and delusions, and negative symptoms, e.g. apathia and emotional flattening. Schizophrenia is also known to be associated with social cognitive impairments. In particular, emotion recognition, i.e., the ability to infer emotional information from facial expressions, and theory of mind (ToM), i.e., the ability to infer the intentions and beliefs of other individuals, appear to be for schizophrenia important domains of social cognition, because they are valid predictors of social functioning of the patients. This thesis describes five studies on social cognition in schizophrenia. First, in a family study including schizophrenia patients and their siblings, we show that social cognitive impairments are related to schizophrenia symptoms. Suggestive of a common familial basis, social cognitive functioning clusters between siblings. Second, in a longitudinal study investigating emotion recognition in schizophrenia patients, we show that emotion recognition impairments are present in non-acute stages of the illness. However, the study also shows further deterioration of emotion recognition deficits during acute phases of the disorder. Third, in a study investigating brain structures using Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques, we show that reduced prefrontal cortex, but not amygdala gray matter volume is associated with social cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Fourth, in an epidemiological study investigating Quality of Life (QOL) of patients, we show that ToM rather than emotion recognition is associated with QOL, and this association is moderated by schizophrenia symptoms. In particular, patients with relatively unimpaired ToM and more severe schizophrenia symptoms have poor QOL. Insight could be a possible explanation for the findings, i.e., more severely ill patients with relatively unimpaired ToM may be more aware of the effects of their illness on their social environment. In the final study of this thesis, we investigate the effects of two anti-psychotic medications, i.e., aripiprazole versus risperidone, on social cognition in schizophrenia. In an eight week open-label trial we show that aripiprazole and risperidone have similar impact on social cognitive performance. However, aripiprazole treatment has a greater effect on patients’ processing speed compared to treatment with risperidone. Taken together, this thesis contributes to the knowledge on social cognition and its structural brain correlates in schizophrenia and elucidates associations between social cognitive performance and both QOL and anti-psychotic drug therapy. The current findings show that social cognition in schizophrenia is a relevant construct for basic science as well as clinical practice and, therefore, deserves attention of future research.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

      "title": "Late Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Diagnosis: A New Perspective on Life",
      "abstract": "Introduction Autism Spectrum Disorder is usually diagnosed in early childhood, but an increasing number of adults are identified as autistic later in life (Huang et al., 2020). Many experience frustration due to missed early intervention opportunities. The lack of recognition of their condition during childhood or adolescence may have contributed to secondary mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression or low self-esteem, complicating the adjustment process after diagnosis (Bargiela et al., 2019). However, providing appropriate support can enhance their quality of life and promote better mental health outcomes. Objectives To assess the patient’s clinical case to identify autism spectrum disorder in older adulthood. Methods A 23-year-old male patient complained of an inability to concentrate, stress and fear when around people, and difficulties in social situations. Objectively observed: stereotyped movements, noticeable anxiety, avoidance of eye contact, non-compliance with social rules, specific language use and slow thinking. The patient had no history of diagnosed psychiatric illness. Since childhood, he has disliked the feeling of clothes touching his body, physical contact with others, making eye contact. The patient also exhibited impaired social development, being unable to initiate and maintain relationships with peers. Stereotypical, repetitive movements, sensory processing deviations have been observed since childhood. The patient has various phobias from a young age. Psychological examination revealed insufficient attention with observed fluctuations, impaired attention-shifting ability. The pace is very slow, the thinking is characterized by an average level of generalization, concreteness, and stereotypy. Personality traits included rigidity, depression, compulsiveness, internal tension. Based on the clinical picture and psychological tests, the patient was diagnosed with F84.0 Autistic Disorder, according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision. In this case, the following methods were used in the assessment: Kraepelin’s and Schulte’s methods, pictograms, the 4-1 method, the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Results The literature highlights that ASD involves difficulties in social interaction, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, and distinct thinking patterns. Up to 90% of individuals with ASD experience sensory irregularities, which is consistent with this case, as the patient shows social challenges, repetitive movements, slow thinking, and sensory issues. Diagnosing autism in adulthood can improve quality of life by fostering understanding and access to support. In this case, the patient’s past social and workplace difficulties may be attributed to autism, guiding the development of effective support strategies. Conclusions In conclusion, while a late autism diagnosis can be life-changing, it also comes with unique challenges that must be addressed through appropriate support.

      "title": "Some Aspects of Social Phobia and its Relationship with Substance use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Social Phobia (SP) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorder, characterized by overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations. People with social phobia have an intense, persistent, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and of doing things that will embarrass them. This excessive anxiety usually leads to avoidance behavior that can severely affect normal daily living. SP usually begins in childhood or early adolescence. There is some evidence that genetic factors are involved. A number of studies have emphasized the high co-morbidity of social phobia with a number of other psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. Though clearly elevated there is much debate as to the nature of this relationship. Substance abuse may develop if people try to self-medicate their anxiety and make thamselves more comfortable in social situations. Anxiety may be a result of alcohol or drug abuse due to a substance's anxiogenic effects or through protracted withdrawal syndromes. Substance abusers incur more pathological and unstable life circumstances, making them more susceptible to future stress and anxiety; and there may be a genetic susceptibility in some people which makes them vulnerable to both disorders. The purpose of this article is to summarize research findings on SP and its complex relationship with substance use disorder. Clinical anxiety and substance abuse both warrant treatment and in all likelihood, each helps perpetuate the other.",

We found that these three categories could be distinguished from each other on some clinical parameters. Late-onset schizophrenia was characterized by bizarre delusions; auditory hallucinations; to a lesser degree, first-rank and negative symptoms; and premorbid personality of the paranoid or schizoid type. Paraphrenia was associated with predominantly nonbizarre delusions, auditory hallucinations, earlier onset of symptoms, and paranoid or schizoid personality. Paranoia (late-onset) was characterized by late onset of symptoms, nonbizarre delusions, relatively intact premorbid personality, and an underlying physical stratum.",

      "abstract": "Although uncommon, borderline personality disorder (BPD) may manifest for the first time later in life. A retrospective clinical file audit was used to identify the clinical manifestation of BPD for the first time at or above the age of 30, and to examine whether particular clinical and psychosocial factors may be associated with a later-in-life manifestation of BPD. Twenty-three cases of late manifestation BPD were identified. People with late manifestation of BPD had similar risk factors and vulnerabilities, including childhood trauma, to the broader BPD population. They were distinguished by having higher levels of education, employment, and long-term intimate relationships. Interpersonal problems, loss of employment and reminders of past sexual trauma were key precipitating factors. The findings underscore the legitimacy of a late-manifestation diagnosis of BPD by demonstrating that BPD does not present exclusively during adolescence and early adulthood. BPD may present for the first time in later life in response to loss of protective factors or triggering of past trauma. This understanding may reduce misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, prescription of inappropriate treatments or delays in receiving BPD-appropriate treatments.",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

This also has treatment implications in old age. Case presentation: A 65-year-old female who presented with mood and psychotic symptoms pose diagnostic dilemma. Careful history, collateral examination and continual exploration were done for accurate diagnosis and proper management. Due to overlapping symptoms, the initial diagnosis of psychotic depression was revised to paranoid schizophrenia. Eventually, the detailed examination, neurological and laboratory work up were done and the treatment approach was adjusted. The diagnostic dilemma appeared during the initial stage of the late onset psychosis due to affective symptoms. This case emphasises the critical role of clinical acumen in identifying the possibility of schizophrenia and other psychoses, ruling out organic aetiology and balancing the need of psychotropic drugs in old age.",

This may reflect a low prevalence rate or specific barriers to identification. Hypothesized barriers to clinical identification of emotional injury OCD include the atypically pleasant presentation of characteristic affirming compulsions. Patient self-identification is hypothesized to be diminished by the nature of overt and mental compulsions; for instance, agreeing with others and self-criticism. Recommendations are provided for differential diagnoses with social anxiety and codependency, as well as specific contraindications for common psychotherapeutic approaches. Hypothesized comorbid pathology are presented as opportunities for initial identification of cases. In establishing an a priori conceptual framework, this overlooked and misidentified OCD subtype can better be assessed, researched, and effectively treated.",

Certain information-processing deficits, autonomic reactivity anomalies, and social competence and coping limitations are viewed as potential vulnerability factors. Stressors in the form of discrete life events as well as the prevailing level of social environmental stress are seen as factors that interact with preexisting vulnerability characteristics to produce vicious circles, which lead, in turn, to psychotic episodes. A distinction among stable vulnerability indicators, mediating vulnerability factors, and episode indicators is suggested to differentiate types of abnormalities that characterize individuals prone to or manifesting schizophrenic disorder. Some major areas of unresolved questions in relation to this view of schizophrenic psychotic episodes are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Definite diagnosis of cerebral palsy is usually possible during the first six months of life in the hemiplegic child, but in the paraplegic or quadriplegic it may not be clear until the second half of the first year or later. Diagnosis should include not only type, degree and extent of motor handicap, but also intelligence, personality factors, sensory deficits, seizures and other physical problems. Diagnosis depends on detecting deviations from normal growth and development, of being aware of a multitude of progressive and other lesions which may simulate, at least early, the \"static\" group of conditions characterized by motor deficit due to central nervous system disease. Management involves early positioning, use of special equipment (mainly improvised), sensory stimulation and experience, as well as motor training, evaluation of intelligence and special learning situations to assist in discrimination learning and lengthening of attention span. Nursery schools for mentally capable children from 18 months to 3 years of age assist in developing independence, maturity and growth of personality. Except for patients with very severe mental or physical involvement, competitive employment in adult life is not related so much to the physical handicap as to personality characteristics, traits which are formed in early years.",

We also discuss psychological variables that help explain the vulnerability of bipolar patients to social environments, including personality factors (e.g., neuroticism), reward sensitivity, and difficulty with the accurate perception of facial emotions. Bipolar patients are highly sensitive to reward, and excessive goal pursuit after goal-attainment events may be one pathway to mania. Negative life events predict depressive symptoms, as do levels of familial expressed emotion. Psychosocial interventions can speed recoveries from episodes and delay recurrences over 1-2 year intervals. Future research should examine the nature of vulnerability/stress interactions at different phases of development, and the role of psychosocial interventions in altering these processes.",

Schizophrenia is a multidimensional disease characterized by\r\nheterogeneous symptoms. The psychotic symptoms are present in children and adolescents even\r\nbefore the diagnosis of the disease. The symptoms are divided into positive, negative and\r\ndisorganisation symptoms. The expression of symptoms in children differs from those in adults\r\ndue to the cognitive variation of different ages. The delay of the cognitive development is quite\r\noften in EOS. The cognitive impairment is a basic symptom of schizophrenia and it has an\r\ninfluence on the course and recovery. DSM-V define the criteria for the diagnosis: delusions,\r\nhallucinations, disorganized speech or behaviour, and negative symptoms. The indicators of a\r\nworse outcome are: worse cognition, male sex, earlier beginning, poor economic condition, long\r\nnon-treated period, previous lower social adjustment, and negative symptoms. The most common\r\ncomorbidity is drug abuse. The conditions considered for differential diagnosis are: general\r\nmedical conditions, other psychotic disorders, pervasive developmental disorder and autism.\r\nTherapy include: antipsychotics, psychoeducation and psychotherapy.

This condition has a subacute onset and can include symptoms of mood lability, decreased participation in activities of daily living, new-onset insomnia, social withdrawal, autistic-like regression, mutism, and catatonia. The acute phase is followed by a chronic phase in which baseline functioning may not return. No strict criteria or definitive testing is currently available to diagnose DSDD, although a comprehensive psychosocial and medical evaluation is warranted for individuals presenting with such symptoms. The etiology of DSDD is unknown, but in several hypotheses for regression in this population, psychological stress, primary psychiatric disease, and autoimmunity are proposed as potential causes of DSDD. Both psychiatric therapy and immunotherapies have been described as DSDD treatments, with both revealing potential benefit in limited cohorts.

High-risk and cohort studies demonstrate that children destined to develop schizophrenia tend to have delayed milestones and subtle neuromotor and cognitive impairments (particularly in coordination and language). These neurocognitive problems lead to difficulties in interpersonal relations, and their progressive alienation makes these at-risk children more likely to harbor odd or paranoid ideas. This cascade of increasingly deviant development may then be compounded by brain maturational changes during adolescence with a resultant lability of the dopaminergic response to stress. As a result, the individual is more susceptible to the effects of the abuse of dopamine-releasing drugs, and to other risk factors such as migration or stressful life events; social isolation may be a common pathway underlying several of the social risk factors.",

While neuroleptic medication may be useful during brief psychotic episodes (to which many patients with SP are prone), the mainstays of treatment are verbal psychotherapies. The chronicity of the condition calls for long-term therapy. An exploratory technique alone seldom suffices; therapy must also include supportive and social-reeducative measures.

My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "title": "Reactive attachment disorder as an evolutionary adaptation",
      "abstract": "This paper suggests that the behaviours associated with the formal diagnosis of the “disinhibited” form of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) might be seen as a functional adaptation rather than a mental health problem, a facultative response enhancing the probability of survival that is triggered by certain conditions. Although disinhibited RAD is most commonly observed in institutionalised children, similar behaviours may also be a part of the emotional difficulties displayed by some fostered and adopted children (the latter includes those once institutionalised), and these may demonstrate not so much a discrete attachment disorder as either the need to fend for oneself following loss of dedicated caregiving or a lack of opportunity to build specific intimate relationships with dedicated caregivers. In many cases this may be inextricably mixed with the neurobiological and psychological seqelae of maltreatment. Indiscriminate attachment behaviour, from this proposed evolutionary perspective, is less a syndrome of mental ill-health than an astute survival manoeuvre following being orphaned, abandoned or fecklessly reared. Such a response, allied to the innate facility to access caregiving from different adults, could be expected to be initiated by specific events as are the other attachment configurations. Classing disinhibited RAD as an adaptation has implications for helping children brought up under extreme duress when their caregiving environment has changed for the better.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are schizophrenia-like disorders which are not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia but which are sharing symptoms, causes and risk factors with schizophrenia. The concept emerges from the recognition that the clinical syndrome of schizophrenia is too restrictive to tap the whole variation of symptoms and features induced by causes underlying schizophrenia. The specific criterion for schizophrenia spectrum disorders is that they are aetiologically related to schizophrenia; and particularly that they are driven by the same familial–genetic factors. Along this line, two types of syndromes were proposed as components of the schizophrenic spectrum: (a) personality features and disorders – sometimes the spectrum concept is restricted to personality traits, and (b) psychotic symptoms and disorders, often with an episodic course, which are sharing clinical features with chronic schizophrenia without meeting the full diagnosis.",

Caso clínico: Paciente de 31 años sin antecedentes conocidos que debuta con un primer episodio psicótico, no enfermedades conocidas de interés. Consumo diario de cannabis sin especificar cuánto pero en incremento en los meses previos. Niega consumo de otras sustancias, no tiene ningún tratamiento pautado. Nula conciencia de enfermedad de la clínica psicótica ni del trastorno relacionado con el consumo, solicitando durante el ingreso que se le recete cannabis porque es la única medicina que le ayuda. Durante los dos años previos al ingreso se produce una situación de aislamiento progresivo, rompiendo los vínculos sociales y familiares, llegando a dejar de hablar incluso con los convivientes. Durante el ingreso en la unidad de hospitalización breve se realiza coordinación con profesionales de la unidad de conductas adictivas y del centro de rehabilitación psicosocial para un abordaje integral del caso. Conclusiones: En múltiples estudios se ha descrito la asociación entre la aparición de psicosis y el consumo de cannabis, describiéndose como factores que influyen en esta asociación la edad de inicio del consumo y la frecuencia. Así mismo, tanto la psicosis como el consumo de cannabis pueden influir de forma negativa sobre el funcionamiento psicosocial y laboral.

      "title": "CLINICAL STUDIES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "The scrutiny of this small group of patients, presenting a serious deterioration of insidious onset, reveals as outstanding factors the constitutional inadequacy of the individual patient and the unfavorable external factors which conditioned and frustrated him. Two of the patients developed pulmonary tuberculosis, but the clinical picture and course in these 2 patients were not markedly different from those of the other 7 patients. One may say that in this group the physical examination revealed no adequate cause for the onset of the deterioration. The clinical picture and course of the mental disorder in this group may be outlined as follows: The patient in adolescence or early adult life, without any adequate explanation in the way of physical illness or drastic change in the environment, begins to show a striking loss of sociability, initiative, interest and personal care. The course is as a rule steadily downwards, ending in a parasitic existence at a very low level. With the abeyance of the superior functions, with the loss of social response, of spontaneity, and of interest, there occur, perhaps as release phenomena, reactions of a lower neurological level—meaningless smiling and laughter, explosive outbursts of anger, occasional autoerotism, mannerisms and grimaces, automatic movements. Memory may be retained to a surprising extent; incoherence is frequently noted but the patient is uncommunicative. There is no special manifestation of basic urges, of underlying preoccupations, of repressed and dissociated factors. There seems to be a lack of vital energy associated with the egoistic as with the more complex social trends. The condition is one of defect rather than of conflict. In the comparative absence of tension, or turmoil, of compensatory strivings or phantasies, the clinical picture makes the impression of self-abandonment, of surrender, of acceptance of life at a lower automatic level. This surrender may be further evidence of the constitutional defect of vitality of the organism already indicated in childhood and made more manifest in face of the demands of the independent, mature, social life. The challenge of life to these underprivileged, poorly conditioned, and frustrated individuals is beyond their capacity. While others with somewhat different endowment react with hysterical or compulsive evasions, with affective slumps or sprees, with imaginative phantasies or regressive dramatisations, this group differently endowed reacts to the challenge with a simple surrender. If we continue to retain these patients within the hospitable group of schizophrenia, it may be legitimate to characterize their special type of reaction as schizophrenic \"surrender.\" In the further analysis of the conditions of this \"surrender\" the inadequacy or abiotrophy of component systems of the organism requires to be investigated and evaluated.",

      "title": "Correlation of Stigma with Self-compassion in Patients with Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background & Aims: The bipolar disorder is important mental disorder, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression.This chronic and complex disease affects the mood of the patient, causing continuous and abnormal mood changes from extremely good to extremely poor and depressed.These fluctuations often last for weeks or months.Frequent episodes of depression and mania affect the functioning of the individual in personal, professional, family, social, and cultural domains.Patients with the bipolar disorder experience a phenomenon known as stigma.Stigma is defined as a set of cognitions and behaviors that are activated by labeling, leading to social exclusion and isolation.The stigma of mental illness distinguishes the patients from other populations.The stigma of mental illness renders the patients incapacitated and socially isolated.In addition, the experience of stigma decreases the quality of life and health-seeking behaviors of the patients, threatening their socio-economic health.Subsequently, the social participation of patients with mental illness is disrupted, and they refrain from seeking social assistance.In fact, stigma leads to the rejection of patients with mental illness by the society, disrupting their emotional regulation and making them unable to have proper emotional regulation strategies.Furthermore, the stigma of mental illness causes the patients not to have appropriate coping strategies for the disease, hide their medical history from the medical staff, and avoid communicating with their friends after discharge from the hospital.Given the importance of the concept of stigma, identifying the positively correlated behaviors seems essential.Self-compassion is a positive behavior that may be associated with stigma.Individuals with high self-compassion are more likely to accept negative life events and have more accurate self-assessments and better mental health.Self-compassion is an important factor in the adaptive responses to the mood problems in patients with a history of recurrent depression.High self-compassion reduces the mental vulnerability of patients with mental illness to problems, their depression and social anxiety, shame caused by the illness, and selfcriticism.In contrast, the lack of self-compassion leads to self-judgment, a sense of further isolation, and a rush of negative emotions about oneself, which ultimately lead to the loss of intimacy in the relationships with others.Low self-compassion is present in a wide range of individuals with mental disorders and causes emotional distress, so that individuals with mental illness and low self-compassion are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.The present study aimed to assess the correlation between stigma and self-compassion in patients with the bipolar disorder.Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 200 patients with the bipolar disorder admitted to Iran Psychiatric Center in Tehran, Iran, who were selected via continuous sampling.Data were collected using a demographic data form and stigma and self-compassion tools.The demographic data form included data on age, gender, marital status, number of children, education level, occupation status, family history of mental disorders, number of family members, and number of admissions.The researcher evaluated the validity and reliability of the instruments.To determine validity, the instruments were provided to seven professors of the department of psychiatric nursing at Iran and",

The concept of psychic regression, initiated and driven by a motivation loss, requires a reassessment of the family links and of the patients-carers relationships. The relative part of conative depression, dysexecutive syndrome, and psychic regression is difficult to assess in old subjects on account of the complexity of the involved mechanisms (psychological aging, affective and relational history of the subject, family and environmental interactions). Lack of motivation and social dependency in old people result from a failure of the psychological mechanism of elaboration. We present a phenomenological point of view and advance some propositions for their prevention. Loss of motivation appears to be an acquired and dynamic process resulting from the psychological difficulties experienced by the individual due to the loss of autonomy and an increasing dependency which is not accepted although, paradoxically, searched for. This ambivalence results in loss of motivation and psychic regression which belongs to the non cognitive disorders of elderly people.",

First, the multidimensional assessment of suicidal risk defines the areas of interference with various axis I or axis II disorders, but also with the complex psychosocial environment of such patients. The therapeutic approach must be adapted by taking into account various factors (i.e. gender, age group, degree of social exclusion, etc.). Furthermore, case management must take into account the type of suicidal behavior (acute suicidal crisis or chronic suicidal state), this typology being dependent on the link with axis I disorders, more frequent in acute suicidal crisis, or with disorders belonging axis II, more common in chronic, repetitive suicidal behavior.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with psychopathy or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can behave in ways that suggest lack of empathy towards others. However, many different cognitive and affective processes may lead to unempathic behavior and the social processing profiles of individuals with high psychopathic vs. ASD traits are likely different. Whilst psychopathy appears characterized by problems with resonating with others' emotions, ASD appears characterized by problems with cognitive perspective-taking. In addition, alexithymia has previously been associated with both disorders, but the contribution of alexithymia needs further exploration. In a community sample (N = 110) we show for the first time that although affective resonance and cognitive perspective-taking are related, high psychopathic traits relate to problems with resonating with others' emotions, but not cognitive perspective taking. Conversely, high ASD traits relate to problems with cognitive perspective-taking but not resonating with others' emotions. Alexithymia was associated with problems with affective resonance independently of psychopathic traits, suggesting that different component processes (reduced tendency to feel what others feel and reduced ability to identify and describe feelings) comprise affective resonance. Alexithymia was not associated with the reduced cognitive perspective-taking in high ASD traits. Our data suggest that (1) elevated psychopathic and ASD traits are characterized by difficulties in different social information processing domains and (2) reduced affective resonance in individuals with elevated psychopathic traits and the reduced cognitive perspective taking in individuals with elevated ASD traits are not explained by co-occurring alexithymia. (3) Alexithymia is independently associated with reduced affective resonance. Consequently, our data point to different component processes within the construct of empathy that are suggestive of partially separable cognitive and neural systems.",

Cross-sectional studies have not supported the existence of a dichotomy between schizophrenia and affective disorders.

Longitudinal studies indicate that some patients with schizophrenia and major affective disorders go through a ‘schizo-affective period’ on the way to developing the clinical picture of the other disorder, while still other patients have a continuity of syndrome type. These findings suggest the importance of considering disorder processes rather than just disease types. An interactive developmental model of disorder is one way of conceptualizing these processes.",

To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease.

For various reasons, both the subjective and the cultural dimensions of these symptoms have been neglected or even denied.",

Nevertheless, there are indications for nosological differentiation of cycloid psychoses from other psychotic conditions. The case of cycloid psychosis of a 38 year old woman with two severe psychotic episodes of mixed, paranoid and affective symptomatology is described. Among the characteristic features of psychotic episodes were acute onset, severe but short course of the episodes and the lack of residual/defect symptoms at outcome. On the basis of this case the differential diagnosis of cycloid psychoses is discussed.",

The psychoanalytically expanded anamneses showed a distinct predominance of hysterical and depressive structures. With their friendly, open nature these patients appear cooperative and tension-free. They have problems when aggressive confrontations occur, especially with good acquaintances, from whom they expect recognition and friendly or loving attention. They try to earn these through a strong readiness to help, which often reaches a point of exhaustion. The causing situations appear especially characteristic: Before the disease started, most patients were able to sow their wild oats in all directions for a pretty long time. The disease breaks out when this lax style of living is given up, for the partner's sake, in a marriage or other firm kind of relationship. In their new life situation the patients cannot fully live their aggressive as well as their sexual needs in the accustomed way. A heightened muscular tension, as the physical correlate of this affective restraint, is postulated, which, as one of the factors, plays a role in the origin of morbus Bechterew.",

      "abstract": "Introductions: Loneliness is a subjective feeling that is described as a sense of isolation, a bad feeling about the quality and quantity of social relationships that has a major impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life. Social isolation is an important predictor of loneliness. Social isolation is often experienced by schizophrenia patients who experience alienation, social disconnection, limited access, and social support for their mental health. This study aimed to describe the relationship and its effect and factors related of loneliness and mental health, expecially in Scizophrenia patients. Methods: This study is a literature review that collects from various sources of scientific journals related to loneliness and its effect to Schizophrenia patients. Results: Lack of social interaction causes low or poor and vulnerable self-concepts experienced by schizophrenia patients, this is suspected of causing maladaptive cognition of oneself and others. Self-esteem that is seen as bad, hallucinations and delusions that are negative and self-critical reinforces negative self-concept. Schizophrenic sufferers tend to experience distortions related to self-confidence and their environment, they often think that they cannot be accepted by their environment and their environment rejects them. These increases feelings of loneliness and is thought to increase the incidence of psychotic symptoms. Conclusions: Social isolation and loneliness are important issues for schizophrenia patients because they can increase morbidity and mortality rates. Loneliness increases the incidence of auditory hallucinations with paranoid thinking, as well as negative beliefs about oneself and others in schizophrenia patients.

But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Patients with physical symptoms for which no medical explanation can be found are relatively common in general practice. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms are frequently frustrating to physicians both in primary and secondary care and utilize health sources disproportionately. They frequently attend both primary care units and hospitals and are usually not satisfied with the care they receive. Medically unexplained symptoms in patient populations are strongly associated with psychiatric pathology and with anxiety and depression in particular. They are also linked to personality pathology, childhood adversity, adult trauma or medically unexplained symptoms in childhood. The predictive value of alexithymia in determining these symptoms is controversial. Patients who have high negative affectivity or neuroticism tend to score high on measures of physical symptoms. These symptoms have a high degree of co-occurrence. The same person may meet the diagnostic criteria for several functional somatic syndromes simultaneously. The clinician should be aware of the cultural and social shaping of the bodily experience of these patients and hence acknowledge the somatic nature and reality of the symptoms. The clinician should make the person feel understood and establish a positive collaborative relationship. This would enable him/her to correct misconceptions about the disease and give a positive explanation of symptoms. Antidepressant therapy and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy have been proved to be moderately effective in this group of patients. Because of the high disability that might be caused by these symptoms, psychiatrists and primary and secondary care physicians should pay careful attention to this clinical condition. These symptoms may also aid us in challenging the long-held idea of mind-body dualism which is inherent in Western biomedicine.",

Schizophrenia falls under the larger umbrella of psychosis, from which, in general terms, the patient has difficulty telling the real apart from the imaginary. Differentiating schizophrenia from other forms of psychosis is the first step, as certain psychotic symptoms can lead to illnesses other than schizophrenia. A full psychiatric evaluation that assesses a patient’s physical and mental states, among others, is generally used to weed out the possibilities and identify the types of schizophrenia the patient is suffering from. Additionally, it is not unheard of for schizophrenia to develop earlier than the established baseline of adolescence to young adulthood, although there is added difficulty in diagnosing childhood-onset schizophrenia due to the possibility of a child’s still-growing body as being partly responsible for some of the symptoms involved.",

They may hear voices other people don’t hear. Schizophrenia symptoms contain three categories; Positive, Negative and Cognitive. There are different causes of Schizophrenia this may be due to Genes, Environment or Change in Brain Structures. Due to Schizophrenia the illness occurs in less than 1 percent of the general population, but this range becomes 10 percent who have first degree relatives with the disorder, such as parents, Brother or sister. Most people with schizophrenia are not violent; however, the risk of violence is greatest when schizophrenia is untreated. There are different molecular mechanisms of Schizophrenia i.e. Neurodevelopment Hypothesis, Dopamine hypothesis and Glutamate Hypothesis. It is important to help a person with schizophrenia symptoms get treatment as quickly as possible. Here Two main types of treatment can help with symptoms: antipsychotic medications and psychosocial treatments. Family and friends can help their loved ones with schizophrenia by helping them get treatment and encouraging them to stay in treatment.",

      "abstract": "People with, and those who are developing, schizophrenia are at increased risk to engage in aggressive behavior (AGB). Some incidents lead to criminal prosecution. Most people with schizophrenia who commit crimes engage in delinquency and/or AGB prior to first episode. A large proportion of these individuals have a history of childhood conduct disorder (CD) and brain abnormalities suggestive of abnormal neural development distinctive from that of others with schizophrenia. Factors contributing to schizophrenia that is preceded by CD include failing to learn not-to-behave aggressively in early childhood, impairments in understanding emotions in the faces of others, maltreatment, and subsequent re-victimization. Others with no history of antisocial behavior begin engaging in AGB as positive symptoms increase and illness onsets. They too are at elevated risk to be victimized. Specific genetic variants linked to stress regulation in combination with adversity have been associated both with AGB and psychotic symptoms. Effectively treating conduct problems and preventing victimization would reduce AGB by persons with schizophrenia.",

The research was based on a literature study. Databases searched included PsychINFO, Medline, Pub med, COCHRANE and PILOTS. Possible aetiological factors identified included: Children having a perfectionist, ambitious and conscientious premorbid personality, psychiatric problems of children and parents, and traumatic events. Symptoms between the two syndromes differed only in pattern of refusal and neurological symptoms. None of the differential diagnoses explored could account for all features. The individual impact of aetiological factors requires further investigation. Children might previously have been diagnosed with a number of differential diagnoses, though none of these accounts for all symptoms seen in the syndromes. Depressive Devitalization and Pervasive Refusal Syndrome are suggested to be subgroups of the same refusal syndrome.",

DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "A history of childhood adversities has been associated with the pathogenesis of several psychiatric conditions: major depressive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, alcohol/substance dependence, personality disorders [1]. It has therefore been suggested that childhood traumata might be a non-specific risk factor for psychopathology [2].This is in contrast to most psychological models, that postulated a certain specificity between the kind of childhood trauma, the attachment style and adult psychopathology [e.g. [3]].Few studies have dealt with this issue on empirical grounds. It has been reported that patients with a history of maltreatment exhibit greater severity, higher comorbidity, greater risk for suicide and poorer treatment response compared with non-maltreated patients with the same diagnoses [4].Emotional neglect during childhood was reported to be associated with depression, dysthymia and social phobia and with the anhedonic symptoms of depression, whereas sexual abuse in the past was associated with anxious arousal and general distress [5,6].As these findings are scant and not fully consistent, we decided to study the effects of early traumata on adult psychopathology, exploring the hypothesis that different adversities might be associated with different symptom patterns.Operational diagnoses, with their high rate of comorbidity and lack of specificity, might not be an adequate way to explore this topic. It is conceivable that different types of early adversities might produce symptom patterns that range transdiagnostically. Since to our knowledge no study has systematically explored this hypothesis, we assessed the relationship between early adversities (loss, neglect and abuse) and symptoms in a representative sample of psychiatric patients according to a transnosographic perspective.During the period November to December 2010 it was possible to contact and interview 409 consecutive patients admitted, within 1 week of the interview, to all the psychiatric in- and outpatient facilities of Tuscany. A group of 200 people randomly drawn from the general population living in the same catchment area and matched with the psychiatric cases for age, gender and education made up the controls.The adversities of childhood/adolescence were studied by the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA-Q [7]) and by an interview for early trauma widely used in the past [8]. For the purpose of this study early adversities were evaluated as follows: (a) presence of a loss event whenever a death or separation (for 1 year or more) from parents was reported; (b) presence of sexual abuse or physical abuse when the CECA-Q or the interview showed the occurrence of physical and/or sexual abuse; (c) the presence of neglect was based on the CECA-Q scores in the scales 'Mother's Neglect' and 'Father's Neglect' using the proposed cut-off [7].DSM-IV diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders [9]. The symptoms were assessed independently of the diagnoses: the items of several well-known rating scales, combined in a single fully validated instrument [8], were used.Compared with controls, patients as a whole showed an excess of all early life events (below statistical significance only in the case of loss; p value used <0.05). When the patients were divided according to their DSM-IV diagnoses (only diagnoses with at least 30 cases were considered), almost all the main diagnostic groups showed a significantly higher rate of abuse and neglect compared with the control group. An excess of loss events was generally reported, but the significance level was attained only by non-affective psychosis, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. When the diagnostic categories were compared with each other, no significant difference was found.The psychiatric symptoms of the patients who reported the occurrence of no adversity during childhood/early adolescence were compared with those of the cases who reported loss, neglect, sexual abuse or physical abuse. Of the 54 symptoms shown by at least 10% of cases, 17 bore significant associations with early adversities. Six maintained the significance (p < 0.001) after Bonferroni correction.Compared with patients with no early adversity, the patients reporting neglect were characterized by an excess of early awakening [odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = 1.86 (1.06-3.30)], hyporexia [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.13-3.70)], eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 2.87 (1.16-7.06)], suicidal ideation/attempts [OR (95% CI) = 1.83 (1.03-3.53)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 2.09 (1.17-3.74)] and sexual activity [OR (95% CI) = 1.91 (1.08-3.38)], mood-congruent delusions [OR (95% CI) = 2.61 (1.04-6.50)], and a previous history of hyperthymia [OR (95% CI) = 1.87 (1.03-3.38)].Sexual abuse was associated with night terror [OR (95% CI) = 2.46 (1.03-5.69)], recurrent nightmares [OR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.02-3.91)], intrusive memories [OR (95% CI) = 2.96 (1.05-8.34)] and flashbacks of the event [OR (95% CI) = 3.4 (1.16-9.92)], aggressive impulses [OR (95% CI) = 2.96 (1.51-5.82)], hyporexia [OR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.02-3.91)], binge eating [OR (95% CI) = 2.18 (1.07-4.42)], eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 3 (1.02-8)], suicidal ideation/attempts [OR (95% CI) = 2.04 (1.21-4.76)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 2.43 (1.22-4.83)], mood-congruent delusions [OR (95% CI) = 3.41 (1.03-8.96)], and a past history of substance abuse [OR (95% CI) = 3.02 (1.39-6.82)].Physical abuse bore significant associations with eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 3.09 (1.27-7.51)], recurrent nightmares [OR (95% CI) = 3.19 (1.11-9.14)], intrusive memories [OR (95% CI) = 2.63 (1.01-6.84)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 1.9 (1.07-3.67)] and a past history of substance abuse [OR (95% CI) = 2.25 (1.05-4.8)].Loss of parents was associated with a significantly increased risk of having weight loss [OR (95% CI) = 2.54 (1.37-4.59)] and grandiose thoughts [OR (95% CI) = 3.38 (1.54-7.42)].As the symptoms had some level of reciprocal association and the early life events also were not independent of each other, we adopted the stepwise forward conditional method of regression for controlling the multicollinearity. The adjusted ORs confirmed that each type of early adversity was associated with a specific symptom pattern (table 1).A huge number of previous studies already reported that early adversities differentiate psychiatric patients and controls, but failed to distinguish among specific DSM-IV diagnoses [1,2]. The well-known heterogeneity of DSM diagnoses and the high level of comorbidity can account for this. For this reason we chose the 'functional' approach proposed by Van Praag [10] and indeed in the present study early adversities seem to influence differentially specific symptom profiles rather than diagnoses.Retrospective recall may obviously bias the assessment of early adversities. However, the excess of even those early adversities that are reliably retrieved, such as death of parents, renders plausible that also the more subjective accounts retain a sufficient amount of credibility.The present study is one of the first yielding empirical evidence supporting the common psychotherapeutic position that different early adversities are associated with different adult clinical states. While these associations do not warrant a causal link, they suggest that the topic merits being studied from different perspectives rather than by adopting a purely nosological approach.",

      "title": "Putting the pieces together: The subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder",
      "abstract": "Throughout the history of psychology there is evidence of fragmentation, at multiple levels. As a result of this fragmentation knowledge of mental illness exists in the form of separate fragments or pieces, and the understanding of the subjective experience of a mental illness as a whole is often lost in the pieces. Such fragmentation is a concern as it has a significant impact on those suffering from a mental illness, as they may not feel understood, or aspects of their experience of mental illness may be missed or overlooked. Thus potentially reducing the individual's ability and willingness to approach and engage in treatment, reducing the possible efficacy of treatment and increasing the risk of relapse. The experience of not feeling understood, difficulties engaging in treatment and relapse are particularly common for individuals with anorexia nervosa, a disorder which has markedly been prey to the fragmentation in psychology. These experiences are concerning when one considers that anorexia nervosa is a chronic disorder, associated with severe physical and psychological consequences, including death, due to physical complications or suicide. The impact of the disorder stems beyond the individual, with families and care-givers also experiencing high levels of distress. Due to the risk, severity and chronic nature of anorexia nervosa, it is important that understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa is increased to foster research, development and implementation of efficacious interventions. These concerns led to the research question guiding this research: what is the human subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder? The purpose of a broad research question was to maximize the pieces of experience gathered, as well as establish the context of experiences, and thereby gathering a picture of the subjective experience of the disorder in its complexity.;As a vast array of, albeit fragmented, knowledge exists on anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, theories and hypotheses from the literature were used as points of triangulation. In order to capture the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa qualitative methodology was used, and 15 self defined recovered sufferers of anorexia nervosa were interviewed. During the interview, participants were asked to describe their experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, as well as comment on the perceived relevance of theory and hypotheses (or pieces of knowledge) from four different orientations (biological, social-cognitive, family and existential) that exist in the field. Data analysis involved gathering pieces from theory and participant experience, organizing these pieces, and working up from the data to establish a picture of an individual's experience at the different stages of the disorder, and how this changes over time. As the research was exploring both what is the subjective experience, and how it changes over time, data analysis was guided by both phenomenological and grounded theory methodology. An adapted form of Heidegger's (1962) worlds of being was also used, to assist organization of pieces, based on where the experience was in relation to the individual. From this analysis a Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, as well as phases of maintenance and recovery, were developed that meaningfully tie together pieces of experience, to capture the complex subjective experience of anorexia nervosa at different stages, and how an individual moves through the stages. The Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases increase the understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa, and have the capacity to assist research, development and implementation of efficacious treatment.;The development of the Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases, also acts as a small step towards resolving the issue of fragmentation, and recapturing the subjective experience of mental illness.",

      "abstract": "Hyperactivity is a symptom that may occur in a number of childhood disorders. Because it may be an extreme form of a normal variant of activity level in normal children, the presence of excessive activity is not diagnostic in itself. The disorder, now called Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADDH), is also defined by exclusion. The diagnosis is reserved for children who are not markedly deficient in social and cognitive development; hence, they do not suffer from a schizophrenic or other psychotic disorder. Mood regulation is not grossly impaired, so that mania is thereby ruled out. This point is important because the concept of childhood hyperactivity used by many divergent groups such as parent organizations or educational institutions probably encompasses a broader range of pathology than the term implies when used by specialists in the field of study for the disorder. This discussion does not apply to hyperactive children with brain damage, mental retardation, seizure disorders or other neurological disorders, but to youngsters without known central nervous system disorders whose intellectual development is within the average range. As the name implies, hyperactive children display, for their age, high levels of motor activity. In addition, they also suffer from attentional deficits and impulsive behavior. However, a picture of a child in constant motion is errone",

The preoccupation is associated with many time consuming rituals such as mirror gazing or constant comparing. BDD patients have a distorted body image, which may be associated with bullying or abuse during childhood or adolescence. Such patients have a poor quality of life, are socially isolated, depressed, and at high risk of committing suicide. They often have needless dermatological treatment and cosmetic surgery. The condition is easily trivialised and stigmatised.

The former commonly used conception of the disease, hebephrenia, as a pubertal form of schizophrenia has largely lost its significance.

The particular importance of this disease lies in the individual experience of this disturbance of the reference environment which is an existential threat to a newly formed personality and its relation to the environment. The difficulty in classifying it among the psychoses on the one hand and as a neurosis on the other has produced a term \"borderline\" for it, characterized by an infantile incompatibility with positive and negative tendencies in himself and in reference persons and through the lack of a stable reality of reference.",

Personality, cognitive functions, α 2 and imidazoline binding, sensitivity to inducement of panic attacks, relative hypothyroidism, and some but not all serotonergic functions of women with dysphoric PMS differ from those with no PMS, and also differ during a non‐symptomatic phase of the cycle. It is suggested that premenstrual symptoms are an expression of vulnerability traits that might surface in response to a trigger. Such traits are probably diverse, and the nature of the symptoms might depend upon the underlying trait.

      "abstract": "This review focuses on the differentiation of schizophrenia in the setting of adult psychiatry from neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD's) and psychosis due to other medical conditions (PDMC). Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "abstract": "Very few pediatric cases with focal frontal lesions have been documented psychia‐trically. Orbitofrontal lesions in adults produce a pseudopsychopathic personality syndrome with impulsivity, and dorsolateral and frontomedial lesions produce a pseudodepressive personality syndrome with mental inertia. A frontal profile similar to character disorder several times has been reported in children with frontal lesions, but pseudodepression never has been reported. SC2, a 7‐year‐old girl, had a left‐frontal cavernous hemangioma partially surgically removed at age 3. Low academic achievement and concern about lack of communicativeness and initiative motivated referral. She is a strong prototype of the pseudodepressive‐inert type, but she is not at all a prototype of the pseudopsychopathic‐impulsive type, thus being the first reported pediatric focal frontal lobe lesion case displaying this particular profile. SC2 is a quiet, aloof, amorphous, trouble‐free schoolchild. She is impaired in a wide range of cognitive (executive) functions on many of the cognitive tests administered; and she requires excessive motivational and cognitive support to complete tests such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (3rd ed.), the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and others. All her deficits can, however, be tagged to one or another form of inertia, but never to impulsivity. On tests, she is perseverative, lacks initiative and strategy, and is slow and concrete when creative or sustained processing are required by the task. She shows no sign of depressed mood according to the Achenbach Depression subscale and numerous observations from various other sources. In short, there are 2 highly distinct syndromes of personality and cognition that result from focal frontal lobe lesions in the child, just as in the adult.",

Delusional thinking may occur in severe cases. Behaviourally, depression reflects helplessness or appeasement that arise from feelings of inferiority, entrapment, or defeat. Non-verbal behaviour in depression resembles ancient strategies of vertebrates to signal submission. At the cognitive level, people with depression often engage in ruminating thoughts, often involving self-derogation or worthlessness. Depression may occur in situations when one’s social status is threatened or an actual fall in rank has taken place. This is often accompanied by a reduction of serotonin availability. Genes conferring risk for depression when coupled with adverse early experiences may even protect against depression when associated with supportive parenting, suggesting genetic plasticity. Aside from ethological considerations, depression may also be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system.",

The aim is to refute the hypothesis of the need to identify this clinical condition in a new descriptive framework. Materials and methods: Pubmed checklist, clinical interview, and psychometric tests. Results: In the entirety of the selected population, it emerges that the primary disorder is schizoid personality disorder; this is followed by depressive disorder, narcissistic covert disorder, bipolar disorder with depressive prevalence, obsessive disorder, avoidant disorder, and somatic disorder as secondary dysfunctional personality traits. Childhood and/or family trauma, capable of impacting the sexual and affective sphere, is present in almost the entire population. Conclusion: The syndrome should be framed as a specific phenomenon and not as a new psychopathological disorder, as the symptomatological descriptions are similar to the already known schizoid personality disorder; the symptomatological differences among patients should be framed according to a logic of correctives determined by the presence of one or more secondary psychopathological traits that draw a more complex personality picture than the simple nosographic diagnosis of the DSM-V.",

This is an attitude that they unfortunately share with most nonalcoholics; therefore some tact is required in referring them for treatment. If the alcoholic demonstrates abnormal behavior, appears depressed, or evidences a disturbance in his thinking (most frequently, ill-founded or illogical suspicions or grandiose opinions), he should certainly be examined psychiatrically, since in such cases the drinking may only be symptomatic of a severe underlying mental disturbance.

This may be so severe as to necessitate complete custodial care indefinitely; it may be so slight, that a simple change in environment or program may allow for relatively normal community activity with minimal to no supervision. For these different degrees of disability a wide variety of terms have been used. In decreasing order of disability, the terms most frequently employed including their definitions in terms of intelligence quotients are as follows: 1. Borderline: I.Q. 70-80 2. Moron or high grade: I.Q. 50-70 3. Imbecile or middle grade: I.Q. 20-49 4. Idiot or low grade: I.Q. 0-19 Such terms as feeblemindedness and mental retardation are generally used interchangeably for mental deficiency. Obviously, not all children failing to adjust socially or follow normal paths of development are so because of basic mental deficiency. Certain other conditions, either superficially or strikingly resembling mental deficiency states, must be differentiated. These latter conditions require a different and sometimes highly specialized therapeutic approach and any considerable delay in their recognition may adversely affect subsequent adjustment. The most common of these conditions include the following which are briefly described: 1. Delay in Educational Maturation: There is considerable variation in the time at which children of normal intellectual capacity reach the stage at which they properly react to the usual educational procedures, normally introduced at about 6 years of age. This so-called period of \"educational readiness\", for want of a better term, includes many aspects such as attention span, personal relations and socialization status, and may occasionally be delayed 2 or 3 years.",

      "abstract": "The developmental-structuralist approach to psychopathology in infants and young children involves studying adaptive and maladaptive patterns at each level of \"experimental organization\" from the early sensory, motor, and affective-thematic organizations to the later representational ones. Psychopathology may be related to defects or constrictions at each organizational level, including the representational or symbolic realm, without underlying vulnerabilities in earlier levels of organization, and may also involve the presumed \"underbelly\" of the personality, those central nervous system organizations that have to do with filtering and processing of perceptions and experience (the early sensory and affective-thematic organizations). The most severe psychopathologies, it will be suggested, occur where there are compromises in both the early sensory and affective-thematic and later representational organizations. Early limitations in \"processing\" animate or inanimate experiences may, in many instances, be highly specific and reversible rather than global. The early detection of sensory and affective-thematic organizational compromises, followed by approaches that facilitate phase-specific \"essential experiences\" through intact sensory pathways and the remediation of compromised ones, may provide a systematic base for possible preventive intervention approaches.",

Most commonly a primary case can be distinguished from other one or more cases, in whom the symptoms are induced. the patients implied in the shared delusional symptoms are frequently linked by close relationship bonds, mostly family ties. Its epidemiology remains unclear, because very few data is available. There are some requirements concerning the persons involved for the development of this disorder: 1. Close coexistence and intimate emotional links between the two people are observed; 2. The delusional content is plausible and can be based on past events or expectations; 3. Typically, the induced individual has an easily influenciable personality. Case report: We describe and comment one case of shared paranoid disorder between a 29 year old schizophrenic patient and her 43 years old sister. both share a persecution and prejudice delusion involving the Chinese community of their hometown. after a few days of inward treatment at separated psychiatric wards, the delusional symptoms in the older sister started to improve. Conclusion: Our intention is making a review on a diagnosis that remains controversial nowadays. Treatment should begin with the separation of the induced and the inducer. Anyhow, a psychopharmacological treatment is required in both individuals. It seems clear, however, that the prognosis of the induced and the inducer is different, according to a variety of factors.",

      "title": "Social Cognition, Executive Dysfunction and Neuro-Behavioral Karate: Alternative Medicine or Psychomotor Treatment?",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSocial cognitive disorders include a number of clinical conditions that become apparent in early or middle childhood and are characterized primarily by objective and, in time, subjective difficulties pertaining to the interpersonal world of those affected. On the grounds of current knowledge of the social brain, in the context of a project named From the Dojo to the Family to Society (1) and in light of the sophisticated neuropsychology underlying the practice of traditionally taught karate, a program was developed to include children with disruptive behaviours and social cognitive disorders in the ordinary dojo, the practice hall for Japanese martial arts. The targeted disorders ranged from ADHD (attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder) to conditions falling under the rubric of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (2,3). Of note is that ADHD and ASD share certain characteristics and affected children share clinical vulnerabilities (4). In addition, a vast number of children are marginalized because of extreme social clumsiness, appearing odd, eccentric and different from their typically developing peers, but not meeting current official criteria for either disorder. Turning short-term working memory for behaviours and self-regulation into automatic procedural knowledge lies at the heart of karate's potential effectiveness as an intervention for behaviour problems.Social cognitionSocial cognition can be narrowly defined as the capacity to understand social situations and to act accordingly (5). It relies a number of neural structures and skills, including executive functions, the capacity for emotional expression and decoding across sensory modalities, which include facial, speech and gestural components, and attentional skills to direct our sensory systems in decoding the communicative signals from others. To a significant extent, social cognition also involves our own self-perception and an intact body awareness. A key element in social cognition and social development is joint attention. This implies both a response to others (RJA or responding to joint attention) through following others' gaze or gestures, as well as initiating joint attention (IJA) through one's own gestural behaviours. Initiating joint attention also requires moving one's own gaze back and forth between an object and the other observer, to signify that we are both looking at the same thing, thereby signalling a shared process (6). Attention is a curious phenomenon. It is still unclear if, from a neuroanatomical perspective, a single, unitary system underlies attention. Probably given the complexity of brain, the mechanisms underlying attention likely occur at multiple cortical levels (7).The social brain includes structures that are key for both our understanding of the world and for modifying our behaviours in response to situations (8). It can be simplistically divided into anterior and posterior components, viewed as executors and decoders, respectively, the basis of the specific functions of underlying brain. Likewise, a right versus left division of brain systems signifies the natural asymmetry that exists, both a sensory-motor level, and in the specialization of specific anatomical portions, where the right hemisphere may be responsible for body awareness, gestalt and visualization processes, and the left largely for language functions. Both systems, antero-posterior and left-right, include areas located in the cortex of the brain and in deeper subcortical structures. The systems are in a constant state of communication, with information being passed on back and forth and left and right (9).Executive functions are a fundamental set of skills that include, among others, the capacity to modify our own behaviour, to interrupt a thought or action, to self-monitor and -regulate, to choose among conflicting choices, and to direct our attention (10). Executive skills are subserved by an interrelated set of systems that include structures within the frontal lobe, various sensory systems and the cerebellum. …",

The differential diagnosis includes other psychiatric and pervasive developmental disorders, deafness, and profound hearing loss.

Common comorbidities include mental retardation, seizure disorder, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety.

The individual who initially experiences these delusional thoughts is referred to as the primary case, while the subsequent transmission of these beliefs to another person designates them as the secondary case. Typically, this phenomenon arises within close interpersonal relationships, such as familial or intimate partnerships. The primary case is typically diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, while the secondary case, lacking any previous psychiatric history, develops similar delusions as a consequence of close contact with the primary case. It is important to note that the specific shared delusional beliefs can exhibit considerable variability, contingent upon the nature of the primary case's delusions and their influence on the secondary case. Common types of shared delusions encompass persecutory, grandiose, erotomanic, somatic, jealous, and religious misbeliefs.

      "abstract": "The early detection of the schizophrenia prodrome in young people considered ‘at-risk‘ of developing this severe mental illness has entered mainstream clinical practice despite the limitations in the predictive specificity of the clinical criteria that define the At-Risk Mental State syndrome. These limitations are increasingly addressed by brain imaging research, which has added substantial evidence to the notion of emerging and progressive gray and white matter abnormalities in the early phase of illness. The association of the apparent neuropathology with the clinical signs and symptoms of the disorder – along with cognitive impairment and the underlying pathophysiology – will be reviewed.\r\n\r\nBorderline personality disorder is a mental health condition that affects how you think and feel about yourself and others, leading to difficulties in daily living. It includes challenges with self-esteem, trouble controlling emotions and conduct, and a history of shaky relationships. BPD is a significant mental illness marked by extreme mood swings and relationship difficulties. BPD patients experience intense emotions, and bouts of rage, anxiety, or melancholy might last for days.",

      "abstract": "Humans are social animals attuned to reactions of others; however, some are exquisitely sensitive to--and often misperceive--perceptions of those they encounter. The core feature of social phobia is marked and persistent fear of embarrassment or humiliation in social situations where the individual worries that others may judge his or her performance as too much or too little. Anticipatory anxiety and avoidance occur when the individual is under scrutiny while speaking or performing publicly, eating with others, writing in public, or using public bathrooms. Diagnosis of social phobia is based largely on history obtained from the patient. Onset is usually around puberty; its course is chronic with comorbid depression common and alcohol and other substances routinely abused in misguided attempts to minimize anxiety and depressive symptoms. At examination, patients often have a moist hand, averted gaze, blushing, and other manifest signs of anxiety. Slight shyness is familiar to most, but a substantial number suffer dysfunctional and distressing social anxiety to the point that they become phobic. A few patients satisfy criteria for avoidant personality disorder, which can be socially incapacitating.",

Schizophrenia tends to develop in early adulthood and has a major impact on all aspects of functioning, including work, school, social relationships, and self-care. The illness is thought to have a biological basis that interacts with environmental and psychological factors, including stress, social support, and social competence and coping skills. Schizophrenia was once thought to be a progressively deteriorating disorder. However, more recent perspectives on schizophrenia focus on helping people define the meaning of recovery for themselves, to set personally meaningful goals, and to become active participants in their own treatment. A broad range of effective treatments exist for schizophrenia, including antipsychotic medications and psychosocial interventions such as supported employment, family psychoeducation, social skills training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis. Although most people with schizophrenia experience some symptoms and impairments throughout their lives, recent treatment advances enable them to live rewarding, fulfilling lives, and to make a contribution to society.",

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

When non-affective psychotic symptoms emerge for the first time in later life, the clinical presentation has both similarities and differences with earlier-onset syndromes. This situation has resulted in continuing debate about the nosological status of late-onset psychosis, and whether there are particular risk factors associated with this late-life peak in incidence. Although early cognitive decline is frequently identified in these patients, studies, to date, have not established if there is a relationship with the dementing illnesses of old age. Sensory impairment, social isolation, and a family history of schizophrenia have been associated with late-onset psychosis, but appear to exert a nonspecific influence on vulnerability. While diagnostic issues remain unresolved, clinicians need to formulate treatment strategies that most appropriately address the constellation of symptoms in the clinical presentation of their psychotic elderly patients.",

The typical course of a psychogenic epidemic at a workplace progresses from sudden onset, often with dramatic symptoms, to a rapidly attained peak that draws much publicity and is followed by quick disappearance of the symptoms. Over 90% of the affected persons are women, and the symptoms range from dizziness, vomiting, nausea, and fainting to epileptic-type seizures, hyperventilation, and skin disorders. The background mechanisms are thought to be generalized beliefs and triggering events which create a sense of threat that leads to a physiological state of arousal. This state, in turn, creates new beliefs which give meaning to the sense of arousal. The new belief spreads through sociometric channels. Predisposing factors include boredom, pressure to produce, physical stressors, poor labor-management relations, and impaired interpersonal communications, and lack of social support. It is important that a thorough investigation be carried out in all instances. Investigation is not only necessary for diagnosis, but it also reassures the management, the employees, and the press that physical factors are unlikely to be responsible for the disease.",

      "abstract": "This article uses a version of the vulnerability-stress model to examine psychosocial factors related to the onset, course, and treatment of schizophrenia. High-risk studies, most of which study offspring of a schizophrenic parent, suggest that signs of vulnerability to the disorder may emerge in early to middle childhood in neuromotor integration, attentional and information-processing abilities, and deviant social behavior. It is still not clear that these markers are specific to the subsequent development of schizophrenia. The evidence for stressful family relationships as potentiators of the disorder in vulnerable offspring is also reviewed. Although few studies are available that bear directly on this issue, the preliminary evidence suggests that further investigation is warranted. Stressors, particularly those arising from within the family, are also examined as they relate to the course of schizophrenia. The data on expressed emotion (EE) have been replicated more often than not, although the origins of high EE attitudes are not precisely understood. These attitudes do not arise as reactions to the form or severity of a relative's disorder, but they may relate to the length of time between initial onset of the disorder and first hospitalization. Family-based intervention programs, overlaid on regular antipsychotic drug treatment, appear to reduce the risk for relapse in the short-term. At least one of the mechanisms of action of these programs is to reduce the negative affective climate in the family.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is an impossible concept. Under this heading, a number of psychoses is being grouped which have the common characteristic that the patient is, as a rule, but by no means always, fully conscious. In all other respects, no other points agree, neither in respect of symptoms, nor in respect of etiology or prognosis. Hence, there are hardly any reasons to reduce these disease patterns to a common denominator, either as \"schizophrenia\" or as a \"group of schizophrenic psychoses\". Rather, it seems more probable that schizophrenic psychoses are individual disease patterns, instead of being variations of a basic type. What is principally needed at this stage, is a fair amount of empirical research to catalog the concept of schizophrenia. Such a catalog would have to be based on exactly defined and described syndromes to enable further study whether there are any other points besides these symptoms which characterize the syndrome in question, such as etiology, pathogenetic factors, course, or response treatment. The more characteristics are found, the greater the chance that the disease pattern under investigation is really a unit by itself. In the course of these studies, and in order to avoid terminological confusion, it is advisable to use, for the time being, the term \"schizophrenic psychoses\", under the condition that in each concrete case this term must be supplemented by a careful typification of the symptomatology, of the etiologic factors, and of the course of the disease.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

      "abstract": "During episodes of depression, patients exhibit a low mood and a number of other emotional and/or physical symptoms for a certain period of time. Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "abstract": "The study of premorbid personality in functional (i.e., “nonorganic”) mental disorders may serve as a basis for the study of personality disorders. The latter can be considered as maladapted extreme variants of the types or dimensions of personality found either premorbidly in psychiatric patients or in healthy probands. Retrospective as well as prospective studies indicate that schizotypal traits are seldom found in the premorbid development of schizophrenics. Apparently, they are relatively nonspecific symptoms of the initial stage or of a subclinical form of the psychosis. The same seems to apply to cyclothymic traits in affective disorders. On the other hand, hyperthymic traits can often be ascertained premorbidly in bipolar patients with a preponderance of mania in the long run. These findings should be taken into account when constructing diagnostic schemata of Axis I and Axis II disorders, such as DSM-IV.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. There must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months, although the duration may be shortened with appropriate treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medications. Adjunctive psychological and social interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "title": "Burden of Care and Parent-Child Relationship of Parents of Autistic Children",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAll parents wish for a healthy baby, but some parents though not by their choice are gifted with a special child, like a child with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Mentally Retarded (MR), Down Syndrome and so on. Some Parents are able to cope up with such a situation whereas, other experience psychological problems (Peshwaria, R. A. and Ganguti, R. et al., 1995). Many parents experience periods of disbelief, deep sadness and depression and self-blame and guilt whereas others experience helplessness, feelings of inadequacy, anger, shock and guilt (Gupta and Singhal 2005).According to the DSM-IV, child autism is defined as a pervasive developmental disorder having the following main characteristics: (a) qualitative impairment in social interaction; (b) qualitative impairment in communication; (c) restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities; (d) delays in at least one of the following three areas: social interaction, language as used in social communication, symbolic or imaginative play. The Key building blocks for social relationships (i.e., communication, social understanding, and emotional responsiveness) are impaired in individuals with autism (Travis and Sigman, 1998).The birth of an autistic child adds situational crisis, one that results from an unanticipated, traumatic event beyond parental control. When parents become aware of their child's disorder they are inevitably shocked and painfully surprised that they must suddenly adjust to the new role as the parents of an exceptional child and they must adjust their self-image to cope with new responsibilities and functions (Gregory, 1991). The presence of a child with developmental disability in the family calls for a lot of adjustment on the parents and other family members (Peshawaria R, Venkatesan S. 1992)Review of literature revealed that the presence of a child with a disability or illness is stressful for parents especially mothers but most of the studies are done outside India. Studies pertaining to burden of care and parent child relationship of parents of autistic and normal children are almost nil. In view of this, the present study is taken up with the main objective of doing a comparative study between the parents having an autistic child and those with a normal child, evaluating their quality of life, burden of care and the parent-child relationship.HypothesesProposed hypotheses of the study areHa1. The parents of *autistic children and parents of **normal children differ significantly on Burden of care.Ha2. The parents of *autistic children and parents of **normal children differ significantly with respect to parent - child relationship.METHODParticipantsThe sample for the present study includes 107 parents of autistic children (57 mothers and 50 fathers) and 118 parents of normal children (67 mothers and 51 fathers). The age group of the sample is between 30 - 45 years. The sample for this study was delimited to accessible, biological mothers and fathers of children from Pune and Mumbai city of Maharashtra, diagnosed with ASD four and above years of age or under by a qualified health care provider. The mother/father of the diagnosed child had to live with, provide care for and raise the child. To reduce measurement error, the sample was delimited to mothers who read as well as understand English/Marathi or both. The diagnosis of the child was within two year of this study and done by a valid and reliable screening tool or multi-professional team during the preschool-age years.MATERIALS AND PROCEDURE1. Burden Assessment Schedule (Thara et al., 1998). BAS is a most frequently used tool to asses the burden of care of psychiatric patients in India. It measures burden in nine areas: (a) Spouse related (b) Physical and mental health (c) External support (d) Care-giver's routine (e) Support of patient (f) Taking responsibility (g) Other relations (h) Patients' behaviour (i) care-givers' strategy. …",

A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered.

Two self-disorders are described: decreased self-affection (reduced sense of ownership of experiences, reduced sense of authorship of actions) and hyperreflexivity (normally self-evident experiences receive disproportionate attention). Self-disorders are common in schizophrenia, but also in other psychiatric classifications. Partly due to the emphasis on reliability of DSM-5 classifications, there is limited interest in the self-disorders. Treatment focused on physical and social activity can probably enhance the basic sense of self. In addition, hyperreflexivity may be reduced by interventions aimed at acceptance, while targeting so-called erroneous cognitions may possibly worsen hyperreflexivity.Self-disorders in schizophrenia are common and insufficient attention is paid to self-disorders in research and clinical practice. More knowledge about self-disorders might lead to new insights into therapeutic options in schizophrenia.",

However, social science and social psychology in particular fall short in the analysis of autistic behavior, the real-life manifestations of the disorder. In this address, I suggest that unless we tackle behavior in interaction, rather than as emanating from individuals, we cannot analytically comprehend behavior as a socially real and holistic entity. The particular phenomena under investigation is transpositioning, or how a neurotypical (NT) professional initiates a sequence of action (first position) involving a recipient who has ASD. Then, the person with ASD fashions a response (second position) that is resistive or noncooperative. However, the NT professional subsequently fashions an action that portrays the ASD person’s second position or responsive behavior as an initiation or feature independent of what may have prompted it. Moreover, in reporting on the event in police, clinical, or other records, there is an elision of the prior initiations or first position actions such that the person with ASD is shown to have manifested ostensibly autonomous and anomalous behavior requiring interventions or remediation.",

Positive symptoms should then be considered psychologic pathology - that is, symptoms developed “de novo” as unique manifestations of the illness itself. A three-step model for the development of negative symptoms has been suggested: the first step is anhedonia, which is a loss of hedonia, such as lack of empathy or lack of drive. The second step is the lack of spontaneous, communicative language leading to symptoms like “conceptual disorganization”. The third step in the negative process is the deterioration into dementia. It is argued that quality of life scales for schizophrenia focus mainly on the social consequences of negative symptoms.□ Anhedonia, Negative process of schizophrenia, Psychopathologic theories, Quality of life.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Suicide and suicide attempts occur at a significantly greater rate in schizophrenia than in the general population. Common estimates are that 10% of people with schizophrenia will eventually have a completed suicide, and that attempts are made at two to five times that rate. Demographically associated with suicidality in schizophrenia are being young, being early in the course of the illness, being male, coming from a high socioeconomic family background, having high intelligence, having high expectations, not being married, lacking social supports, having awareness of symptoms, and being recently discharged from the hospital. Also associated are reduced self-esteem, stigma, recent loss or stress, hopelessness, isolation, treatment non-compliance and substance abuse. Clinically, the most common correlates of suicidality in schizophrenia are depressive symptoms and the depressive syndrome, although severe psychotic and panic-like symptoms may contribute as well. This review specifically explores the issue of depression in schizophrenia, in relation to suicide, by organizing the differential diagnosis of this state and highlighting their potentially treatable or correctable causes. This differential diagnosis includes both acute and chronic disappointment reactions, the prodrome of an acute psychotic episode, neuroleptic induced akinesia and akathisia, the possibility of direct neuroleptic-induced depression, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and the possible co-occurrence of an independent depressive diathesis. The potential beneficial roles of 'atypical' antipsychotic agents, including both clozapine and more novel agents, and adjunctive treatment with other psychopharmacological medications are considered, and the important roles of psychosocial factors and interventions are recognized.",

      "title": "The Neurobiology of Affiliation: Implications for Autism",
      "abstract": "Abstract A decade from now, when we look back at the early years of affective neuroscience, we may wonder about our conspicuous preoccupation with “negative” emotions. Fear and anxiety, sadness and depression, anger and aggression have received considerable attention in the past few years. By contrast, the neurobiology of “positive” affects, such as joy, affiliation, and love, seem almost taboo subjects. No doubt our focus on negative emotions derives from a need to understand psychopathological states. Most major forms of psychopathology, such as the anxiety and affective disorders, involve an excess of one of the negative emotions. Recently, we have begun to appreciate that most mental disorders also involve a loss of positive affect, whether it is the anhedonia of major depressive disorder, the absence of affiliation in autism, or the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. An important first step toward accounting for the loss of positive affects will be to understand their normal expression. Clearly, joy is not just the absence of sadness, and love/affiliation is much more than the absence of hate or fear. Positive affects will undoubtedly have a circuitry and a neurochemistry that is unique from what we have already learned about fear, sadness, and anger. But how can we study these complex affects with the modern tools of neurobiology? In this chapter, I review one approach based on animal studies. This approach demonstrates that current molecular and cellular tools, when combined with comparative, ethologically relevant studies, can reveal some intriguing leads into the neural basis of affiliation in nonhuman animals. Affiliation is an ethological term generally used to describe membership in a conspecific group. In fact, there are two quite different uses of the term affiliation. The first, relevant to all species, is sociality. Some highly affiliative species, including our own, cluster in flocks or herds in which group membership is essential for survival. Other, nonaffiliative species, such as orangutans or certain cats, are loners, living solitary lives except when mating or caring for young. A second use of the term affiliation describes specific aspects of behavior within a species. In this latter sense, affiliative behaviors include side-by-side or huddling behavior, parent-infant attachment, and pair bonding. Because these behaviors are most relevant to understanding the basis of the powerful human experiences of acceptance, attachment, and love, this chapter focuses on this second meaning of affiliation.",

Nearly 60% of the schizophrenics studied had suffered a depressive syndrome during the course of their schizophrenic illness, supporting the observations of others. The majority of patients with a history of depression who were otherwise diagnosable as schizophrenic had a course of illness consistent with schizophrenia during follow-up. The pattern of illness among first-degree relatives suggested that intercurrent depression did not represent a biologic unity with primary affective disorder. Intercurrent depression should not be overinterpreted in excluding a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

This report suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity in the long-term outcome of schizophrenia, with marginal or deteriorated states more the exception than the rule.

      "abstract": "WHAT IS AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER?'Autism', derived from the Greek word 'autos', or 'self', refers to someone who 'lives in a world of his own'.Hence, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects a person's ability to make sense of the world and relate to other people.It is characterised by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests.These manifest during the early developmental period and cause clinically significant impairment of social and occupational function (Box 1). (1) The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fifth Edition, refers to ASD as a single condition with different levels of severity, collectively representing four subtypes that were previously defined in DSM-IV (autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified). (1) ASD is also associated with psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety, aggression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder. (2)he exact aetiology of ASD is unknown; it is thought to have strong and complex genetic underpinnings with modulation of phenotypic expression by environmental factors. (3)Normal childhood vaccines have been falsely implicated in the causation of ASD, and extensive research has now proven no link between vaccination and ASD. (4)Factors associated with increased risk of ASD include: (5) male gender; family history of sibling or parent with ASD; advanced paternal and maternal age; prematurity (gestational age < 35 weeks) or antenatal infections; antenatal exposure to medications (e.g.valproate and antidepressants); and genetic syndromes such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, muscular dystrophy and neurofibromatosis.ASD is not uncommon.Based on local data from KK Women's and Children's Hospital and National University Hospital, the prevalence of ASD in Singapore is estimated to be one in 100 individuals, and most children are formally diagnosed at approximately three years of age.

      "title": "Schizophrenia and Autism--Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The clinical connections between schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have long been recognized. More than a century ago, Bleuler ascribed 4 primary symptoms to the group of disorders he termed “schizophrenia”: autism (turning inward to oneself), ambivalence, affective disturbance, and loosening of associations.1 In 1933, Potter described childhood SCZ as including: (1) loss of interest in the environment; (2) dereistic thinking; (3) thought disturbance; (4) difficulties with emotional rapport; (5) decreased or distorted affect; and (6) behavioral alterations, such as markedly increased or decreased activity, perseveration, or stereotypies.2,3 A decade later, when Leo Kanner published his seminal case series, “Autistic disturbances of affective contact,”4 the 11 youth he described were thought by many to be suffering from infantile psychosis. Presenting with social detachment, absence of communicative language, behavioral rigidity, and an interest in objects over people, these children shared many of the symptoms outlined by Potter—an apparent lack of interest in the environment, difficulties with emotional rapport, decreased affect and abnormal behaviors, including perseverations and stereotypies. However, Kanner’s cohort differed in one notable way—all had symptom onset within the first 2 years of life.5 This difference in illness onset and course ultimately proved to be the key factor supporting the differentiation of ASD from childhood SCZ, a conceptual shift that occurred gradually over a period of several decades. The demarcation was clarified in the 1980 publication of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III), which noted that the lack of psychotic symptoms and prominence of social deficits clearly distinguished ASD from SCZ.6 Thus, ASD moved out from under the umbrella of psychotic disorders and began to be considered as a separate entity.\r\n\r\nAlthough DSM-5 maintains nosologic separation of ASD and SCZ, comparison of the diagnostic criteria for the 2 disorders shows that they have marked similarities in clinical presentation. ASD is defined by 2 major criteria: (1) persistent deficits in social communication, social interactions, social-emotional reciprocity, and communicative behaviors and (2) restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, which include stereotyped or repetitive movements, behavioral rigidity, odd or intense interests, and abnormally high or low reactivity to sensory stimuli.7 The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for SCZ require at least 2 of the following symptoms be present: hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and/or negative symptoms.7 Although hallucinations, delusions, and thought (speech) disorder are essential features of SCZ (and are not present in ASD), the negative symptoms are often more impairing, pervasive, and treatment resistant.8 These negative symptoms, which include asociality, alogia, and low levels of emotional expression (also an indicator of impaired nonverbal communication) can be construed more broadly as deficits in social communication and motivation. Thus, the negative symptoms of SCZ share many features in common with the social deficits of ASD. Similarly, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior as described in SCZ includes a number of signs and symptoms consistent with those of ASD Criterion B, such as repeated stereotyped movements, echolalia, unpredictable agitation, and decreased interaction with or interest in one’s environment.\r\n\r\nGiven the shared clinical manifestations of SCZ and ASD, it is not surprising that the 2 disorders co-occur frequently. Nearly 30% of youth diagnosed with childhood onset SCZ in a large NIH cohort had co-morbid ASD,9 and both epidemiologic and retrospective clinical studies suggest an association between ASD diagnosis or childhood autistic traits and later psychotic experiences.10,11 Similar patterns of cognitive deficits have also been noted. For example, studies designed to assess systems for social processes demonstrate that facial recognition and emotion processing are impaired in SCZ12 as well as in ASD.13 Further, both groups have been shown to have deficits in social cueing associated with eye gaze, as well as in performance on theory of mind tasks.14–17 Meta-analyses of SCZ reports suggests that deficits are correlated with negative symptoms and disorganization.18,19\r\n\r\nAutism and SCZ also appear to share biological underpinnings that may begin very early in neural development. Whole exome sequencing analyses implicate ASD and SCZ risk genes in the development of deep layer cortical projection neurons in the prefrontal and primary motor-somatosensory cortical (ASD) and dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortical (SCZ) regions, respectively.20 A number of neurodevelopmental disorders with known genetic defects are associated with high rates of both ASD and SCZ, including 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, Shank3 mutations, and duplications at the Williams Syndrome locus (7q11.23), among others.20–22 Epigenetic effects and alterations in copy number variants have been reported to contribute to abnormalities of cerebral cytoarchitecture that have been related to SCZ and ASD.11 In addition, environmental factors, such as advanced paternal age and maternal infection/immune activation during pregnancy, have been reported to increase risk of both ASD and SCZ.23,24\r\n\r\nIn 1955, Eisenberg and Kanner wrote that early infantile autism was a “total psychobiological disorder,” and suggested that it was “probably related generically” to SCZ.5 After more than 5 decades of research and clinical experience, we are beginning to appreciate the veracity of their prediction, and to understand the nature of this relationship. Exploring commonalities between SCZ and ASD, while appreciating salient differences between the 2 disorders, should provide new insights into their etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention. To forward these efforts, the Schizophrenia Bulletin will provide occasional special features giving emphasis to key similarities and differences between SCZ and ASD and also welcomes high quality reports addressing these issues.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Our understanding of risk and aetiological processes in psychotic illness will only advance once we accurately identify the “end phenotype” of psychotic illness. This series of studies investigates the course of depression in first episode psychosis, its significance in terms of suicidal thinking, and relation to both diagnosis and other symptom domains. Depression in the acute and post psychotic phases is explored, through the importance of the awareness and appraisal of positive symptoms, and diagnosis itself. Significant findings include a pervasive nature of depression throughout the course of first episode psychosis, the predictive nature of prodromal depression and the high prevalence of suicidal acts. Appeasement and engagement with voices, subordination to persecutors and the (ineffective) use of safety behaviours drive a position of entrapment, demoralization and a lack of control. In addition negative illness appraisals are stable and may vary between cultural groups. Implications are explored, in terms of clinical practice, aetiological pathways, potential treatments and intervention strategies",

      "abstract": "Four cases were diagnosed as schizophrenic by careful observation and documentation. The patients had the following in common: 1. By all symptoms no schizophrenia was immediately apparent. It required time and attention to establish the diagnosis in all cases. But then it remained firmly established by the basic accepted criteria. 2. The patients were persons of good intelligence and had other assets as well. They tended to mobilize many mechanisms of defense as \"ego\" structure threatened to \"weaken\" further. These consisted both of additional neurotic defenses and some tendency toward \"acting-out,\" but no change was manifested in areas considered schizophrenic. Therefore, we are considering a category of individuals who belong to the group of schizophrenias according to legitimate definition, but apparently no more capable of disorganization, or display of blatant \"accessory\" symptoms, than the next person. In each of these instances, schizophrenic psychopathology comprised one part of the total picture, but did not thereby characterize the case. This concept differs from Hoch's \"pseudoneurotic schizophrenia\" (9) in that the latter describes an illness which is schizophrenic for all important clinical purposes: disorganization potential, therapeutic technique required, goals of therapy, and prognosis. By way of contrast, perhaps the best diagnostic approach to the above \"pseudoschizophrenic neurotic\" cases is the one or two paragraph description of psychopathology, with all factors evaluated on an individual basis.",

There are strong neuropathological similarities between ADHD and various concomitant psychiatric conditions. ADHD frequently coexists with learning and language disabilities, sleep disorders, impulse control personality and anxiety disorders, intellectual disability, substance use disorders and mood disorders, as well as autism spectrum disorders and tic disorders. The overlapping symptoms of ADHD and other morbidities constitute challenges but also an imperative need for the experts to be able to detect and clarify so as to achieve the proper diagnosis and the relative treatment. The expression of the disease differs accordingly depending on the age group and the presence of comorbidities. In school-age, symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. In adolescence, depending on the gender, hyperactivity decreases but the problems in learning and psychopathology still remain. Therefore, it is recommended that when ADHD coexists with other psychopathologies in childhood and adolescence to first and directly treat the most weakened condition so that the child or the adolescent can change the course of their psychiatric morbidity and improve their ability to function and socialize.",

It is thought to affect 1 in every 2000 persons over the age of 60 living in the community. Ethics are called in to question as the affected individual usually refuses assistance or treatment and health professionals tend to force care on this population. Individuals with this syndrome are very resistant to receiving assistance and are often content to continue living in abysmal conditions. Developing a therapeutic rapport with the individual can be challenging, but of paramount importance. Without trusted support and guidance, there is unlikely to be any change achieved. The challenge exists of creating a delicate balance between respecting an individual's autonomy and ensuring personal safety. Using a harm reduction model approach to care is often effective with this population and it allows a high level of autonomy to be maintained. The individual's cognitive ability is often questioned as seemingly poor decisions are made to live in squalor conditions that differ in accordance with our social norms. With no medical involvement there is rarely a formal diagnosis of a dementia, however, dementia is suspected in many cases. Research and personal experience has shown that seniors with this syndrome have a 2 times greater risk of death upon admission to long term care than do other community dwelling seniors. There is value in liaising with community partners to support the individual to continue to live in the community.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is considered one of the leading psychiatric disorders due to its\r\n incidence of 1% in the general population. Due to its many presentations it can not be defined as\r\n a single entity, but rather a disorder with heterogeneous genetic, neurobiological, environmental\r\n and social background, manifested by a series of cognitive, behavioral and emotional deviations,\r\n which speaks in favor that there are no two identical clinical presentations of schizophrenia.\r\n Schizophrenia is also a chronic disorder, requiring long-term care. Because of its long duration,\r\n insufficiently known etiology, behavioral changes and alterations of psychic functions, and the\r\n fact that it most commonly occurs during late adolescence, schizophrenia significantly impairs\r\n work and social functionality of the affected individual and has a negative impact on both the\r\n quality of life of the patient and the patient’s family, health system and society in general.\r\n What has recently caught the field’s attention is the presence of comorbid somatic\r\n diseases in patients with schizophrenia who have not yet been adequately diagnosed and treated.\r\n One of the most common and severely debilitating is the metabolic syndrome. It is a syndrome\r\n consisting of a series of metabolic abnormalities that result from a number of factors, such as:\r\n inadequate nutrition, lack of physical activity and smoking, the effects of the psychotic disorder\r\n itself, as well as the potentially adverse effects of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.\r\n The term metabolic syndrome implies abdominal or central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia with\r\n lowered HDL-cholesterol, hypertension and hyperglycemia. If these metabolic disorders occur at\r\n the same time, the patient is at increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and the\r\n development of type II diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, along with suicide, is the most important\r\n cause of mortality in patients with schizophrenia. Metabolic abnormalities are known to be\r\n associated with chronic course of the disorder and long-term administration of certain\r\n antipsychotics. However, there is a possibility that metabolic parameters are impaired at the\r\n outset of the disorder, that is, when the first diagnosis of schizophrenia is made. That is in fact the\r\n main hypothesis of this research. The aim of the study was to prospectively examine and analyze the values of the\r\n aforementioned metabolic parameters and to determine if the metabolic syndrome is present in\r\n 30 subjects with the first episode of schizophrenia. Those values were compared with those of\r\n other 30 subjects, who were previously diagnosed with schizophrenia and another 30 subjects,\r\n who were not diagnosed with the disorder (healthy individuals). This study was conducted at the\r\n Clinic for Psychiatry of the UHC Sestre milosrdnice. For the purpose of the study, laboratory\r\n values of serum lipids and glucose, anthropometric measures, and the existence of nicotine\r\n dependence in the subjects were analyzed.\r\n The study did not confirm the hypothesis that metabolic parameters are abnormal at\r\n the very beginning of the disorder, when the diagnosis of schizophrenia is made for the first time\r\n in patients’ lives. The present parameters do not meet the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of\r\n metabolic disorder in patients with the first episode of schizophrenia.",

Differential diagnosis between Schizophrenia and Autistic Spectrum Disorder can be complicated. Some symptoms of autistic spectrum can be misinterpreted as psychosis. Autistic Spectrum Disorders can talk out loud to themselves and they have sensory stereotypes  which can be misinterpreted as hallucinations. Some beliefs and perceptions can be idiosyncratic and interpreted as psychotic. Some thought disorders (loose associations and illogical thinking) were not due to comorbid symptoms of schizophrenia, but pragmatic language abnormalities. Both disorders can present negative symptoms (social isolation, decrease emotional expression) and disorganization.

      "title": "The role of the cognitive biases along the psychosis continuum: from pathophysiology to treatment options",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia and related psychoses is primarily characterized by positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive disturbances. Cognitive factors crucial in the pathogenesis of psychosis are specifically studied in terms of cognitive biases that may play a role in the formation and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Cognitive biases refer to systematic errors in both cognitive processing and content that deviate from logical thinking. Cognitive biases can affect attention, decision-making/reasoning, memory recall, motivation or even attributional style. Psychotic-like experiences and psychotic disorders have been associated with a tendency to jump to conclusions, bias against disconfirmatory evidence and bias against confirmatory evidence as well as liberal acceptance bias. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia tend to present higher belief inflexibility in comparison to healthy individuals and are overconfident in wrong judgments. In the monitoring tasks showing they show a higher tendency to misattribute internally-generated stimuli to external sources (externalizing bias) (1). Finally, patients with schizophrenia tend to have excessive attention toward irrelevant, neutral or familiar stimuli known as the salience aberrant bias. There are several specific psychological interventions designed to ameliorate cognitive biases, such as Metacognitive Training (2,3), Thinking Well (4), Social Cognition and Interaction Training (5). These trainings have been shown to teach patients about cognitive biases and how they contribute to symptoms of psychosis and consequently how they can affect their daily life. There is an increasing number of studies showing results of these interventions in reducing cognitive biases and positive symptoms as well as improving clinical and cognitive insight.",

      "title": "Suicide in the Early Stage of Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Suicide is a relevant leading cause of death among patients affected by schizophrenia. Even if suicidal ideation may be present in different stages of disease, some differences have been described between the risk of suicide in patients experiencing first-episode of psychosis and those with long-term schizophrenia. It is particularly higher during the first year of illness and reaches a steady decline over the following years. Suicidal ideation and attempts may also be common among subjects with subthreshold psychotic experiences. Factors associated with the risk of suicide in the early phase of schizophrenia are previous suicidal attempts and social aspects: the lack of social support and stable relationships, social drift after the first- episode, social impairment. Also, several psychotic symptoms (suspiciousness, paranoid delusions, mental disintegration and agitation, negative symptoms, depression and hopelessness, command hallucinations) and substance abuse are associated to higher risk of suicide. It has been described that perfectionism and good levels of insight among individuals who have recently developed psychotic symptoms are significantly associated to higher numbers of suicidal attempts. Moreover, recent evidences show that prefrontal- cortex- based circuit dysfunction may be related to suicide in the early stage of schizophrenia. This narrative review summarizes available evidences on suicide in the early stage of schizophrenia and deals with issues to be further studied and discussed.",

The youth does not need to endorse any physiologic or mental distress to meet criteria for CD, although these youth often have poor self-esteem, are often irritable, and have rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides that are higher than the general population. Conduct disorder differs from personality disorders, in that for most individuals, the pattern of defiant behaviors remits prior to adulthood, although for a subgroup of these youth, CD is a precursor to antisocial personality disorder and=or substance-related disorders. A second diagnosis that is defined by behavior, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), occasionally develops into CD. Conduct disorder is distinguished from ODD because the behaviors in CD are more confrontational and destructive, and because CD has a poorer prognosis.",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term “psychotic disorders” refers to a broad conceptualization of conditions including primary psychoses, such as schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders, other disorders that are sometimes marked by psychotic features (e.g., borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder), and secondary psychotic disorders due to medical conditions or substances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium). As addressed in Ketter, et al. 2004 (“Psychotic Bipolar Disorders: Dimensionally Similar to or Categorically Different from Schizophrenia?,” cited in the Debate of Dimensional versus Categorical), controversy regarding relationships among mood disorders (particularly bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features) and schizophrenia is ongoing. The authors argue that while the respective dimensional (e.g., psychotic bipolar disorder as intermediate between non-psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorders) versus categorical debate persists, a mixed dimensional/categorical approach may best help elucidate pathophysiology and treatment options. Schizophrenia, specifically, is a severe and persistent form of mental illness often marked by positive symptoms (such as excesses and distortions in thoughts and sensory/perceptual experiences such as hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (behavioral deficits such as avolition, asociality, anhedonia, blunted affect, and alogia), disorganized symptoms (such as disorganized speech and behavior), movement symptoms (or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior such as catatonia), and impairments in cognition (such as memory and frontal/executive functions that include, for example, planning ability and initiation). Kring, et al. 2014 (Abnormal Psychology, cited under the Schizophrenia Spectrum) provides an excellent introductory-level overview of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The etiological (or causal) basis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders remains not wholly determined. Prevailing theories, however, ascribe to a diathesis-stress model, whereby biological factors (e.g., predispositions such as genetic liability) are believed to interact with adverse environmental factors (e.g., obstetric complications; adverse, stressful life events) over the course of development toward the manifestation of illness. This article offers a historical perspective of psychotic disorders, a review of etiological/theoretical models, a description of illness epidemiology and issues pertaining to sex differences and comorbidity, an outline of diagnostic considerations, a description of the schizophrenia spectrum, an examination of available assessment tools, the role of cognition/social cognition, a review of current evidence of neurobiological disruptions in psychosis (e.g., genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, hormones, neurotransmitters, other aspects of maldevelopment in the central nervous system), other laboratory markers (e.g., perceptual and attentional abnormalities, smooth-pursuit eye movement dysfunction), environmental factors (such as stress, toxins, and familial-expressed emotion), the importance of gene-environment interactions in psychotic disorders, and, finally, current directions pertaining to prevention and treatment (pharmacological and psychosocial). While various psychotic-related disorders are addressed, this article focuses on the schizophrenia spectrum.",

As described elsewhere, we think the term \"giving-up\" is expressive of more than what is usually subsumed under the heading of a feeling. In our work we have come to view feelings as indicators of general intrapsychic adaptation. On this basis, \"giving-up\" indicates not only an unpleasant feeling but includes a loss of self-esteem, a disruption in object relationships, a decrease in motivation, and an expectation that such a state may be enduring.

Psychosis in multiple sclerosis, while not common, does occur in approximately 5% of cases, although it is probably under reported. Neurological changes, alterations in brain chemistry or severe stress such as that brought on by diagnosis or the impact of multiple sclerosis, can lead to the development of psychosis Psychosis may also occur as a result of treatment with steroids or other drugs. The duration and intensity of the psychotic episode can be variable, ranging from mild loss of contact with reality, to severe loss of a grasp on reality, with full delusional episodes; to complete catatonia.

At least two subtypes of social phobia, discrete and generalized, are seen in clinical samples, with the latter subtype being associated with greater functional impairment. The onset of social phobia is early, usually preceding the onset of comorbid conditions such as major depression or alcohol use disorders. It thus represents a potential tar-gel for early intervention by those who seek to ameliorate the condition and thereby prevent secondary complications.",

Similar to the own experience the literature shows only little social prestige given to patients with epilepsy, an experience known from persons with psychiatric disorders. The prevalence rate for chronic epilepsy is 0.5%. So called genuine seizures decreased with diagnostic progress during the last years (about 50%). Lower social classes and negative social patterns are characteristic of employees with epileptic fits. Unemployed persons show normal social structure. A relation to social class and onset of epilepsy exists. Epileptics are socially immobile. Like other persons with chronic diseases epilepsy produces a special social attitude and often negative therapeutic motivation. In contrast to the literature non-hospitalized epileptics show normal intelligence. Neurotic symptoms are seen in many cases however (about 40%). Often social disturbances origin from broken home situations. There is no specific social and mental defect. According to the own experience social integration of epileptics depends upon the local economic structure. The common prejudice varies with the local area. Social drop-outs are not due to the seizures, but occur mainly in mentally retarded persons who are not able to follow therapeutic regimens. Delinquency is increased among the own patients (18%). The causes are psychoorganic syndromes, often in connection with negative therapeutic motivation and alcoholism. The tendency to specific crimes, known from the literature, could not be confirmed. Forensic problems in direct connection with epileptic fits are rare. Medical problems concerning ability to drive often occur. Many patients possess a driver licence (46.5%), gained after onset of epilepsy in 50%. But the accident rate is lower than in the general population. Special outpatient departments and therapeutic groups for epileptics--affiliated to neurological centers--can improve the exact diagnosis, therapeutic motivation and social integration.",

Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

Unfortunately, lacking knowledge about the underlying pathophysiology limit early identification and indicated prevention efforts. Therefore, early characterization of the 'prodromal\" (subsyndromal) stages of depression and, especially, bipolar mania have attracted increasing attention, especially in youth, given the early age of first depression and bipolar disorder symptom onset. Review of phenomenological manifestations of the prodromal stages preceding syndromal unipolar depression and bipolar disorder, including antecedent and comorbid conditions. While offspring mood disorder studies are ongoing, clinical 'high-risk\" mood disorder research is relatively new. So far, retrospective and early prospective data suggest that a clinical prodrome exits in a sizeable patient group of patients subsequently developing unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. Moreover, phenomenologically, the early clinical depression or mania prodrome includes character traits that may become more pronounced, non-specific symptoms of decreasing role and social functioning, as well as subthreshold depressive and/or attenuated (hypo)mania-like symptoms (especially mood swings/lability, racing thoughts and sleep abnormalities). Frequent comorbidities that overlap with mood disorder criteria, the fact that several concurrent supratheshold symptoms can coexist that are still subthreshold for the full mood disorder and the episodicity of emerging as well as full mood symptoms are complicate the identification of the mood disorder prodrome. Data suggest that a relevant proportion of patients ultimately developing unipolar depression or bipolar disorder presents with a clinically identifiable depressive or (hypo)mania 'prodromal\" symptom stage that may enable indicated prevention. Prospective clinical and biological risk marker studies, utilizing specific instruments that target at-risk phenomenology are needed to advance the clinical high-risk and prevention approach for mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mental health problems, specifically mental disorders, develop from a complex system and not from a single cause. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects more than 2% of the population and generally the course of the illness is insidious and chronic. When functioning adequately, family constitutes a very important resource to face health problems and to help to improve the patient’s life quality. This is the reason why it is important to underline the relevance of a stable, good functioning of the family system aimed at attaining an optimal development of all its members. Such development may be hindered by the family’s incapability to modify functioning patterns at crucial moments when they are trapped in a series of inadaptable interactions which prevent to give specific solutions to the problems that are appearing, and when reporting, within a context of expressed emotion, an emotional over-involvement and high levels of hostility and criticism towards the member with OCD. Family accommodation is a phenomenon typical of families where the identified patient exerts a control based on aggressiveness when his/her wishes are not rewarded within the group. There are very few researches on the functioning of families of patients diagnosed with obsessivecompulsive disorder. Generally, these researches are related with the partially negative effects that the interactions have on the behavior of patients and their relatives by preventing or hindering the development of the subject’s system. The accordance between the patient’s emotional regulation or emotional intelligence and their relatives has not been studied. On the other hand, the knowledge of the beliefs that relatives hold regarding the illness may be related with the functioning of the group as a family, whereas beliefs will provide consistency to family life because they provide continuity between past, present and future. They are also a way to address new and ambiguous situations such as mental illness. This is the reason why getting to know these family systems may allow elaborating more specific and effective intervention programs for groups and families.",

      "abstract": "The nature of the physical symptoms may imply greater depth of psychopathology, a more pervasive precipitating trauma, and/or more deeply embedded symptoms by the time the patient is seen by the psychiatrist. The psychological factors, accompanying symptoms, and treatment approaches vary widely, depending upon the patient's emotional characteristics and the specific physical disorder specified on Axis III. W. P. Ross, J. R. Schultz, and P. Edelstein described cases in which incomplete early treatment of psychologically significant stressors and the symptoms precipitated led to both medical and psychological problems in the future. An initial behavior analysis to establish a correlation between psychological factors and somatic illness should be exhaustive. Modifying patterns of communication and relationships, altering behavioral patterns, broadening the patient's perception of external and internal situations, and use of biofeedback or other conditioning techniques may be helpful for specific goals.",

      "title": "Childhood Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Presenting as Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders",
      "abstract": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, presenting with a wide array of symptoms. Sometimes, OCD can appear to be psychotic in nature, with periods of loss of insight or the emergence of paranoid ideas. Likewise, individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs), including schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder, can have obsessive-compulsive or \"obsessive-compulsive like\" symptoms. The complexities of differentiating obsessive-compulsive symptoms from true psychotic symptoms have been recognized in adults. However, in the child and adolescent OCD literature, this has just begun to be explored. In children, limited insight regarding their obsessions and compulsions often makes it more difficult to differentiate OCD from psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia. This report describes 2 adolescents who were initially diagnosed with \"difficult-to-treat\" SSDs, leading to the use of third-line antipsychotic treatments such as clozapine. Once the core symptoms were recognized as obsessions and compulsions, and appropriately treated, the apparent \"psychosis\" resolved and did not return over extended follow up. Awareness of the possibility of OCD presenting as if it were a schizophrenia spectrum disorder can facilitate proper diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Aproximately 1% of the population suffers from schizophrenia, a mental disorder that results in devastating consequences for the person who struggles with it. During the last decades, research is showing that schizophrenia is part of a spectrum of aetiologically and phenomenologically related disorders that includes psychotic disorders like delusional disorder, for example, but also nonpsychotic disorders, as it is the case of schizotypal personality disorder, and, probably, schizotypy features as those measured in this thesis. These disorders tend to have their onset in late adolescence and early adulthood, causing a big disruption in the transition to adulthood with tremendous consequences devastating for independent living and functioning. Also, it has been suggested that schizophrenia spectrum disorders represent the most extreme manifestation of a continuum known as schizotypy. It is hypothesized that there is a continuum that ranges from minimal impairment to psychotic illnesses. Thus, schizotypy is a useful construct for studying the aetiology, development and expression of schizophrenia and related disorders, and ultimately, for the identification of individuals at risk for psychotic disorders or the development of preventive treatment interventions, independently of the effects that schizophrenic patients suffer (hospitalization, stigma, etc.). The studies presented in the present dissertation contribute to the research progress and understanding of the psychosis continuum by 1) providing reliable and word-wide used measures of schizotypy in Spanish language, 2) adding further evidence of the multidimensionality of the scales and the cross-cultural validity of this structure, and 3) showing that schizotypy dimensions have the same psychopathological and functional correlates (construct validity) and moderating factors in nonclinical individuals as presented by psychotic patients, a necessary condition to support the continuum hypothesis.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) frequently co-occur with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and can lead to misdiagnosis with schizophrenia (SCZ) or other primary psychotic disorders. Misdiagnosis is more common when AVH meet criteria for Schneiderian first rank symptoms (FRS). This paper's objective is to improve diagnostic accuracy by outlining particular clinical features that can assist the distinction between BPD and psychotic disorders in these cases.The overall clinical presentation when AVH occur in BPD can assist in determining a primary diagnosis of BPD when frank psychotic disorder is absent. AVH in BPD cannot be distinguished phenomenologically from AVH in SCZ. Clinical experience and increasing research suggest that AVH in BPD are often dissociative in origin and highly correlated with the presence of FRS, elevated levels of dissociation and a history of childhood trauma. When AVH occur in BPD in the absence of co-occurring psychotic disorder, formal thought disorder is usually absent, negative symptoms minimal or absent, bizarre symptoms absent, affect reactive and the patient retains sociability. Psychotropic medication may be less effective for the AVH in these cases, while they may improve or remit during psychotherapy for BPD.",

The self was defined as the minimal self which has an immediate experiential reality, and schizophrenia as a self-disorder rather than presence and prevalence of psychotic symptoms. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and the transcripts were analyzed using IPA (Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis). The analysis resulted in four categories. Many of the described experiences could be seen as expressions of self-disorders, although accounts of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions also emerged. Regarding differentiation between schizophrenia and psychosis the results go in line with theories of schizophrenia as a self-disorder, among other things due to schizophrenia being described as a latent condition, in contrast to psychosis, which was referred to as episodic. The sense of agency, of having influence over what one thinks, feels and does, proved to be an important factor that could mediate the quality of psychosis. In many cases the onset of schizophrenia or a psychotic episode resulted in seeing oneself and the world in a different light. (Less)",

      "title": "Paranoid, Schizotypal, and Schizoid Personality Disorders",
      "abstract": "Individuals with paranoid, schizotypal, and schizoid personality disorders (PDs) have in common a disinclination to interact with others, often coupled with a diminished capacity for empathic understanding of other people's emotions. In contrast, persons with avoidant PD, albeit shy, usually are more empathic. Patients with these three disorders tend to be guarded, not so self-revealing, and therefore less amenable than are many of the other PDs to psychodynamic treatment approaches. The therapeutic literature on these disorders is sparse. For simplicity's sake, each of the three disorders may be thought of as corresponding to a prototypical trait, selected for being the most characteristic feature (Livesley 2001). These traits are suspiciousness for paranoid PD (PPD), eccentricity for schizotypal PD (STPD), and aloofness (or \"emotional detachment\") for schizoid PD (SZPD). Individuals with these disorders also demonstrate typical defense mechanisms: paranoid persons tend to employ externalization, blaming others regardless of the problem. Schizoid persons are apt to show dismissiveness. Schizotypal persons often show some admixture of paranoid or schizoid traits; their typical defense mechanisms depend on the balance of those tendencies in their makeup. The empathic deficiency in schizotypal persons affects primarily their ability to read other people's minds correctly; their capacity for the compassionate aspect of empathy is often fairly well preserved. They can react with sadness, for example, upon learning of the troubles of someone else. Although the three disorders represent categories of personality, in actual practice persons displaying enough traits to be diagnosed with one disorder will likely show at least a few traits compatible with the other two—or with still other categories of personality disorder. Thus, a schizotypal person may show some paranoid traits, and a paranoid person may also show schizoid traits as well as narcissistic or antisocial traits. Therapists must therefore regard personality in dimensional terms: how much of the various categories does the person in question manifest? The actual admixture will affect both amenability to treatment and the optimal approach to treatment. Amenability will be less, for example, if a patient with (mainly) a schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid configuration also has significant antisocial features. For the three main personality types under discussion here, this chapter includes guidelines and suggestions for treatment, encompassing the broad areas of therapy: individual, group, and psychopharmacological.",

DS can be secondary when associated to psychosis or bipolar disorder, or primary when it occurs as a single entity, usually in the elderly. DS is a clinically complex transnosographic syndrome for which multidimensional approaches need to be considered: medical, psychiatric, neurological, social, scientific, and ethical. Known for more than 40 years mainly by geriatricians, psychiatrists, nurses or social workers and more recently by forensic specialists, the fine grained mechanisms of the syndrome are still incompletely understood. From a neurocognitive standpoint, frontal vulnerability certainly disrupts normal decision-making processes, explaining squalor, pathological hoarding, and lack of insight but we need to better understand the connection between the main symptoms and the neural underpinning of the full syndrome. We should definitely intervene earlier, before patients refuse any help, and when the syndrome is supposedly milder, to improve our clinical knowledge, follow patients prospectively, experiment hypothesis in laboratory settings, and launch randomized controlled trials for treatments. There is hope for future pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to alleviate this socially disastrous condition.",

The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders.

This may explain why patients with BPD tend to develop strong attachments to transitional objects such as stuffed animals. Research in hospital settings has linked the use of transitional objects to the presence of BPD. Using a nonclinical community sample (N = 80) we explored the link between attachments to transitional objects and various aspects of personality pathology, as well as to childhood trauma, and parental rearing styles. People who reported intense current attachments to transitional objects were significantly more likely to meet criteria for a BPD diagnosis than those who did not; they also reported more childhood trauma, rated their early caregivers as less supportive, and had more attachment problems as adults. Heavy emotional reliance on transitional objects in adulthood may be an indicator of underlying pathology, particularly BPD.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

      "abstract": "Two different types of pathology can cause social withdrawal: the narcissistic--schizoid personality organization (NSPO) type and the mild Asperger's syndrome (mild developmental disorders) type. Only the former type can be treated by psychoanalytic psychotherapy. In the childhood of both types, one may find traumatic family environments which will result in social withdrawal (Hikikomori). In the infancy of the NSPO type, the mother fails to function as a sufficient container of the child's emotion, which encourages formation of a schizoid personality organization i.e. the psychic withdrawal (or \"psychic retreat\" by Steiner, J.). With only a little failure in life events, this may turn into a physical withdrawal for a long time. And in this type of pathology their aggression takes a passive form that hardens their social withdrawal situation. Moreover, the social withdrawal itself serves to reinforce the pathological narcissism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Affective disorders—depression and mania—occurring with no preexisting psychiatric condition, severe physical illness, or recent personal loss can be divided into unipolar (depression only) and bipolar (both manic and depressive episodes) disorders. Bipolar illness is transmitted in some families as an X‐linked dominant factor. In other families, X‐linked transmission does not occur. Hence, bipolar illness may be similar to retinitis pigmentosa. This makes some types of genetic counseling difficult to apply to bipolar families. There is no evidence that unipolar depressive illness is transmitted by an X‐linked factor. Family studies indicate that there might be more than one type of unipolar illness. Limited prediction of risk of depression and other psychiatric conditions in other family members can be based on family studies which show that alcoholism and personality disorder occur frequently in families of early onset depressives but much less frequently in families of late onset depressives (age 40 or older).",

      "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia often experience aberrant bodily self including depersonalization and cenesthopathy, especially in its prodromal and early stage. These symptoms are regarded as the beginning of self-disturbances (i.e. the core psychopathology of the illness). Thus, an understanding of schizophrenic bodily experiences could provide insight into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Recently, in the field of cognitive neuroscience, research on self-awareness during intentional actions has focused on examining sense of body ownership (SoO) and sense of agency (SoA). The most critical factor for the emergence of those higher-order senses of self is subject's intention for actions. Intentional signals could integrate multiple bodily sensory feedbacks during actions, and lead to develop a coherent sense of self. Empirical studies using behavioral and neuroimaging experiments have demonstrated that schizophrenic patients exhibit specific patterns of abnormal SoO and SoA. Thus, from a clinical standpoint, the detection of specific nature of schizophrenic bodily experiences could provide evidence for early diagnosis and intervention for schizophrenia.",

Paraphilic disorders are defined as persistent, intense and atypical forms of sexual excitement that appear with clinically significant functional impairment. The original clinical use of the terms sadism and masochism was to describe the sexual perversions of attaining sexual pleasure by hurting or being hurt. These terms have been usefully expanded to mean emotional sadism and masochism: experiencing emotional satisfaction or comfort due to exercising power over another or submitting to another’s power. This disorder begins at an early age and most sadists and masochists are actually satisfied with their unconventional sexual activity. Personality disorders are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, based on descriptive similarities. Group B in the classification of personality disorder is composed of an antisocial, histrionic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorder. People who fall into this group are characterized by impulsiveness and emotional instability, in their behavior they are dramatic and mischievous. Unlike true love, falling in love by itself is not a conscious choice nor a willing act. Love constitutes a voluntary act with which spritiual growth and maturity of ourselves and others is achieved. Similarly, love is action, not a feeling. In every long-lasting romantic relationship, including sadomasochistic ones, mutual respect and paying atttention play a major role.",

      "title": "Borderline personality disorder: a comprehensive review of diagnosis and clinical presentation, etiology, treatment, and current controversies",
      "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) was introduced in the DSM‐III in 1980. From the DSM‐III to the DSM‐5, no major changes have occurred in its defining criteria. The disorder is characterized by instability of self‐image, interpersonal relationships and affects. Further symptoms include impulsivity, intense anger, feelings of emptiness, strong abandonment fears, suicidal or self‐mutilation behavior, and transient stress‐related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms. There is evidence that BPD can be reliably diagnosed and differentiated from other mental disorders by semi‐structured interviews. The disorder is associated with considerable functional impairment, intensive treatment utilization, and high societal costs. The risk of self‐mutilation and suicide is high. In the general adult population, the lifetime prevalence of BPD has been reported to be from 0.7 to 2.7%, while its prevalence is about 12% in outpatient and 22% in inpatient psychiatric services. BPD is significantly associated with other mental disorders, including depressive disorders, substance use disorders, post‐traumatic stress disorder, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, bulimia nervosa, and other personality disorders. There is convincing evidence to suggest that the interaction between genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences plays a central role in the etiology of BPD. In spite of considerable research, the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder remain to be clarified. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for BPD. Various approaches have been empirically supported in randomized controlled trials, including dialectical behavior therapy, mentalization‐based therapy, transference‐focused therapy, and schema therapy. No approach has proved to be superior to others. Compared to treatment as usual, psychotherapy has proved to be more efficacious, with effect sizes between 0.50 and 0.65 with regard to core BPD symptom severity. However, almost half of the patients do not respond sufficiently to psychotherapy, and further research in this area is warranted. It is not clear whether some patients may benefit more from one psychotherapeutic approach than from others. No evidence is available consistently showing that any psychoactive medication is efficacious for the core features of BPD. For discrete and severe comorbid anxiety or depressive symptoms or psychotic‐like features, pharmacotherapy may be useful. Early diagnosis and treatment of BPD can reduce individual suffering and societal costs. However, more high‐quality studies are required, in both adolescents and adults. This review provides a comprehensive update of the BPD diagnosis and clinical characterization, risk factors, neurobiology, cognition, and management. It also discusses the current controversies concerning the disorder, and highlights the areas in which further research is needed.",

These are (in the order listed in DSM-IV): ... Note: ... This chapter will focus mainly on autism and Asperger's—the other PDD's are included for completeness, but as they are relatively rare they will not be covered in any detail.

This recurring disorder is associated with significant psychological distress, a decrease in health-related quality of life and psychiatric morbidity. The most common psychiatric comorbidities are mental retardation, personality disorder and affective disorders. Objectives The authors’ aim is to present a clinical vignette of a 27-year-old male suffering from psoriasis who was admitted to the psychiatric yard exhibiting psychotic symptoms. A literature's review about the association between psychosis and autoimmune disorders, particularly with psoriasis vulgaris, was also made. Case report The patient is a 27-year-old single male with normal IQ. He had no physical ilnesses during childhood and adolescence. There was no history of psychiatric or developmental disorders in the patient and his family. In early adulthood he was diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris. The patient's father also suffered from the same skin disorder. At the age of 27 he began to hear voices commenting on his behaviour and he exhibited psychomotor agitation, delusions of persecution, and sexual disinhibition. Admission in psychiatric yard was necessary to treat psychotic symptoms. Conclusions The skin and the brain are embryologically related. Consequently, a relationship between psychological factors and skin diseases has long been hypothesized. Schizophrenia has been associated with nearly 50% higher lifetime prevalence of one or more autoimmune disorders but further studies are necessary to elucidate the possible association between psoriasis vulgaris and psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Selective mutism is a communication disorder of the child, defined as the persistant inability to speak in one or more social situations whereas the child is capable of understanding language and of speaking in other situations. This trouble is generally extra-familial and mainly concerns girls. Until recently, it was considered to be rare but is, in fact, quite probably under-diagnosed. It often begins before the age of five and several years may elapse before it is identified and treatment is begun. It can be symptomatic of quite a number of diverse personality organizations which must be considered before it is possible to offer a prognosis and the appropriate treatment. Many psychopathological hypotheses exist to explain the origin of this complex disorder. Several factors have been associated with it such as difficulties in the mother/child relationship, separation anxiety, immigration, a psychological traumatism, the notion of a family secret, and more recently, social phobia (or, more generally, anxiety troubles). The prognosis of this disorder is reserved, depending essentially on the underlying psychopathological structure, the precocity of the diagnosis and treatment, the family psychopathology and possible associated troubles such as intellectual deficiency, psychomotor or language developmental delays. To obtain the best chances of success, treatment must be global (including the child, his family and teachers) and « multi-modal », associating individual therapy (analytic and/or cognitive-behavioral type), family therapy and pharmacological treatment (if the component of anxiety seems to be massively present).",

Persecutory delusions with and without hallucinations, organised delusions, and third-person, running commentary and accusatory or abusive auditory hallucinations were all more common in late-onset cases (age at onset 45 years or more; n = 134). There was no difference between cases of early and late onset in the prevalence of delusions of reference, bizarre delusions, delusional perception, or lack of insight.

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem.

Other aspects of personality are best understood as traits, rather than “disorders,” or as symptomatic changes that are acute and occur lower in the hierarchy of diagnosis than mood or psychotic states, and are caused by the latter. The common report of purported comorbidity is seen as an overestimation, with personality changes often being part of other conditions.

      "abstract": "Clinical psychopathology, as a discipline, is based on phenomenology (Jaspers, 1913). This has been helpful to avoid precocious inferences about possible pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders and to remain in contact with diverging theoretical stances despite differing diagnostic and therapeutic extrapolations originating from them. Unlike other psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, dissociative disorders cannot be conceived as a unitary phenomenon in the community. Even patients with dissociative identity disorder (DID) and its subthreshold forms may claim only a subgroup of their symptoms that dominate their mental status during index admission or represent a particular individual pattern. To make the situation more complex, in addition to constituting disorders in their own right, dissociation may accompany almost every psychiatric disorder and may influence their phenomenology as well as response to treatment. Psychological dissociation in particular has its origin in \"anger inside\" which turns to \"anger outside\" during overt depression.",

      "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with or without hyperactivity disorder is a neurobiological disorder that involves the interaction of the neuroanatomical and neurotransmitter systems. It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

When confronted with opposition, they can become pretentious, impertinent, and even verbally or physically aggressive. Trifling incidents can bring about open hostility and violent outbursts. Compounding that emotional irritability is the ever-present threat of depression. These hypomanic episodes alternate with depressive episodes. During these depressive episodes, people lose interest and enjoyment in what are normally pleasurable events. Hypomanics are also extremely social, ready to engage whomever they encounter. Consequently, they may get caught up in intense and impulsive romantic or sexual liaisons, even with workplace colleagues. Compared with more common mortals, hypomanics seem to need very little sleep; there are too many things to be done. Because their thoughts may race, often faster than they can articulate them, they may talk more loudly and rapidly than other people.",

Although their behaviour can escalate to apparently unprovoked, and sometimes severe, aggressive acts that suggest a lack of feeling towards others, the children have no deficit in empathy.

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DDD) is a common mental disorder, but it is rarely diagnosed and adequately treated. Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

However, affective psychoses (psychosis associated with mood disorders), dissociative psychoses (psychosis associated with PTSD or dissociative identity disorder), and psychoses associated with or secondary to substance abuse are commonly seen in clinical practice. Although the existence of childhood schizophrenia has been recognized since the early twentieth century (Kraepelin, 1919), the term “childhood psychosis” before the 1960s was used to refer to a heterogeneous group of pervasive developmental disorders without hallucinations and delusions. It was not until the 1980s that childhood‐onset schizophrenia (COS) was formally differentiated from autistic disorder, and that was after evidence was established that the clinical picture, family history, age of onset, and course of the two disorders were different. Even today, high rates of misdiagnosis remain, because transient psychotic symptoms can occur in healthy children, and fleeting hallucinations are not uncommon in nonpsychotic children, especially in the face of severe stress and anxiety. There is an increasing focus on COS as a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [AACAP], 2001).",

Patients pass through a number of identifiable stages of developmental pathways to SAD as they grow up. Patients with ADHD have maladaptive behaviours in social settings due to the symptoms of ADHD . These behaviours are criticized by their parents and social circle; they receive insults, humiliation and bullying. After each aversive incident, the individual feels shame and guilt. A vicious cycle emerges. The patients then develop social fears and a cognitive inhibition that occurs in social situations. The inhibition increases gradually as the fear persists and the individual becomes withdrawn. Patients start to monitor themselves and to focus on others’ feedback. Finally, performative social situations become extremely stimulating for them and may trigger anxiety/panic attacks. If this hypothesis is proven, treatment of ‘patients with SAD secondary to ADHD ’ should focus on the primary disease.",

The mother is irascible, the father aloof; on the other hand, the parental combination \"mother and father affectionate\" is more common. The father is often absent in early childhood, and there is the additional stress caused by changes of residence. In their earliest childhood memory, the mother and father are named as central reference persons. According to the impairment score, the schizoids are more severely disturbed. In contrast, hysterical patients have young mothers that taboo sexuality and irascible fathers; they criticize the mothers more and also idealize the father. The hysterically structured individual is an only child or has few siblings. As children, these patients are well-behaved, lively, athletic, have many friends, fight and compete with siblings. In their earliest childhood memory, they name other adults--not family members--and topics centering on possession and contact. Their childhood is affected by stress arising from the death of the father and other close reference persons as well as from flight experiences. The results make it possible to describe a markedly different line of development in the structure groups and a greater degree of stress due to various risk factors in the schizoids.",

      "title": "I paint, I sing, I dance; I also have a mental illness: The importance of personally meaningful leisure activities in recovery from severe mental illness",
      "abstract": "Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) often have sedentary and secluded life. It leads to compounded psychological and physical effects in the form of feeling isolated, having an increased propensity for lifestyle-related illnesses, and the like.[1] It affects the perception of others also, which often manifests as a narrow and negative approach to the patient and their problems. This approach creates an impression that the patient and their issues are inseparable and that their life revolves around those problems. It leads to neglect and underestimation of the patient's abilities, hobbies, and likings. For example, a patient with schizophrenia may be perceived as someone with eccentricities (e.g., talks to self) who does not adequately involve in daily living activities and remains secluded. Unfortunately, a patient may imbibe these perceptions leading to self-stigma, which, in turn, can affect their overall functioning.[2] It is, therefore, imperative that intervention for mental illness has a strength-based approach that focuses on the person's abilities apart from the target to improve the symptoms. Motivating patients to engage in personally meaningful activities they enjoy can be a step in this direction. It does not only defocus the attention of the patient and the caregivers from a \"symptom only\" approach but also help make the patient active, participative, and involved in what interests them. Given this, therapeutic recreation is being advocated as one of the ways to promote health and wellness in individuals with mental illness.[3] Therapeutic recreation promotes positive behaviour, such as social connectedness and cooperation, by involving people in therapeutic residential camping, leisure activities, and the like. Involving people in such leisure and recreational activities can be an effective way of reinvigorating those self-soothing and enjoyable activities that get subdued in the inactive life of mental illness. Furthermore, patients can be involved in such goal-driven recreational activities that reduce the illness effects. For example, specially designed cognitively stimulating recreational activities can effectively reduce the cognitive impairments commonly observed in people with severe mental illness. Likewise, group activities can help enhance social skills, decrease apathy (and other negative symptoms), and improve interpersonal skills. THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE Of late, there has been a surge of interest in understanding the effectiveness of leisure activities in promoting the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness. Research indicates that involvement in personally meaningful leisure activities can boost recovery and aid toward active living for people with mental illness.[4,5] For example, enjoyable leisure activities and perceived active living consistently correlate with a sense of well-being and recovery.[5–7] Therapeutic recovery camps, aiming to involve participants in physically and mentally challenging activities, have been found to lead to a sense of determination to overcome the challenges caused by mental illness.[3] Activities that involve adventure and fun (such as rock climbing, picnic, and skating) can be physically stimulating, weight reducing (a common requirement in mental illness due to metabolic abnormalities), and a boost to self-esteem.[8] Also, leisure activities can act as a protector from mental illness. For example, a sense of meaningful use of time through leisure activities is associated with lower depressive symptoms.[9,10] NOT \"ONE FIT FOR ALL\" Since recreational and leisure activities can significantly boost the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness, these activities must be part of the overall intervention plan. While doing this, a few things need to be kept in mind. For example: The activities chosen must be personally meaningful for the individual. The contribution of leisure activities in recovery and active living largely depends on what meanings the patients gain from those activities.[4,5] Perception of an activity to be personally meaningful motivates the individual to engage and continue it. For example, realizing that doing yoga with friends brings a positive mood, helps companionship, and revitalizes spirituality can be a driving force for engaging in it regularly.[4] Iwasaki and colleagues suggest that leisure activities can be meaningful for an individual if they promote a sense of belongingness, autonomy, competence, and other factors.[5] Active living does not limit to some physical exercises; it also involves activities that augment body-mind-spirit harmony and promote emotional health, social connectedness, creativity, and so on.[11] Recreational and leisure activities should be planned in a manner that it incorporates the patient's needs. For example, a patient with cognitive deficits can be involved in such activities that are cognitively stimulating. Involving patients to work in groups to create Rangolis (an art in which an array of colors is precisely used to create designs on the floor) can be an enjoyable activity with the potential to improve attention. INDIAN SCENARIO Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research from India about the effectiveness of therapeutic recreational activities for people with SMI. It has significant implications; for example, even if some centers involve patients in recreational activities, they are not guaranteed to be effective. At NIMHANS, we have started a structured recreational program that involves patients in various leisure activities according to their choice. A preliminary study shows that the patients perceive the benefits of these activities in terms of the experience of positive emotions, opportunities for social interactions, and the like.[12] We need more research exploring the utility of various approaches to actively include patients and their caregivers in focused recreational and leisure activities, such as recreational camping for a longer duration. We must remember that symptom amelioration is not the sole target of working with people with mental illness. Recovery is a broader concept with a strength-based perspective to enable an individual to lead a meaningful life and utilize their potential to the fullest. Recreational activities can serve as an important medium to attain this goal. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "Although characterologic constellations such as obsessionalism, dependency, introversion, restricted social skills, and maladaptive self-attributions are popularly linked to the pathogenesis of depressive disorders, the evidence in support of this relationship remains modest. Indeed, many of these attributes may reflect state characteristics woven into the postdepressive personality. Current evidence is strongest for introversion as a possible premorbid trait in primary nonbipolar depressions. By contrast, driven, work-oriented obsessoid, extroverted, cyclothymic, and related dysthymic temperaments appear to be the precursors of bipolar disorders. Other personalities, while not necessarily pathogenic in affective disorders, nevertheless may modify the clinical expression of affective disorders and their prognosis.",

      "abstract": "The term \"theory of mind\" (ToM) refers to the capacity to infer one's own and other persons' mental states (e.g. their beliefs, feelings, intentions or knowledge). It was found that children in the autistic spectrum have deficits in ToM. One of the suggestions was that unlike autistic people, ToM skills are normally developed in schizophrenia patients, but \"lost\" in the first psychotic episode. The deficit may disappear on remission from the acute phase, as described in some studies. A substantial body of research has highlighted the impaired ToM in schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms--for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms--may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and if it is a state or trate marker. The paper reviews the current literature and suggests potential implications and future research areas.",

The early psychoanalytic formulations of Abraham<sup>1</sup>and Freud<sup>2</sup>of the depressive reaction long ago became identified with the notions of self-accusation, guilt, and selfdestruction, so that nearly every depressive reaction was viewed either as resulting from or including the turning of the original object-directed aggression against the self, or from the internalized aggression against the incorporated loved and hated object. In such depressed patients, the tendency to express aggression against others has been seen as either denied, suppressed, or repressed, and hostile feelings toward the significant other not admitted into awareness where they would arouse painful guilt feelings. One more recent psychoanalytic position<sup>3</sup>is that depression is associated with denial, or repression of aggression, aimed at preserving the original love object",

Loneliness has been linked to a number of mental health indicators such as depressive symptoms, self-esteem, anxiety, and perceived stress. During adolescence, the individual undergoes major social and personal transformations through redefining their social network thus making them more susceptible to developing mental health problems. Some studies suggest that the risk of mental health problems arises when an adolescent is repeatedly faced with loneliness. Mental health workers should therefore focus on any given adolescent's inability to establish satisfactory interpersonal relationships as a predictive element of loneliness. Thus, it would seem that the development of loneliness prevention and intervention programs aimed at adolescents who are unable to establish satisfactory interpersonal relationships could be of benefit to many.",

Since the 1950s, however, initially with family therapy and then with psychoeducation, specific work with families including a member with schizophrenia has been developed. The signs that these approaches have identified in the functioning of the family (double-bonds, expressed emotions, deviant behavior) are closely related to caregiver burnout or familial post-traumatic stress disorder. It is therefore a question of identifying families facing such problems, in order to implement a specific family therapy that takes into account traumatic effects such as severe loss of autonomy. This approach is complementary to peer group and family psychoeducation.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

Some patients are able to sustain a certain level of social and occupational functioning, while others experience a very high level of emotional distress. There is often rapid fluctuation from periods of confidence to despair. A large proportion of those affected are unrecognised and untreated. Women present to services three times more often than men. Most people show symptoms in late adolescence or early adult life. BPD is not entirely related to environmental factors. A study of more than 40 twin pairs showed high heritability. One common denominator of BPD appears to be dysfunctional regulation of emotions. People with BPD present at times of crisis, often following an episode of self-harm. Presentation is accompanied by a sense of urgency and anxiety. People with BPD have marked difficulty differentiating reality from fantasy, so that health problems may be perceived as life threatening. This may result in loss of perspective and miscommunication with the GP. The doctor should provide very clear information to counter any elaborate fantasies about their illness. Patients with suspected BPD should be referred to a psychiatrist for assessment and diagnosis.",

In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms.

GPs may have only a few patients with chronic schizophrenia on their lists but the severity of their problems and the needs of their families will make these patients important. This chapter aims to provide sufficient infor­mation for the reader to be able to recognize the basic symptoms of schizophrenia and related dis­orders and to be aware of the main approaches to treatment. As the clinical presentation and outcome of the dis­order vary, schizophrenia can be a confusing illness to understand. It is best to start by considering simplified descriptions of two common presenta­tions: (1) the acute syndrome, and (2) the chronic syndrome. It is then easier to understand the core features as well as the diversity of schizophrenia. In the acute syndrome, the patient gains symptoms; they start to have unusual experiences or thoughts they did not previously, and act in bizarre or atypical ways. This is in contrast to the contrast to the chronic syndrome, in which there is a loss of function— the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia may appear within a few days, or more insidiously over a period of weeks. A typical presentation is described in Case study box 22.1, and symptoms outlined in Table 22.1. It is not necessary for the patient to have all of these symptoms; they usually have a selection which may change over time.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia in Late Life: Findings Challenge Traditional Concepts",
      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Nursing is a science as well as an art, filled with profound techniques, many of which have been incorporated in the field for centuries. A nurse must be well adept in assessing human needs, emotions, reactions and behaviors while knowing how to appropriately respond medically as well as intuitively . A nurse must also take special measures when dealing with patients with schizophrenia to determine a mutual sharing and trusting relationship to promote patient understanding and recovery. Schizophrenia deals with a separation between cognitive and emotional traits of personality; a neurodevelopmental brain disorder. This condition exhibits positive and negative symptoms, with several subtypes including disorganized, paranoia, and catatonic. There are those that are more at risk including individuals who experience attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, or trait and state risk factors. Insight to developing schizophrenia can be observed during childhood although many of these childhood behaviors are generally grouped as developmental milestones . Late-onset schizophrenia is also a possibility and more risks are seen in women and those who have other delusional diagnoses. Treatment is adjusted appropriately depending on the patient's responses to the intended drug. Many go through phases including the acute, stabilization, and maintenance phase with goals to prevent relapse. However, effectiveness of the drug is altered based on the patient's willingness and consistency of taking the medication s . Practicing nursing with patients who have S chizophrenia requires considerable effort to recognize psychosis and work together to eventually reach a plateau of effective treatment with the goal of stabilization or recovery.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric emergencies faced by adolescents are often linked to developmental issues such as separating from parents, establishing attachments to peers, and developing autonomy. In a vulnerable adolescent, a stressful developmental event may trigger a pathological response--acute anxiety, depression with or without suicidal ideation or behavior, severe conduct disturbance, a first psychotic episode, or explosive or violent behavior--that requires emergency psychiatric treatment. The basic components of an emergency psychiatric evaluation of an adolescent include initial observation of the patient, taking a history, interviewing the patient and others accompanying the patient, conducting a mental status examination, making a diagnosis, and planning for disposition and further treatment. Such an evaluation may be the first contact with the mental health system for many adolescents, and the intervention of a sensitive clinician may help the adolescent be more comfortable seeking mental health care in the future.",

Inability to show dissatisfaction and inhibition of one's own aggressive tendencies are characteristic of depressive neurosis.

      "title": "A PRISONER OF WAR SYNDROME: APATHY AS A REACTION TO SEVERE STRESS",
      "abstract": "We have pointed out that one defensive adjustment of POW's to stress is withdrawal. If the stresses are not too severe the person will withdraw physically if possible, or in any case will refuse to allow himself to become involved with the environment to as great an extent as possible. Certain kinds of overt behavior will be inhibited and most emotional responses will be suppressed. If the environment is severely stressful and physically depriving as well, the individual may regress into a more complete withdrawal and adopt a maladaptive state of dependency in which he ceases to take care of himself even to the point of death. We have labelled this type of defense \"apathy\" and distinguish it from states like catatonic stupor, or depression. \"Apathy\" appears not to be a single absolute reaction, but a syndrome which can vary markedly in degree. One major symptom in the syndrome is reduced or modulated affect, but only in extreme cases can one speak of true apathy or affectlessness. Other symptoms are listlessness, uncommunicativeness, lack of spontaneity, indifference, slowed reactions, lack of enthusiasm, and lack of initiative. It is important to note that underlying the overt lack of emotional spontaneity may lie great quantities of pent-up feelings, and that these will continue to be a problem to the individual when he is no longer in the environment that produced the \"apathy syndrome.\" The apathy syndrome serves to maintain personality integration in the face of severe reality and psychological stresses.",

They pose a challenge and anxiety to sufferers, to their families and to professionals involved in assessment and treatment. Accurate and early diagnosis, coupled with appropriate treatment, is essential to minimise secondary handicaps. However, their rarity means that professionals are frequently unfamiliar with some aspects of presentation or management and that appropriate service provision is not readily available (e.g. admission directly into an in-patient bed in an age-appropriate environment). A lack of age-appropriate provision may also mean that adult psychiatrists are occasionally called on to manage and treat a younger teenager presenting with a psychotic disorder.",

      "title": "How Should DSM-V Criteria for Schizophrenia Include Cognitive Impairment?",
      "abstract": "Neurocognitive impairment is considered a core component of schizophrenia and is increasingly under investigation as a potential treatment target. On average, cognitive impairment is severe to moderately severe compared with healthy controls, and almost all patients with schizophrenia demonstrate cognitive decrements compared with their expected level if they had not developed the illness. Compared with patients with affective disorders, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia appears earlier, is more severe, and tends to be more independent of clinical symptoms. While the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, description of schizophrenia includes several references to cognitive impairment, neither the diagnostic criteria nor the subtypology of schizophrenia include a requirement of cognitive impairment. We forward for consideration a proposal that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria include a specific criterion of \"a level of cognitive functioning suggesting a consistent severe impairment and/or a significant decline from premorbid levels considering the patient's educational, familial, and socioeconomic background.\" The inclusion of this criterion may increase the \"point of rarity\" with affective psychoses and may increase clinicians' awareness of cognitive impairment, potentially leading to more accurate prognosis and better treatment outcomes. Future research will need to address the validity of these possibilities. The reliable determination of cognitive impairment as part of a standard diagnostic evaluation may present challenges to diagnosticians with limited resources or insufficient expertise. Various cognitive assessment methods for clinicians, including brief assessments and interview-based assessments, are discussed. Given the current emphasis on the development of cognitive treatments, the evaluation of cognition in schizophrenia is an essential component of mental health education.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

We conclude that the majority of postpartum psychoses are affective in nature and that, despite the observation of “confusion” in many such presentations; the symptom picture is not sufficiently unique to warrant a separate diagnostic category. We could find no evidence of unique presentation of non‐psychotic postpartum depression. Nonetheless, because of the unique complications associated with postpartum disorders (e.g., disruption of the mother‐infant bond, infanticide), we recommend that postpartum presentations be given a more prominent place in the text of DSM‐IV and that a course specifier, “postpartum onset,” be applied to major depressive or manic/hypomanic episodes in Bipolar I, Bipolar II, or Major Depressive Disorder, or to Acute Psychotic Disorder when appropriate.

      "title": "Young GI angle: Imposter syndrome: What a young GI should know",
      "abstract": "Most of us have experienced self-doubt at some point in our lives. We may not feel as competent or knowledgeable as colleagues and friends perceive us to be, or may frequently attribute our success to chance. This destructive state of being is sometimes referred to as the imposter phenomenon, and almost 70% of people have felt some degree of imposter syndrome.1 It particularly affects high-achieving individuals in academic settings, such as PhD students, postdoctoral scientists, and clinicians at all levels of training. Prevalence appears to be increased among people from minority backgrounds who are underrepresented in medicine and academia.2 Studies have shown that imposter syndrome is associated with maladaptive perfectionism, depression, and even suicidal risk.1 Imposter syndrome is pervasive self-doubt and insecurity which creates a cloud over everything you do, a constant nagging feeling of stress and anxiety which affects both your work and relationships and pushes you to reach for perfection. As perfection does not exist in this life, you rarely feel pleased with your achievements or with who you are. Your family and friends see you as capable and accomplished, meaning that your inner turmoil often goes unnoticed. To them it seems that everything is okay, or better, they think that you are doing well. When you receive positive feedback, you think it is just because people like you and they are being nice, not because you actually deserve their appreciation. No matter how much evidence there is against the idea that you are not good enough, you hold on tightly to this belief and methodically, internally build up an argument to make yourself believe this. You fail at internalising your accomplishments and feel uncomfortable when praised.1 The only way forward is to keep attention away from yourself, work hard, and never make a mistake. You work for long periods of time to hide the fact that you struggle, not submitting any work that is short of perfect. When drowning in these thoughts, you are in a very lonely place. By most people's standards, you would be considered successful, but the problem is that you don't see yourself in this way. The more success you achieve, the more pressure you feel as the visibility and responsibility increases. Instead of feeling a sense of accomplishment, you feel a sense of relief that you managed to succeed this time round, as well as guilt because you feel that it is not deserved. This feeling ruins the moments when you achieve your goals or simply do something great. You quickly sweep this away—a process that leaves you feeling exhausted at the prospect of doing it again. Imposter syndrome is not a disorder that people feel all the time but is a series of symptoms which runs on a continuum; from occasional worry that you are not capable of completing a task to full blown fears of being ‘found out’, the imposter suffers from chronic self-doubt and fear, making it hard to live in the moment.3 It can be triggered by any achievement or approval-related task or can result from feeling insecure about your knowledge or skill, particularly when you work in a competitive atmosphere and when responsibilities increase. It tends to be exacerbated at times of transition or change or when you are faced with new challenges. This pushes you out of your comfort zone into new routines and puts you under increased scrutiny. There are new codes to learn, a new role to play, and a new way of being. These feelings of insecurity can often occur when there is a conflict between the standard that you set yourself and how you measure yourself to be doing. When the image of yourself and what others see do not match up, you wrongly conclude that they must have an inflated idea of your abilities. When faced with a new challenge, this anxiety increases because you lack belief in yourself and worry that you might not be up to the challenge. Fear of failure and self-doubt drive this vicious cycle. The high standards that you set yourself as well as the negative voice that you use to motivate yourself are part of the problem. The imposter does not see that failure is a normal part of life… Imposter syndrome is highly common in work settings where competition is encouraged, and work output is constantly scrutinised. It can also occur when you feel different from the core group, if for example, you are one of the few women in a male-dominated sector such as medicine or an ethnic minority who does not match the dominant group, causing you to feel illegitimate despite your qualifications and accomplishments.2 You may feel that you have a lot to live up to, and this can bring different expectations. You are representing not just yourself but a whole social group – if people have a negative view of your social group, this pressure is increased even more. It can also lead to thoughts such as only being there thanks to positive discrimination and cause you to dismiss your success, making you feel that you are not as good as your colleagues/friends. This is a mind trap that can affect you physically with bursts of adrenaline, increased heart rate, a creeping sense of dread, or general tension. These thoughts and sensations exacerbate the problem, adding to your feelings of inadequacy and clouding how you think. When you feel this way all the time, it leads to a terrifying existence, and even depression. Compassion is the key to overcoming imposter syndrome, acting like a mortar which holds everything together so you can confidently rebuild the bricks of who you are and how you operate. We have never really been taught to be kind to ourselves, to give ourselves positive self-motivation, encouragement, reassurance and the ability to take on board our achievements. There is a widely believed misconception that you need self-criticism to ensure that you do not become complacent and have learned to motivate yourself in this way. This negative internal monologue with yourself can make it harder to achieve your goals and puts you at a higher risk of stress and depression, making you less effective at implementing coping strategies. Rather than motivating you, speaking to yourself in a negative way all the time paves the way for anxiety and low self-esteem. By comparison, self-compassionate people are more resilient, bounce back more easily from setbacks, are more likely to learn from their mistakes, take steps to improve themselves and reach their potential. The perfectionist – You set excessively high standards for yourself and believe that you should deliver a perfect performance 100% of the time. Perfectionists have a very specific vision of what they want and a very precise plan to reach it-there is no room for a detour. When perfection is the aim, everything is always going to fall short, and success is seldom satisfying. The natural genius – You judge yourself on whether you got things right on your first try. For this group, true competence means having inherent competence and ability. They are often overly optimistic about how much they can get done in the time available and when progress is slower than expected, they feel disappointed in themselves. The soloist – You believe that to do well, you must be able to do things on your own, typically turning down help so you can prove your competence. If you need help, you see it as a sign of failure, which brings about feelings of shame and triggers imposter feelings. The expert –You need to know it all, and believe true competence means knowing absolutely everything. When experts do not know the answer to every single question, they blame themselves for being incompetent instead of acknowledging their skill gaps and learning as you go. The superwoman/man – You measure competence by how many tasks you can both juggle and excel in. If you fall short in any of your designated roles, you feel shame. You have an unrealistic view of how much is possible and are switched on all the time, unable to enjoy down time and non-achievement-based activities. Once you have identified your competence type, you must try practical strategies to overcome these imposter traits. First, put an end to avoidance through overworking. Stop telling yourself that when you get ‘there,’ you will make more time for friends, family, or fun. This is like an alternate reality-a place you need to be before you can start enjoying life. Your new approach should be to accept that this future life of satisfaction and contentment will never exist, allowing you to make room to live a daily life that fulfils you. This will let you live your life now. Set realistic weekly goals by incorporating time you need for eating, checking e-mails, and how much time you need for yourself. Work to a sustainable level and not a burnout-inducing level. Do not overload your diary, otherwise you are just running from one thing to the next, without being present in any of them. We have a limited time on Earth and need to focus our time on doing the very important and meaningful things.5 Be transparent about your other commitments and do not say yes to everything-avoid overcommitting. Second, adjust your standards. Admitting that you are not up to a certain task shows a higher degree of self-awareness. We continue learning throughout our lives and it is one of life's greatest gifts. Understand that it is impossible to know everything and the discomfort that comes from not knowing certain things are not a bad thing. This is a feeling that everyone experiences when stepping out of their comfort zone. Reframe it being aware of these fears means you can maintain your curiosity and evolve by learning more, questioning and growing, and this is what helps us thrive. If you are a student, intern or apprentice, think of what these titles mean-you are not a professor but a trainee who is on a journey to learn and progress-not someone who is expected to know everything. Third, have a daily approach to caring for your mind, combat anxiety and low mood. Stop thinking that looking after your mental health needs a big change, such as taking a holiday, spending a day at a spa or moving to a different location away from your responsibilities. A daily approach makes a difference: happiness is linked to our intentional every-day activities and is not a destination we reach after doing certain things. To regain control, you need to remember that feelings pass; anxiety is normal; it is your body preparing you for what is ahead, helping you concentrate and sharpen the mind. It is a sign that you are outside your comfort zone and not a sign that you are not good enough. Anxiety does not feel pleasant but is not infinite, so remember that feelings are like clouds-they are not permanent and will pass to allow the Sun to break through. Although we prefer the good feelings, experiencing the full range of emotions is important and what makes us human. When you have darker feelings, remember that they do not necessarily reflect how things are. Use the mind-body link, using breathing techniques or exercise to reduce cortisol levels in your body. Uncertainty feeds anxiety, so increase your tolerance to uncertainty by reminding yourself that uncertainty is not something bad, just something that you do not yet know the answer. Fourth, get used to saying what you think! Stop worrying about saying the wrong thing. Tell people your opinion, speak up, question the status quo-differing options are vital for the growth of an organisation into fruition. Do not hide behind an apology when you do speak up as this shows you think of yourself as inferior. It is also important to avoid making comparisons. Do not make assumptions about others that are not true, such as them being inherently clever, never doubting themselves, or that they are managing everything. This way of comparing is unfair as it means we hold up the best parts we see in other people, cherry-picking from parts of their life and not seeing the whole picture. From this we invent a way of being that we should follow, which can leave us feeling that we are not good enough. Be aware of comparing what you feel on the inside with what people show on the outside. Often the image we portray is very different from what we feel inside. Remember that no one has it together all the time. Social media can feed this, so make sure you surround yourself with people whose opinions you value, those who support you, and only connect with people who lift you up. Use other people's success as inspiration and motivation, not as ammunition to beat yourself up. If you are struggling to recognise your strengths, you could take the VIA institute’s free strength test, which gives you a breakdown of your top five signature strengths. Knowing and applying your highest character strengths is the key to developing self-worth.6 Ask at least 3 family members or friends to describe five of your top character strengths. This might make you cringe, but it is worth doing. Going through what those closest to you see to be your biggest strengths is a special moment which helps reinforce the aspects of yourself that you ignore. This process makes such a difference to self-belief, and usually there are overlapping themes which help to internalise and validate these qualities. Summarise your key strengths and skills. Then, make a note of all the reasons why you deserve your current position or a promotion. You can refer back to this when you feel anxious. Spend 5 minutes at the end of each day thinking about all the good things that happened that day, no matter how small. Keeping a journal or digital log of these creates a virtuous circle. Reflect on anything that is going well or that makes you smile and feel good: work, personal, or social. Take compliments on board; stop minimising achievements. Record your role in making things happen. Accept praise without giving excuses. Look back at your lists at the end of the week and give them the attention they deserve. Celebrate your accomplishments and reward yourself for doing well – this is a positive reimbursement. Too often, we move onto the next task without rewarding ourselves for what we have done. Being comfortable in your own skin means letting go of control and recognising that you cannot be responsible for how everything goes. The imposter is the vulnerable part of you, and it needs compassion and care. The more you build on these new ways of thinking and incorporate healthy coping strategies into your daily life, the easier it will be to hold onto this new view, allowing you to continue to flourish and build trust in yourself. Remember, life is an adventure not a race…and enjoy the ride! The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

      "abstract": "In the development of the majority of children, ritualistic behaviour may be seen as a normal phenomenon. In some children and adolescents, however, these rituals become time-consuming, interfering, irritating and annoying. The most common obsessions in both children and adults with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are related to a fear of dirt and contamination, fear of some terrible happening, and the fear of harming a loved one. The most common compulsions are washing fixations, checking behaviour and rituals (including mental rituals). Prevalence studies show that OCD in children and adolescents is far more common than previously thought. It is estimated that up to 2% of this population have symptoms fulfilling OCD criteria. The impact of early OCD onset can be profound, with long-term studies indicating that approximately 50% of these patients will also suffer from OCD in early adulthood. These patients tend to remain socially isolated, to have fewer relationships than their non-OCD peers, and have a tendency to remain within the family home during early adulthood. In addition, childhood OCD is associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders, in particular depression, anxiety and panic disorders, Tourette's syndrome and eating disorders. Treatment strategies for childhood OCD reflect those used in adult psychiatry. The most effective psychotherapeutic approach is based on cognitive-behavioural therapy with exposure and prevention. In contrast to pharmacotherapeutic agents without serotonin activity, the serotonin-specific antidepressants appear to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of OCD in children.",

For a child found to fall within the spectrum of autism, the category most applicable along that spectrum is an additional differential diagnostic issue. The lines of division are not clear, although DSM-IV provides some help. In general, the term pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) is more likely to be used when cognitive, communicative, and social skills are high relative to other children who are autistic. Some studies have shown that the clinical criterion most useful in separating the two categories is the degree of socialization and relatedness shown by the child. Children who display an active social interest, a degree of empathy, and a better ability to sustain interactions tend to be placed in the PDD category. If they have particularly strong language skills along with the milder socialization difficulties, Asperger disorder is likely to be diagnosed. For the child who has significant developmental delays in all areas, the primary differential diagnosis will be mental retardation without autism. Many children who are severely mentally retarded exhibit some of the behaviors seen in autism, such as stereotyped behaviors and perseveration, emotional lability, and self-injurious behavior.",

Our case is a 22-year-old female born of a consanguineous marriage, with the appearance of CDD symptoms in her fifth year of age following normal mental and physical development during her initial four years of life. Without any precipitating factor, she gradually lost her language abilities, social relational skills, affectionate behavior, adaptive capacities, peer play and meaningful interest in her surrounding, friends and family members over a period of 4 years, reaching a plateau in her ninth year of age. The unique special clinical symptom in this case is a seasonal total mutism, which after the beginning of her CDD symptoms is revealing every year covering the spring. As no additional physical or psychological change accompanies her total seasonal speech loss, it cannot be attributed to any mental condition known as having a seasonal pattern.

Most children manifest the early symptoms and are diagnosed between ages 18 months and 36 months; in many, diagnosis can be suspected as early as 10–12 months of age and in most by 24 months. Autism should be suspected when an infant does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age; does not speak one word by 16 months; does not combine two words by 2 years of age; does not respond to name; and loses language or social skills. Autistic disorder is classified as one of the pervasive developmental disorders according to the DSM–IV–TR; the others are Rett's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.",

      "abstract": "As described in the literature for many years, a sizable number of children with hyperactive-impulsive and combined subtypes/presentations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)—especially males—progress to more serious externalizing syndromes across development. Such outcomes include oppositional defiant disorder, conduct problems, delinquency, substance use disorders, and in some cases antisocial personality disorder, incarceration, and recidivism. This chapter summarizes a developmental model that emphasizes different contributions of <italic>trait impulsivity</italic>, a highly heritable, subcortically mediated vulnerability, versus <italic>emotion dysregulation</italic>, a highly socialized, cortically mediated vulnerability, to externalizing progression. According to this perspective, trait impulsivity confers vulnerability to all externalizing disorders, but this vulnerability is unlikely to progress beyond ADHD in protective environments. In contrast, for children who are reared under conditions of adversity—including poverty, family violence, deviant peer influences, and neighborhood violence/criminality—neurodevelopment of prefrontal cortex structure and function is compromised, resulting in failures to achieve age-expected gains in emotion regulation and other forms of executive control. For these children, subcortical vulnerabilities to trait impulsivity are amplified by deficient cortical modulation, which facilitates progression along the externalizing spectrum.",

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "title": "Mothers of schizophrenic patients: medical and psychological aspects of the problem",
      "abstract": "Thus, we can talk about the obvious mutual influence between a child with schizophrenia and his mother. On the one hand, it can be manifested in the form of the fact that a certain number of personal characteristics of the mother is accompanied by the formation of high rates of schizoid and neurotic child. Of course, the presence of a certain psychological type of mother (as the only reason) is not enough for the emergence and development of schizophrenia, but the subsequent development of the child’s personal disorders, as a borderline between the norm and pathology, can already be the ground for the development of the disease in the presence of other more significant causes (for example, hereditary). On the other hand, the disease of the child can be a significant stress factor for the mother, leading to the formation of her manifestations of emotional stress and psychological maladjustment, which, in turn, can adversely affect not only the features of her relationship with the child, but also on the features of the course of his disease. The mechanisms of formation of such a «vicious circle» are poorly studied even theoretically, not to mention the fact that in routine psychiatric practice these issues do not fall into the focus of the psychiatrist’s attention, are not taken into account in the development of therapy strategy. However, the parameters of interaction between mother and child, the level of their mutual empathy, can be important for the formation of compliance in the treatment of schizophrenia, as the «conductor» of therapy in relation to a small patient is the mother. There is also no doubt that the level of mental health of the mother is an important resource for maintaining the viability of the whole family system and, in particular, a necessary condition for the organization of adequate therapy for a child with schizophrenia. Therefore, the study of the issues of mutual influence of the patient with schizophrenia and his mother, the development of ways to correct the problems arising in this case are an important scientific and practical task of modern psychiatry.",

These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.",

      "title": "Developing family resilience in chronic psychiatric illnesses.",
      "abstract": "Caregiving for an ill family member can be both stressful and rewarding. Caring for a relative with a psychiatric illness adds the burden of social stigma, both for the patient and the family caregivers, especially in minority cultures. Families from minority cultures may have a different understanding of mental illness and have difficulties with language, discrimination, and accessing services. The appraisal of caregiving must be assessed separately from a caregiver’s coping style. For example, caregiving may be perceived as low stress but the caregiver’s coping skills may be poor, resulting in high caregiver burden. Low perceived stress with strong coping skills results in the most reward and the least burden. High levels of caregiver burden occur in caregivers of relatives with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and chronic or recurrent mood disorders. Caregiver burden tends to be worse and more persistent with relatives who suffer from depressive disorders compared to bipolar disorder. Children of caregivers may have difficult behavior, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, with less playing and less attention at school. Caregiver burden can be reduced and caregiver reward can be maximized by improving family resilience. The concept of family resilience explains why some families experience lower burden and greater reward. Family resilience includes the ability to develop adaptive interpersonal skills, such as differentiating the person from the illness, and positive family qualities, such as mutual acceptance and empathic involvement. These family strengths contribute to a sense of family wellnbeing and offset difficulties in other areas of family functioning. The wellbeing of the family unit ensures the best outcome for both patient and caregiver.",

Pandevelopmental retardation was significantly related to a genetic history for schizophrenia (&lt;.05), but not to obstetric complications. The severity of PDR was significantly related to the severity of later psychiatric and cognitive disorder (&lt;.01).

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of epilepsy is always a s0.urce of sh?ck to the family and is frequently accompamed by anXIety concerning the cause. In extreme cases the diagnosis can even lead to suicide. Parents feel guilty and search for reasons why this has happened to one of their children. Is it attributable to some defect in their family, such as an alcoholic uncle or a mentally disturbed relative, or to their own misdeeds? The mother may blame herself for trying to avoid pregnancy, or for an attempted termination, or just not wanting the child. Arising from these deeply-felt feelings and anxieties the child may be rejected or overprotected. . The child who has epilepsy will have to grow up ID an atmosphere of anxiety about his condition. Parents are concerned about their responsibility and how far they can allow the child to follow a normal existence. There may be disputes about this, and as to how far the child should be subject to the same discipline as the other children. The child may endure many restrictions (swimming, riding a bicycle, etc), limitations on activities or going out with other children. Drugs may have to be taken-a nuisance in itself-and he will suffer the effects of taking drugs even if these are minimal. There may be difficulty in keeping up with schooling, and in many ways he will feel different from other children. Later the inability to drive a car may be a social handicap. Epilepsy, to the individual, means a ~reat deal ~f uncertainty. Will a seizure interfere with taking an exan:nnation or an interview for a job, or plans for some social activity or a holiday? Epileptics may feel that the risk. of causing a disturbance at a cinema or a dance by havIDg a seizure is too embarrassing, and so they become more and more isolated. All these factors play a significant role in the development of the individual and his per~onality. There is no clear evidence that epilepsy itself causes behavioural disturbance. Occasionally the underlying cause of the seizure may be responsible for disturbed behaviour in a child or some cases of temporal lobe epilepsy cause behavioural disorders. The extremes of epileptic personalitv are more often the sort of behaviour which follows lo~g periods of institutional care and it is r~re ~o find someone demonstrating the old textbook epileptic personality outside of an institution.

Half of the subjects were diagnosed as passive aggressive personalities, schizoid personalities or presenting schizophrenic reactions, having in common a high degree of emotional vulnerability, dependence, inability to give rather than take, inability to assume responsibilities society imposes on the adult and a tendency to withdraw under increased stress. Similar features are present, underlying or associated with depression, in those diagnostic categories in which the depressive element plays a significant part—depressive reactions, manic-depressive reactions, cyclothymic personalities and emotionally unstable personalities. Based on Freud's ideas on civilization and its discontent, the chronic Skid Row alcoholic (who is liable to become a chronic drunkenness offender) is regarded as an individual whose passivity interferes to the highest degree with an adequate response to the frustrating experiences caused by the restrictions on the sex drive and the expression of aggression imposed by civilization. He is using two devices, intoxication and isolation, in his attempts to deal with his emotional and social predicament. These processes are facilitated by the conditions of his social level which makes these modes of adaptation more accessible than others.

It is the goal of this presentation to elaborate a borderline concept for use in daily clinical practise. First, development of the term over the preanalytical, analytical and empirical areas is summarized. Next, the term of borderline for clinical practise is developed on the basis of characteristics and the global picture. Characteristics are: intensive, instable behaviour in relations, reduced control of impulse, disturbed affection and mood, psychotic manifestations, instable social adaptation. Diagnosis is founded on exploration of characteristics and on seizing of the global picture. The combination with other psychiatric disorders and separation from other personality disorders have to be considered with respect to differential diagnosis. The descriptive diagnosis has to be complemented from a psychodynamic point of view. The borderline patient has in his psychologic development failed to segregate sufficiently from his primary reference person. This results in a structural deficit and a weak ego. This latter is characterized by deficient integration and deficient separation, by disturbed perception of reality and by a non-specific general weakness of the ego. Finally, difficulties arising in the relations between physician and borderline patient are outlined.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

      "title": "Psychosocial interventions for expressed emotion in bipolar affective disorder: A key to care",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is a complex severe mental disorder caused by interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors, often sensitive to changes in the environment.[1] Though pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, psychosocial interventions, especially focusing on expressed emotion (EE), helps with earlier recovery in BPAD.[2,3] This case report briefly illustrates the psychosocial model of treatment for EE and its impact on the outcome in a person with BPAD. A 24-year-old graduate, single, female, born of second-degree consanguineous marriage, with familial predisposition to affective illness and psychosis, presented with symptoms of elated mood, unprovoked irritability, increased talkativeness, unsolicited singing, wandering tendency, delusions of persecution, love, and grandiosity, along with auditory hallucinations. She presented with similar mood symptoms in the absence of psychotic symptoms in the past with irregular compliance to medication. She was diagnosed with BPAD, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms. She was started on antipsychotic medication and mood stabilizers, according to the prescribed guidelines. These symptoms were noticed to significantly affect her personal and social functioning in the form of self-care deficits and interpersonal difficulties at work and in the family. A detailed study of family interactions and dynamics revealed a male-dominated family, with the father as the head. The interaction between siblings and parents was adequate with substantial cohesiveness, problem-solving, and secondary social support. However, the course of the illness had taken significant toll over the existing family dynamics. The levels of EE in the family including perceived criticism and intensity of emotional over-involvement was assessed using Family Emotional Involvement and Criticism Scale.[4] As the EE was found to be high within the family and was found to be adversely affecting the recovery process of the patient,[5] it was decided to provide psychosocial interventions to reduce the EE in the family.[6] Family interventions were taken up in 3 sessions including psychoeducation regarding the biopsychosocial causes, course and prognosis of the illness, addressing the myths and misconceptions, identifying early signs, and symptoms of the episode, followed by family communication training in reducing negative interactions, one after the other, targeting to reduce the high EE. Subsequently, the caregivers were also engaged in 4 sessions of supportive therapy, where each family member was given the space to ventilate about their worries, with an aim to provide reassurance, clarifications, and guidance as needed. As higher relapse rates were observed when encountered with problems, the patient and caregivers were also assisted with problem-solving techniques such as identifying the problem, specifying it, choosing, implementing, and evaluating the best alternatives. As a part of vocational guidance, the patient was encouraged to seek an appropriate job and also engage in new hobbies, keeping the patient's strengths, and potentials in mind. Though the interventions had different foci and formats, they were all focused on encouraging the patient and the family to actively consort to the treatment. The EE was assessed in regular intervals and the result is presented in Table 1.Table 1: Scores of expressed emotion assessed using Family EmotionaCl Involvement and Criticism Scale in three time pointsEE is the critical, hostile, and emotionally over-involved attitude that caregivers have toward their patients with mental illness.[7,8] Psychosocial interventions, involving caregivers help reduce EE and improve understanding of illness and communication, paving way for better social functioning and treatment compliance, thereby improving the quality of life and prevent further relapse and rehospitalization. Hence, this case report reiterates the idea that psychosocial interventions targeting EE, enhances the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in promoting stabilization of illness, making it a key component in the holistic approach to BPAD.

      "abstract": "Hearing impairment is so often an invisible disability that it does not often enter the awareness of those whose senses are intact. A textbook knowledge of the physiology and pathology of hearing does not prepare the clinician to cope with a hearing-impaired family member, friend, or colleague, with whom we feel embarrassed, lest our raised voices attract too much attention. We are even less prepared to evaluate or treat hearing-impaired persons in the course of our professional activities. Yet hearing impairment is common, and the profoundly deaf probably suffer mental disorders at a rate in excess of that of their hearing peers. Profound deafness, the absence of functional or remediable hearing, is extremely disabling. Profound deafness that occurs prior to complete acquisition of verbal language is socially and psychiatrically devastating. , · Such deafness, also known as prelingual deafness, is believed to result in uneven, incomplete, or arrested personality developmentl· 4 and behavioral disturbances, S the understanding of which is complicated by the natural language barrier. Prelingually deaf offenders are said to have special problems within the criminal justice system,6-9 analogous in some respects to the diagnostic difficulties known to accompany such deafness. ' '2 At least since the late nineteenth century, commentators have questioned whether hearing impairment is associated with criminality. The legal status of the defendant has been coupled with that of the mentally disordered for centuries.

In this article, we touch upon the historical legal status of the deaf-mute defendant, present data on a study of deaf defendants admitted to a maximum security psychiatric facility, and review studies exploring possible relationships between hearing impairment and adult criminality and between hearing impairment and juvenile delinquency.

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Apathy in endogenous depressions is a complex mental phenomenon (it is characterized by indifference and loss of interests, reduced incentives and motivation, decreased mental and physical activity). Apathy becomes the cause of pronounced social maladaptation and untimely seeking medical help. Different depressions vary in psychopathological features of apathy, in addition, there are also different dimensions of the general dynamics of endogenous disease. Objectives Study of the features of the course of schizophrenia, in which apathetic depressions develop with episodic and persistent type of dynamics Methods The study included 36 patients (15 men, 21 women, average age 34.9 years) with schizophrenia. In 17 cases, apathetic depressions occurred as short-term episodes, in 19 cases, depression took a persistent (close to chronic) course. Results Schizophrenia with an episodic type of dynamics of apathetic depressions was characterized by: the predominance of cases with early onset of the disease; alternation of apathetic and other type depressions; equal occurrence of mono- and bipolar types of desease; low severity of negative symptoms and slight changes in social and labor functioning. Apathy has always been present during the whole lenght of depression, its picture was dominated by a motivational decline. The studied cases were prognostically favorable. The features of the course of schizophrenia with chronic apathetic depression were: hyperthymic (10 out of 19 observations) and sensitive schizoid (6 out of 19 observations) premorbid personality; bipolar forms of the disease (94.7%, p &lt; 0.05); the predominance of apathetic depression over other depression types, atypical form of depression; short duration of remissions; frequent course of the disease with the presence of only apathetic depressions (12 out of 19, 63.1%, p &lt; 0.05); significant severity of negative symptoms. Apathy occupied only as a part of the duration of the state, as a rule, after anxiety depression. The picture of apathy was dominated by a decrease in initiative or motivation. This clinical group is the most prognostically unfavorable. Conclusions Schizophrenia, occurring with the presence of persistent forms of apathetic depression, has a greater impact on the functioning of patients and has a less favorable prognosis.

The present study assessed 114 psychiatric inpatients categorized according to the presence or absence of social loss and their level of emotional reliance on others. Both emotional reliance and social loss were related to a variety of depressive symptoms. A significant interaction was observed between emotional reliance and social loss on depression severity as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In general, subjects high in emotional reliance but experiencing no social loss displayed higher levels of depression than emotionally reliant subjects who had undergone a social loss. Patients reporting high emotional reliance on others, in the aftermath of a social loss, may be reacting to the loss and suffer from less-severe and less-chronic pathology. Subjects reporting excessive emotional reliance in the absence of any precipitating exit event may be displaying more of a trait-like pathology. Personality disorder pathology should occur with such frequency and intensity so it can be observed even when obvious eliciting stimuli are absent.",

Early recognition of potentially dangerous situations is the most efficient way to avoid violence. We stress out that not any act of violence is associated with mental disorder, it often can be found in individuals considered as normal in tensed or frustrating situations. The concept of aggressiveness has a broader scope than violence; in a narrower sense it refers to a person that attacks with a sudden and unexpected brutality. In a broader sense it includes all heteroaggressive or self-destructive tendencies. In the emergency department, the physician may frequently encounter agitated and/or violent patients. It is necessary to determine whether there is immediate risk of danger. Aggressive behavior can be recognized by identifying several factors such as: [1]  the presence of a primary psychiatric disorder (schizophrenia, manic episodes in a bipolar affective disorder, dementia of various etiologies, personality disorders) or a secondary mental disorder (alcohol and/or drugs intoxication, adverse effects of improper or excessive use of medication for somatic background)",

      "title": "Does Bipolar Disorder Exist in Children? A Selected Review",
      "abstract": "Although there is increasing recognition that a substantial proportion of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) experience an onset of illness in adolescence, significant controversy remains over the validity of the diagnosis in very young children. In careful studies of adult patients dating from Kraepelin, first mood episodes not uncommonly occurred during adolescence. Some of these early-onset patients experienced subthreshold mood disturbances or predisposing temperaments earlier in childhood. Earlier onsets of BD have been reported in more recent clinical and community samples of children. Several factors possibly contributed to these earlier onsets, including exposure to psychotropics, bias in favour of a mood rather than a psychotic diagnosis, and recognition of softer-spectrum BDs. However, the validity of the diagnosis of BD in impulsive, irritable, labile, or behaviourally dysregulated children remains to be proven. Studies of high-risk children of well-characterized parents with BD have demonstrated that BD most often debuts as a depressive episode in mid to late adolescence and that activated episodes are rare prior to age 12 years. Some children manifest antecedent nonspecific psychopathology in early childhood. Therefore, as currently diagnosed, BD does not manifest as such typically until at least adolescence.",

      "abstract": "1. The goal of dynamic psychotherapy with schizophrenics is the same as that of intensive psychotherapy with other mental disturbances, i. e. to help both ambulatory and hospitalized patients gain awareness of and curative insight into the history and unknown dynamic causes which are responsible for their disorder. 2. The same type of psychotherapeutic approach to schizophrenic patients during all phases and manifestations of the disorder and discussions of illness and treatment after their recovery are recommended for the purpose of helping such patients to integrate their recovery with their psychotic past. 3. An attempt is made to understand schizophrenic symptomatology and to approach it therapeutically as an expression of and as a defense against anxiety. The hypothesis is offered that the universal human experience of tension between dependency, fear of relinquishing it, recoil from it, and interpersonal hostility becomes, in the case of schizophrenic persons, so highly magnified and so overwhelming that it leads to unbearable degrees of anxiety and then to discharge in symptom-formation. 4. The multiple meaning of many schizophrenic symptoms, communications, and other manifestations has been discussed. The need for understanding and translating them descriptively for therapeutic reasons has been questioned, and the significance of nonverbal communications with schizophrenic patients has been stressed. 5. Psychodynamic investigation and clarification of schizophrenic anxiety and symptomatology in its conscious and unconscious manifestations in the patient-psychiatrist relationship is presented to be equally as crucial for the psychotherapy with schizophrenics as for other mental patients.",

      "abstract": "Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is a severe mental disease that brings about serious difficulties and impairments in the lives of those affected by it. Those with SPD might be described as strange or unusual by other people. They are highly likely to have few intimate or close relationships. The purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss the etiology, individual and social impact, prognosis, and treatments for SPD. These details are important to study because SPD has been reported to be linked to violent behavior. A review of pertinent literature, mostly peer-reviewed journal articles, is carried out. The findings show that SPD has no known specific cause(s), results in severe physical, psychological, and social disabilities, and does not have any specific treatment. Further research on psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments is needed to improve prognosis for SPD, especially as regards its connection to violent behavior. Additional studies are also needed to conclusively identify SPD in all ages, which would help more effectively tailor psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions to the specific symptoms being presented.",

      "abstract": "Autism is now a very common condition, and some degree of autism symptoms frequently are found in individuals who have ADHD. Sometimes, these symptoms can be masked by more overt ADHD symptoms, and not recognized. Therefore to understand the spectrum of conditions associated with ADHD, it is necessary to have an understanding of autism. When individuals with ADHD are not responding as expected to usually effective treatments, especially with additional symptoms such as oppositional and aggressive behaviors, argumentative or social skills difficulties, unrecognized co-occurring autism should be considered. The autism spectrum is very broad, and individuals with autism may present with severe speech delay, intellectual disability, behavioral meltdowns and social isolation when toddlers, or may have milder learning and speech difficulties with sensory and social skills difficulties recognized in grade school, or may be very high functioning with exceptional skills in areas of interest, but struggling with subtler social skills deficits and interactions. Anxiety is almost universal in those with autism. Treatment is usually multimodal, involving potentially speech therapy with social skills training, occupational therapy, psychotherapy, medication directed at specific conditions or symptoms, and sometimes more intensive ABA therapy.",

In this study, 12 cases of DD were blindly rediagnosed from a cohort of 146 schizophrenics. The prevalence of schizophrenia in the relatives of the DD probands was significantly less than that found in the relatives of the schizophrenics. Affective illness was equally uncommon in both groups of relatives. Inferiority feelings clustered significantly in the relatives of the DD probands. From a familial perspective, DD is not closely related to schizophrenia or affective illness but does have a familial link to inferiority feelings.

      "abstract": "Introduction Although catatonia was conceptualized as a subtype of schizophrenia, it is now recognized to occur most commonly in the course of other psychiatric disorders, in drug-induced disorders [1] or neurologic conditions [2]. Catatonia is rarely seen together with OCD and there are a limited number of case reports in the literature [3,4]. Objective We describe the case of a 12 year boy who presented in our clinic with mutism, negativism, immobility, social withdrawn, rigid posture, refusal to eat. Method We performed a thorough psychiatric diagnostic assessment of the child as well as laboratory tests and MRI of the brain. Results The child's first symptoms appeared 2 years ago: initially the child became socially withdrawn, spent most of time at his room, and became preoccupied with rituals of hand washing, walking back and forth, preoccupations with food contamination, became aggressive if someone would interrupt what he was doing, stopped going at school, and stopped calling his parents “mother” or “father”. Brain MRI showed lateral ventricular asymmetry and suboccipital cyst. Conclusions The child was put on therapy with lorazepam and sertraline. His obsessive-compulsive symptoms improved, and the apparent catatonic like features resolved and did not return over follow-up. Discussion Catatonia is not uncommon among children and adolescents, and the relationship between OCD and catatonia is still misunderstood, but it may be an indicator of the severity of the OCD.

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "espanolSe describe la evolucion de las diferentes formas de angustia de una paciente (P) con ataques de panico, durante los siete anos del proceso psicoanalitico. Se considera inicialmente a P como con una organizacion fronteriza de la personalidad. Ella vivia su adolescencia alterada con predominio de la posicion esquizoparanoide; padecia de narcisismo patologico; sufria de agorafobia, ataques de panico y somatizaciones como consecuencia, principalmente, de una insufi ciente separacion-individuacion y de una simbiosis patologica con su madre primitiva. Su angustia de separacion, que inducia a veces ataques de panico y somatizaciones, se re-actualizaba repetitivamente en transferencia y se elaboro durante los primeros anos. Esos y otros sintomas disminuyeron su intensidad paulatinamente, y luego desaparecieron o dejaron de ser una preocupacion. Con el proposito de buscar convergencias, suplementos y divergencias en las teorias, se revisan las conceptualizaciones construidas sobre las diferentes formas de angustias. Las de P corresponden mas a las pre-edipicas que a las de las posiciones posteriores. Varias formas de angustia se relacionan con re-vivencias traumaticas o se producen por anticiparlas y, eventualmente, para evitar estas vivencias desbordantes. Efectivamente, P no ha vivido solamente una separacion traumatica de su madre cuando tenia seis anos, sino que se infi ere haber padecido tambien traumas negativos y acumulativos. Esas vivencias traumaticas no le habian permitido la construccion de un self sufi cientemente cohesivo ni una separacion-individuacion sufi ciente que le permitieran elaborar su adolescencia. Entonces P vivia en angustias permanentes que le precipitaban facilmente en ataques de panico y somatizaciones ante las situaciones de separacion de su madre primitiva-analista. Su angustia de separacion y sus ataques de panico eran tambien los factores de su angustia de muerte y de su insomnio. EnglishThe evolution of the different forms of anxiety of a patient (P) with panic attacks is described during seven years of the psychoanalytic process. The P is considered initially like a borderline organization of the personality. She was living her adolescence altered with predominance of the schizoparanoid position; was suffering of pathological narcissism, agoraphobia, panic attacks and somatisations as consequences, mainly, of an insuffi cient separation-individuation and a pathological symbiosis with her primitive mother. Her anxieties of separation that was inducing, sometimes, panic attacks and somatisations, were reedited repetitively in transference and were elaborated during the fi rst years. Those and other symptoms diminished gradually of intensity, and disappeared or they stopped being a preoccupation. In order to look for convergences, supplementations and divergences in the theories, are reviewed the conceptualisations constructed on the different forms of anxiety. The anxieties of P correspond more to the pre-oedipus anxieties that to those of the later positions. Several forms of anxieties are related to reliving traumatic experiences or they take place to anticipate them and to possibly avoid these overfl owing experiences. Indeed, the P has not only lived one traumatic separation from her mother when she was six years old, but it is inferred that she has also suffered negative and cumulative traumas. Those traumatic experiences had not allowed to the construction of a self suffi ciently cohesive nor a suffi cient separation-individuation that could allow the elaboration of her adolescence. Then the P was living in permanent anxiety that was precipitating easily her panic attacks and somatisations in the presence of the situations of separation of her mother primitive-analyst. Her anxiety of separation and her panic attacks were also the factors of her anxiety of death and insomnia.",

      "title": "Cognitive disturbances in schizophrenics: What are they, and what is their origin?",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT— Cognitive disorders are neither a unique nor a constant phenomenon in schizophrenia. Among the dysfunctions that may be observed at times, primarily during acute phases and in patients with a non‐paranoid symptomatology, certain disturbances in attention‐focusing and information processing seem to be most conspicuous. Some of these cognitive dysfunctions may have been transmitted from parent(s) to the patient, either genetically or through simple forms of learning. The empirical evidence for this assumption is to be found in the fact that some of the same cognitive deficits as those found in schizophrenic patients are also found in their first‐degree relatives, although usually in a milder form. Other forms of cognitive dysfunction may have developed as complementary strategies in response to communication deviances and cognitive behavior found in their parents. A developmental model, in which genetic, physiological and environmental factors are included is described as a way of illustrating how predisposing factors, as well as intermediating and stress factors, contribute to the debut and maintenance of cognitive disorders in schizophrenics.",

The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in children does not reflect static disease entities, usually, but rather either diseases in process, which become evident in their final state in adulthood, or other social and cultural factors, such as abuse, trauma, and neglect. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states. Long-term randomized data with amphetamines indicate no greater functional benefit than with psychosocial interventions for ADD. Notable harms exist, including stunted height and possible neurotoxicity.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a disruptive behavior disorder characterized by a pattern of angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting for at least six months. Children and adolescents with ODD may have trouble controlling their temper and are often disobedient and defiant toward others. There are no tools specifically designed for diagnosing ODD, but multiple questionnaires can aid in diagnosis while assessing for other psychiatric conditions. ODD is often comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and mood disorders, including anxiety and depression. Behavioral therapy for the child and family members improves symptoms of ODD. Medications are not recommended as first-line treatment for ODD; however, treatment of comorbid mental health conditions with medications often improves ODD symptoms. Adults and adolescents with a history of ODD have a greater than 90% chance of being diagnosed with another mental illness in their lifetime. They are at high risk of developing social and emotional problems as adults, including suicide and substance use disorders. Early intervention seeks to prevent the development of conduct disorder, substance abuse, and delinquency that can cause lifelong social, occupational, and academic impairments.",

The core of this theory is that without emotional validation or mirroring in early life, children with ADHD internalize misattuned moments as evidence of personal failure. These early, misunderstood emotions become permanently imprinted, reactivated later in life through seemingly small moments of criticism, failure, or rejection. The inability to understand or express these experiences outwardly leads to devastating long-term effects in adulthood, including self-sabotage, emotional collapse, and identity distortion",

One of the difficulties in recognizing pathological depression is that it often arises insidiously, and so goes unrecognized by both the patient and family. A number of risk factors for mental distress and depression have been proposed in the medical literature from Arab countries, including low socio economic status, a large number of children in the home, and lower self-efficacy. Studies have consistently shown a high prevalence of depression and psychosocial distress in the Arab world, the available evidence does not indicate a correspondingly high incidence of suicide. As a society moves towards an individualist model and away from mechanisms that provide close interpersonal contact and intense social support, psychological distress escalates to self-harm behaviors. The clinician should explore the patient's thoughts of possible self-harm whenever a patient is encountered who seems to be hopeless, or expresses feelings of helplessness.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, affective/emotional disorders and exposure to adverse life circumstances are the main sources of psychological impairment in school age children. They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

Some conditions that have been traditionally regarded as schizophrenia, seem to have overlapping parts with those of PDD. An example of them is schizophrenia--like symptoms observed occasionally in individuals with PDD. The relationship of the two disorders remains to be investigated. I present a case of an adolescent with early symptoms of schizophrenia, in whom there seems to have been PDD symptoms in his early childhood. The issue of the differential diagnosis of the two disorders is discussed on the basis of the case. It is sometimes difficult to diagnose PDD in mildest cases in adolescence or adulthood, presumably because they show subtle symptoms in their early childhood in terms of interpersonal relationships and caretakers of them are likely to fail to recognize their problems, which may cause difficulty in sufficient collection of information about their early childhood.",

Elective mutism is a very debilitating disorder for the affected child, as well as for their families, with detrimental implications for the development of social skills and learning if not offered appropriate support and treatment. The most promising treatment results have thus by far been achieved through a combination of cognitive behaviour therapy and supportive cooperation between parents, the school, and the treating child psychiatrist, occasionally supplemented with pharmacological treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The available literature on this disorder is still very limited and consists predominantly of case reports. In recent years, however, there has been a growing focus on the etiology and general understanding of the disorder. While still disputed, it has been suggested that elective mutism might be understood as an emotional disorder on a par with e.g. separation anxiety and social phobia. Studies looking at the long-term course of the disorder are urgently required to elucidate whether children presenting elective mutism will be more likely to suffer from emotional disorders in adulthood, and may also ultimately lead to improved treatments for this disabling psychiatric disorder of childhood.",

Conversely, many with ASD (particularly those formerly diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome) have superior technical skills. It has been hypothesized that the brains of individuals with ASD are skewed to maleness, possibly linked to genomic imprinting of paternal genes.

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "title": "Reacting to Demoralization and Investigating the Experience of Dignity in Psychosis: Reflections from an Acute Psychiatric Ward",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychotic disorders are extremely challenging for individuals and their loved ones. The experience of psychosis, as is found in schizophrenia, may subvert the foundations of the individual’s relationship with the world. Irrespective of the theoretical frame of reference, psychotic episodes are characterized by intrinsic impairment of the individual ability to know, make sense of, and experience the world, thus limiting agency and threatening dignity. In addition, individuals with acute psychosis are generally cared for within institutions that entail some degree of separation from society (e.g. the psychiatric ward) and—in extreme cases—with coercive practices. Coercion is established by the law as a “necessary evil” to avoid risky outcomes and to achieve clinical improvements, i.e. recover a better contact with reality. However, this approach may engender situations that are detrimental for individual dignity, morale, and epistemic justice. During the emergence of acute severe mental illness and its treatment, individuals may in fact encounter stigmatization and marginalization, and experience stress, loss of agency and loss of dignity. After one or more hospital admissions, the experience of severe mental illness and the conditions related to treatment may engender demoralization, which is particularly detrimental in the long term and may increase the risk of suicide. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the available evidence on these topics and broad indications on strategies and therapeutic approaches that might improve the experience of psychiatric inpatient care.",

However, schizophrenics differed from the other diagnostic groups on four measures: they showed significantly more oculomotor, stereognosis, and right-left identification abnormalities and more errors of omission on the attentional task under distraction conditions. The findings of this study are consistent with earlier reports that schizoaffectives are not greatly different from patients with other affective disorders in family history, treatment response, or long-term outcome. There is not yet sufficient etiologic or behavioral evidence to indicate that schizoaffective disorder is a valid diagnostic category.",

      "title": "Identifying a Treatable Psychosis-Risk Cohort",
      "abstract": "Detection and intervention in the very early phases of psychosis is possibly the field of schizophrenia’s best hope for substantive improvements in the outcome of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Huge progress has been made in many mental health systems worldwide, offering specialized intervention programs for people experiencing first-episode psychosis (FEP).1 During the past decade a wide range of research and clinical work has explored the possibility of intervention before the onset of the full disorder.2 This work focuses on the pre-psychotic or prodromal stage of the illness, which has been defined as the period marked by changes from a person’s premorbid mental state and level of functioning up to the appearance of psychotic features.3 About 80% to 90% of people with schizophrenia describe various subthreshold symptoms in the months and years preceding psychosis, including changes in drive, perception, beliefs, attention, concentration, mood, affect, and behaviour.4 It is possible that much of the disability associated with schizophrenia develops during the prodromal period, in which poor social functioning and the beginning of negative symptoms form the foundation on which psychosis later develops.\r\n\r\nFrom retrospective studies,5 it seems as if most people with schizophrenia retrospectively report a prodromal period characterized by increasing problems in thinking, feeling, and behaving, but it is unclear how many people who may experience similar prodromal type symptoms will go on to develop a psychotic illness. Therefore, what is most important for early intervention would be to accurately identify people who may be at true risk of developing a psychotic illness. As the prodrome is essentially a retrospective concept, young people who are seen as being at risk for psychosis have been described as ultra-high risk or at clinical high risk because, as will be described in the first In Review paper in this issue,6 they are considered to be at high risk of developing psychosis based on clinical features.\r\n\r\nDr Alison R Yung and Dr Barnaby Nelson,6 from the University of Melbourne, review the efforts of researchers in Australia, North America, and Europe to develop and test operational criteria for prospectively assessing the risk for psychosis and suggest that it is possible to reliably identify an at-risk mental state in which people have an increased risk—for example, 25% to 35%—of developing a diagnosable psychotic illness during several years.7 These young people are generally help-seeking adolescents or young adults, and have many other concerns. Comorbid diagnoses, in particular, anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, are common. Impairment in social, role, and cognitive functioning, intermediate in severity to people with a psychotic illness and healthy control subjects, has been observed.8 It is these clinical concerns that form the basis for studies attempting to determine the predictors of psychosis. Results typically suggest that poor functioning, attenuated psychotic symptoms (such as unusual thought content and suspiciousness), substance misuse, and genetic high risk are among the common predictors.7,9\r\n\r\nSome research groups have begun to study biological markers that may predict psychosis. There is growing awareness that measures of brain anatomy and function may represent vulnerability markers for increased psychosis risk.10–12 As described in the second In Review paper in this issue13 there has been an explosion of neuroimaging data. In their review, Dr Stephen J Wood and colleagues,13 from the University of Birmingham, put all the exciting new findings into perspective, both in terms of prediction of psychosis and where the area needs to go. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis functioning in people at clinical high risk has also been explored, using salivary cortisol measures to assess HPA axis integrity. Clinical high-risk people who eventually developed psychosis exhibited higher cortisol levels at several follow-up points prior to conversion, compared with those that did not.14\r\n\r\nAs our data has grown regarding the predictive validity of clinical high-risk criteria, and the range of impairments and difficulties these young people experience, research has moved from early identification to preemptive intervention. The goal of these studies reviewed by Yung and Nelson in this issue6 was to reduce symptoms and behavioural deficits associated with this stage of illness, and to prevent or delay the onset of the FEP.\r\n\r\nWhat next? There are several obvious steps. The first is that the field of psychosis needs to move toward improved prediction models, specifically adding biomarkers as to the clinical predictors. Such models, although they will ideally improve our understanding of psychosis, will require translation to make them clinically useful.2 The second is advancing our work in testing treatments for this population to have treatments that are specifically designed for them, and that may have some basis in established risk factors.2\r\n\r\nWork on innovative treatments that not only address current concerns but also are preventive are much needed. Other important areas for the future is the growing concern that many young people who appear to be in the prodromal phase of a psychotic illness do not actually develop the illness but could not be described as healthy young people.8 This may be a concern that needs addressing in conjunction with recent advances in studying youth mental health and risk for mental health problems in general.15 Finally, as presented in the Yung and Nelson paper,6 there is a wealth of research exploring the existence of psychotic like experiences in the general population that has implications for this high-risk research as well as schizophrenia research.",

      "title": "Attention deficit and hyperkinetic disorders in childhood and adolescence",
      "abstract": "Abstract The concept of ADHD arose from neurological formulations, but does not entail them, and the modern definition simply describes a set of behavioural traits. The historical evolution of the concept was described by Schachar. It began with the idea that some behavioural problems in children arose, not from social and familial adversity, but from subtle changes in brain development. The term ‘minimal brain dysfunction (MBD)’ was often applied, and covered not only disorganized and disruptive behaviour but other developmental problems (such as dyspraxias and language delays) presumed to have an unknown physical cause. MBD, however, stopped being a useful description when studies of children with definite and more-than-minimal brain damage made it plain that they showed a very wide range of psychological impairment, not a characteristic pattern (see Harris, this volume); and therefore it was invalid to infer the presence of brain disorder from the nature of the psychological presentation. The successor to the concept of MBD was attention deficit and hyperactivity: defined, observable behaviour traits without assumption of cause. ‘Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder’ (ADHD) in DSM-IV, and ‘Hyperkinetic Disorder’ in ICD-10, describe a constellation of overactivity, impulsivity and inattentiveness. These core problems often coexist with other difficulties of learning, behaviour or mental life, and the coexistent problems may dominate the presentation. This coexistence, to the psychopathologist, emphasizes the multifaceted nature of the disorder; to the sociologist, a doubt about whether it should be seen as a disorder at all; to the developmentalist, the shifting and context-dependent nature of childhood traits. For clinicians, ADHD symptoms usually need to be disentangled from a complex web of problems. It is worthwhile to do so because of the strong developmental impact of ADHD and the existence of effective treatments. Public controversy continues, but professional practice in most countries makes ADHD one of the most commonly diagnosed problems of child mental health.",

Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga.

The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

The lines of division are not clear, although DSM-IV provides some help. In general, the term pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) is more likely to be used when cognitive, communicative, and social skills are high relative to other children who are autistic. Some studies have shown that the clinical criterion most useful in separating the two categories is the degree of socialization and relatedness shown by the child. Children who display an active social interest, a degree of empathy, and a better ability to sustain interactions tend to be placed in the PDD category. If they have particularly strong language skills along with the milder socialization difficulties, Asperger disorder is likely to be diagnosed.For the child who has significant developmental delays in all areas, the primary differential diagnosis will be mental retardation without autism. Many children who are severely mentally retarded exhibit some of the behaviors seen in autism, such as stereotyped behaviors and perseveration, emotional lability, and self-injurious behavior.",

Sexual dysfunction (SD) may be primarily due to physical disorders, including endocrinologic (diabetes, androgen deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), cardiovascular and pelvic illnesses. SD can be secondary or indirectly related to impairments of the physical disorder such as fatigue, weakness and bladder incontinence, or to the psychosocial stress of the illness. Not only the disease itself, but the treatment prescribed, may also cause sexual impairment. SD is prevalent among psychiatric patients and maybe related to both the psychopathology and the psychopharmacology. SD has been reported in as many as 30%-60% of patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotic medication, up to 78% of individuals with depression treated with antidepressants and up to 80% in patients suffering from anxiety disorder. Eating disorders and personality disorders, mainly borderline personality disorder, are also associated with SD. Psychosocial factors, like interpersonal relationships, length of relationship, lifestyle, socioeconomic class and cultural background have been shown to correlate with SD, especially in hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women. An evaluation of SD should take into consideration the primary sexual functioning, the physical and mental disorders, the various medications and the psychosocial factors. It is recommended to identify the specific cause of the SD and to treat the patient according to the individual's mental disorder, physical disorder and interpersonal relationship.",

      "title": "Psychological Management of Multiple Sclerosis An Overview",
      "abstract": "Eight case histories demonstrate features of the predisposing childhood background met with in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) together with the passive dependent coping mechanisms adopted by the child to ensure short-term survival, but which perpetuated into adult life are inadequate and somatically damaging. First, there is pathological dependence on a parental key figure later transferred wholly or partly to other key figures. The pathological dependence leads to ambivalence over separation from the key figure(s) and the attainment of an independent emotional existence. The childhood of MS patients is overwhelming because it is either turbulent or excessively cloying, and the child's response passive and docile. Other siblings, for reasons such as position in the sibship, or their sex, or inherited toughness, escape the full rigour of parental dominance, or successfully rebel against it. MS subjects are thus especially vulnerable to threats of illness, death or irretrievable severance from key figures but, while detachment is perilous, they also fear and resent engulfment and the loss of any small measure of identity they may have gained. With their infantile attempts at separation at age of 2–3 frustrated, or too feeble for success, and having learned the 'giving-up' response as their only defence against what they see as hopeless odds, it is hardly surprising that bids for independence at adolescence are equally unsuccessful. They often recall a few attempts at adolescent rebellion painfully and quickly put down by the threat of withdrawal by the key figure. Often these adolescent or adult attempts at independence are associated with sexual relationships bedevilled by guilt from early libidinous fantasies, and fears of being trapped into parenthood and responsibility thereby threatening their own position as the dependent child. It is, therefore, no accident that the onset and relapses of MS are commonly associated with the crises courtship, marriage and birth. The women, if they are childless, which is often the case because of their own hang-ups, not infrequently fantasise their sisters' or friends' babies as their own. Because of their superficial affability, men and women are vulnerable to the trauma of being made unwilling confidants especially in the sexual misdemeanours of their neighbours, friends, parents, siblings, children and grandchildren, and identify closely with injured parties; such experiences are frequently provocative of onset nd relapse of MS. MS patients conceal emotions, particularly aggressive emotions, behind a mask. The mask they wear is either smiling, or 1 Based on a paper read to the Society for Psychosomatic Research, London 1976. Paulley 27 unsmiling and flat. The flat mask may incorrectly be interpreted as depression. The moria seen with the brain damage of GPI parallels the gross euphoria of advanced cases of MS, but both are caricatures of the basic mood antedating the disease. Relatives and friends as well as the patient will confirm that the smiling or unsmiling mask is premorbid and an early learned defence to conceal real feelings too dangerous to reveal. In this series there is a predominance of eldest and youngest children, and the histories reveal that they are often the most exposed to the damaging factors mentioned. However, the figures are just below the level of statistical significance. Likewise, the number of only children seemed to be more than one would expect. Psychotherapy is directed to helping these patients in the therapeutic situation to show their feelings, sometimes for the first time in their lives, and bring into consciousness their unconscious habit of hiding more intense feelings behind a smiling or unsmiling mask, and then to learn to lower their defensive mask, not only in the therapeutic situation, but later in their interpersonal relationships. Of necessity this programme also involves helping the patient wherever possible to separate emotionally from his key figure and surrogates. Experience has shown that this is more effectively and rapidly achieved by couple therapy in which the spouse or fiancé(e) affords an empathetic extension of the therapeutic situation beyond the consulting room. It is necessary to maintain therapy over the dangerous period during which dependence becomes attenuated first by substitution of the therapist for the key figure and later by incorporation of the 'good parent' and extrusion of the 'bad'. Subsequently, the link with the therapist may be weakened by spaced interviews but with easy access to the therapist in the event of relapse. Successful psychotherapy is punctuated by substantial remissions of the somatic symptoms of MS.

      "abstract": "Throughout history, various changes and ways of referring have given to this mental illness now known as schizophrenia. There is still no concrete explanation as to the onset of the disorder; it is considered that their presence tends to be more common in men than in women. Between possible triggers for schizophrenia it noted age of onset and genetic factors. The genetic risk for the disorder is not enough because approximately 60% of people with schizophrenia have no family history whatsoever. The environment unlike this factor demonstrates a higher weight. Classically they have divided into positive and negative symptoms. It must be remembered that not in all cases the same combination of symptoms occur as it is considered to schizophrenia as a heterogeneous disorder. The decrease in attention, memory or disturbances in executive functioning are also symptoms called cognitives, which can get to add to the traditional division of existing symptoms. These symptoms and signs should be continued for at least 6 months of persistence. To continue with the diagnosis, have to remember that persistence is the key to the process of psychological evaluation, and in this case that presents psychotic symptoms is recommended a regular contact with the patient.",

      "abstract": "There is considerable controversy about the classification of the late-onset non-affective psychoses, and their relationship to \"typical\" early-onset schizophrenia. Many authors consider late-onset schizophrenia to be \"a form of schizophrenia, albeit attenuated and modified\". One suggestion is that inherent genetic vulnerability, itself insufficient to cause psychosis, acts in consort with environmental factors (social isolation, sensory impairment, non-specific brain atrophy) to precipitate delusional breakdown. Alternatively, the late-onset schizophrenia-like states could be considered as comprising one or more subtypes, relatively distinct from early-onset schizophrenia. Our own view is conditioned by our belief that early-onset schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose origins lie in faulty brain development in foetal or neonatal life.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reviews the characteristics, symptomology, diagnosis, epidemiological, biopsychosocial, genetic, pharmacological, psychotherapeutic aspects of treating patients with Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) who are in the Cluster B (dramatic/emotional) subset of personality disorders. HPD is marked by flamboyant, shallow, dysregulated emotional style, with attention-seeking behaviors. Patients rarely present for evaluation on their own, as many patients do not perceive that their behavior negatively affects their relationships or livelihood. There is a large body of literature that describes the disorder via a psychodynamic and psychoanalytic lens. However, there are few resources that focus on the treatment of the disorder by itself; rather, it is often discussed as a phenomenon embedded within or comorbid to additional diagnoses. Like many other personality disorders, it is thought to be a mosaic of genetic and environmental factors. These patients may be challenging to treat because of their limited insight, an inability to provide earnest feedback about their internal states, seductive and sexualized behaviors, and a distracting presentation meant to serve the patient’s needs rather than resolve behavioral, interpersonal, or emotional issues.",

We present the case of a 17-year-old female requiring psychiatric hospitalization for obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder with mixed affective features, who was subsequently diagnosed with primary Sjogren's syndrome. Treatment with potent immunosuppression resulted in remission of psychiatric illness. Due to a lack of awareness and/or the lack of specific biomarkers, clinicians may not associate psychiatric symptoms with autoimmune disease, including primary Sjogren's syndrome. This case demonstrates that Sjogren's syndrome may be a causative or aggravating factor in mental disorders and that autoimmune diseases should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric illness especially in cases of concurrent physical symptomatology and severity or treatment resistance of psychiatric disease.",

Research Questions: In aggressive obsession, there is the fear of self of not being aggressive with others, while in paranoid delirium there is the fear of being persecuted by others. Aim: The concept of schizo-obsessive disorder, with onset in adolescence with OC phenomenology, with subsequently negative symptoms, productive perceptual and ideational area (auditory hallucinations and pseudo-hallucinations, next to Kandinsky Clerambault syndrome). OC phenomenology acquires connotations different from schizophrenia onset, the patient never acquiring again a disorder total insight. Results: When obsessions and compulsions were related to the content of delusional ideas and hallucinations, other typical rituals of obsessive-compulsive disorders appeared too, the patient considered sometimes irrational and excessive. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms were present a significant period of the prodrome, of active phases and residual period, being time-consuming, causing distress and interfering patient’s routine, in addition to the schizophrenia deterioration. Conclusions: Social degradation is dictated mainly by the negative dimension of schizophrenia, secondly by energy consumption in fulfilling the rituals and compulsions and finally by the mood change in depressive sense. The family emotional climate in excess potentiates the negative inversion towards family, which amplifies the sensitiveness to rejection, sensitive relationship delirium, referentiality and finally social isolation.",

      "title": "Does Your Patient Have a Psychiatric Illness or Nonverbal Learning Disorder? Clinical Clues Help Differentiate Overlapping Symptoms and Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Patients who present with impairment in academic, cognitive, social, and vocational functioning might be struggling with an unrecognized learning disorder. Ten percent of the US population has some form of learning disability, and up to 40% of those with learning disorders may meet diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. (1), (2) Some learning disorders affect a person's ability to read, write, or do math, whereas less - recognized nonverbal learning disorder (NLD) impacts the social and emotional functioning of children, adolescents, and adults. Common features of NLD include: * deficits in nonlinguistic information processing * speech prosody deficits * difficulty reading facial expressions * associated impairment in interpersonal functioning. The severity of these deficits varies among individuals with NLD. Patients may experience chronic low self-esteem, anxiety, and mood symptoms because of their limited ability to express their feelings within an appropriate social context. NLD may be first misdiagnosed as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), or Asperger's disorder. In this article we review the underlying neurophysiology of NLD and present a clinical approach to these patients, including the differential diagnosis and factors that will allow clinicians to distinguish NLD from psychiatric conditions with symptomatic and syndromic overlap. We also describe treatment for patients with NLD. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Table 1 Clinical manifestation of nonverbal learning disorder Tactile - perceptual deficits and psychomotor coordination deficiencies, usually more marked on the left side Visual - spatial organization deficits Deficiencies in nonverbal problem solving, such as hypothesis testing and understanding cause - effect relationships Difficulty adapting to novel situations and reliance on rote behaviors Relative deficiencies in mechanical arithmetic with proficiencies in reading, word recognition, and spelling Well developed rote verbal - memory skills Verbosity characterized by poor pragmatics Deficits in social perception, judgment, and interaction source: reference 7 The learning process Learning is a cognitive process of acquiring and processing information and experiences from the environment that allows us to acquire knowledge, skills, and social abilities. When we learn how to relate to others, we undergo neurophysiology changes that subsequently influence behavior and the way we understand our environment. Deficits in learning processes or the ability to acquire relational skills result in impaired affect regulation in regard to others and may lead to low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, interpersonal conflict, and anger toward others. Learning influences a person's ability to navigate social relationships and perform academically and occupationally. The impact of learning deficits may be magnified in adulthood after an individual has suffered years of insecurities and poor self-esteem. Adults with learning disabilities often seek psychiatric treatment as a result of their disappointment about difficulties in relationships and work. NLD may coexist with or mimic other neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, problematic behavior within a family or at the workplace I is a common reason for referral to a psychiatrist. These behaviors may be influenced by a patient's NLD symptoms, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Persons with NLD are at increased risk for depression because of failures in coping, loss of self-esteem, internalized psychopathology, and other social and emotional strains. In addition, individuals with NLD may experience multiple psychosocial impairments, including difficulty maintaining employment, achieving goals, and maintaining relationships. …",

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

      "title": "Some Thoughts about Schizoid Dynamics",
      "abstract": "This chapter discusses inferential, phenomenologically oriented psychoanalytic understanding of people with schizoid tendencies. Patients with schizoid dynamics are more common than is typically thought, running the gamut from psychotically disturbed to enviably robust. The term “schizoid,” as used here, refers to the complex intrapsychic life of an introverted individual, rather than to the behavioral criteria for the DSM-5 diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder. High-functioning people with schizoid psychologies are found in the arts, the theoretical sciences, and the philosophical and spiritual disciplines. Their psychology may reflect a significant genetic predisposition toward a hypersensitive temperament and feelings of hyperpermeability. Because disruption of relationship with the few people to whom they feel authentically connected can be devastating, a common precipitant to seeking treatment is loss. Schizoid individuals can be remarkably attuned to unconscious thoughts, feelings, impulses, and nonverbal processes in others. Higher-functioning, interpersonally competent schizoid individuals tend to be attracted to psychoanalytic treatment. In psychotherapy, they can become conscious of dependent longings that stimulate defensive withdrawal and aware of a hunger for recognition of their subjectivity. A successful therapy involves the elaboration and acceptance of the self in the presence of an accepting, nonintrusive, responsive therapist. A therapist’s judicious self-disclosure can catalyze the therapy with schizoid clients because it may validate their subjective experience, which has often been dismissed as incomprehensible. Therapists must be aware, however, of the tendency of patients with schizoid dynamics to use the professional relationship as a substitute for developing intimate attachments in their daily life.",

      "abstract": "In cognitive-behaviour therapy attention paid to the self and identity has primarily involved self-representations (the Me-Self) rather than how the self is experienced (the I-Self). Within the I-Self experiences vary on a continuum from pre-reflective consciousness (raw experienced perceptions and states of being) to self-awareness (permitting reflection on and evaluation of subjective experience). There is considerable evidence that the I-Self is affected in many if not all disorders, and I review illustrative studies of OCD, eating disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, PTSD, and personality disorder. These indicate that patients often experience themselves as being defective in various ways, or as having an unstable or contradictory I-Self. Recognition of this neglected aspect of patients' experience has major implications for assessment and treatment. For example, acknowledgment that their sense of self may fluctuate dramatically from moment to moment, may be fragmented, or may consist of a sense of emptiness, may help to build a more empathic therapeutic relationship. If frightening or distressing pre-reflective experiences are the cause of avoidance or other maladaptive coping strategies, conscious attention paid to them in therapy may help to better integrate the I-Self and Me-Self, restoring a sense of predictability and control.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parental alienation is a mental condition in which a child—usually one whose parents are engaged in a high‐conflict separation or divorce—allies himself or herself strongly with one parent (the preferred parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate justification. Parental alienation usually comes about when the preferred parent indoctrinates the child to fear and hate the rejected or alienated parent. Typically, the alienating parent interferes with or limits the child's contact with the rejected parent. Alienating parents have been described as being angry and vindictive and having maladaptive personality traits. Parental alienation frequently causes short‐term and long‐term psychological problems in the affected children. Many writers have concluded that causing parental alienation is a form of psychological child abuse.",

      "title": "Stigma Masyarakat Terhadap Penderita Skizofrenia",
      "abstract": "Society's stigma against schizophrenia sufferers is a negative and discriminatory behavior towards individuals who suffer from schizophrenia. This stigma develops because of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination that exist in society towards people with schizophrenia. Stigma can hinder schizophrenic clients' recovery, reduce their quality of life, and worsen their social behavior. To reduce the stigma against schizophrenia sufferers, knowledge is needed that can increase public awareness about schizophrenia and help them understand that schizophrenia sufferers are individuals who need knowledge, empathy and the best behavior. Behavior that respects schizophrenic sufferers is also required, such as paying attention to the principle of respecting schizophrenic sufferers in accepting sufferers. The stigma against schizophrenia may also be caused by fear of violence or unpredictable behavior from individuals with this condition. Although only a small proportion of people with schizophrenia may be involved in violence, sensationalistic media coverage often exposes these rare cases, leading to widespread negative perceptions of all schizophrenics. The impact of societal stigma against schizophrenia can be very detrimental for individuals living with this condition. They may experience discrimination at work, at school, or even in their own neighborhood. Stigma can also prevent individuals from seeking the care they need. Fearful of being ostracized or judged by society, many people with schizophrenia may refuse to seek professional help, which in turn may worsen their condition. To overcome society's stigma against schizophrenia, public education and awareness are essential. Campaigns that highlight the facts about schizophrenia, debunk myths and stereotypes, and emphasize the importance of empathy and support for individuals living with this condition can help gradually change public perceptions. In addition, social support and community integration are also important in reducing stigma. The more society becomes involved in supporting individuals with schizophrenia, the less stigma they will face. This could involve forming support groups, training programs to teach daily living skills, or advocacy campaigns to create a more inclusive environment for everyone. With the right education and adequate support, we can change society's perception of schizophrenia and create a more welcoming and supportive environment for individuals living with this mental disorder.",

Case Presentation: A single, obese male patient with aggressive behaviors, intellectual disabilities, hyperphagia and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder was admitted for treatment. Behavioral problems and impaired interpersonal relationship was caused many of next problems. Also metabolic syndrome is suggested for him. Conclusion: In a mental retard patient, obsession may not be a chief complaint, but we saw compulsive behavior dominantly in this patient. Some cultural factors like stigma, low social support and unsuitable community approach towards him may be effective in this case. So, further evaluations and treatment of psychiatric and medical co morbidities is highly needed in an adolescent with mental retardation.",

In dealing with this overlap, we found that only early age at onset, or major depression with an anxiety disorder or secondary alcoholism, were independently related to increased risk of major depression in relatives. Once the effects of these proband factors had been taken into account, endogenous, delusional, melancholic, or autonomous symptom patterns, recurrent depression, history of hospitalization, and suicidal ideation or attempts in probands were not associated with increased risk of major depression in relatives.",

Depression can seriously impact a child’s academic achievement, social interactions and other aspects of their daily lives. [1] The reported prevalence of depression is 1 to 2% in prepubescent children, 3 to 8% in younger teenagers and 14% in teenagers aged 15 to 18; overall, it is estimated that 20% of the population will experience at least one episode of depression prior to the age of 18. [2] During childhood there is no significant gender difference in the prevalence of depression, but after puberty female rates of depression become higher than those for males. [3] The etiology of childhood depression remains unclear: it may be caused by the interaction of various risk factors and protective factors including genetic predisposition, abnormalities of the structure and function of the brain, psychological and physiological stressors, poor parental relationships, and so forth.

In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by the breakdown of thought processes and emotional disorders. This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others. The following research article examines all the factors that can influence the onset and progression of the disease.",

Description of clinical case C. is a 14 teenager who comes to a mental health center for the first time a year ago for having numerous self-injuries in the forearm. She says that she cannot avoid doing so in moments of anxiety and that, in addition, when she is hurt she calms down. Throughout the interviews, C. relates that after the death of her best friend in a traffic accident she is alone and with episodes of anxiety. Exploration and complementary tests It is important to analyze the risk factors of self-injurious behaviors in adolescence such as: – personal characteristic; – psychiatric disorders; – family characteristics; – mass media. Diagnosis Depressive episode (F32). Differential diagnosis In general, self-injury is considered as a symptom or characteristic of a specific psychiatric disorder. Stereotyped self-injury is characteristic of processes of cognitive deficit of the level of severe and profound mental retardation. Compulsive self-harm involves symptomatic habits such as severe scratching of the skin or already differentiated psychiatric entities, such as trichotillomania, onicofagia or delusional parasitosis… Important psychotic disorder. Conclusions Following the Task Force's criteria, in relation to probably effective therapies, it can be concluded that the therapy based on mentation for adolescents (MBT-A) is the first effective treatment for the treatment of self-harm in adolescents.

      "title": "Depression in psychosis: where does it come from?",

It can appear both in the prodrome of a psychotic decompensation and in the acute phase, as well as after its resolution. But is it part of the disease itself? Is it an experiential reaction to the assumption of the sickness or is it an independent entity? Can it be produced or exacerbated by antipsychotics? Objectives This case study aims to analyze the clinical presentation of depressive symptoms in a patient with schizophrenia. Methods A review of the literature on affective symptomatology which may occur in psychosis. Results A 34-year-old male with a history in Mental Health since the age of 16, with diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He has presented at least 5 depressive episodes and several severe self-harming attempts. He is on treatment with olanzapine, clonazepam, quetiapine and aripiprazole. During a follow-up, he reports intensification of low mood in the last few weeks due to sentimental break-up, clinophilia and social isolation. He spends the day in his room with the curtains lowered, he has neglected his personal hygiene, and verbalizes thoughts of death. He shows poor functioning, slowed thinking and lack of energy. His mother reports that he has had self-aggressive behaviors, such as hitting his face and eating his faeces. Sensory and perceptual disturbances are not excluded. Given the current depressive affective state and risk of commiting suicide, it is decided to admit him to the hospital and to start treatment with fluoxetine. A few weeks after hospital discharge, he continues with poor functioning and isolation, but his mood is better and his thoughts of death have disappeared. Conclusions Although clear differentiation between depressive and psychotic symptomatology has been classically described, both symptoms are often associated. Affective symptoms can be part of different stages of the disease, secondary to medication, due to insight phenomena or part of schizoaffective disorder and psychotic depressions. Depressive symptomatology can also be confused with the presentation of negative symptoms. They both share clinical manifestations such as anergy, social isolation and lack of interest; but while in depression there is a sad mood, in negative symptons there is emotional flattering. Also, positive symptomatology can simulate social withdrawal, usually seen in depression. Depression in an acute phase has historically been related to a better prognosis, although several studies indicate that depression in a chronic phase causes a higher risk of suicide and relapses. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. In our case, the patient suffers from major affective symptoms regarding his life situation, which may be overlapped by isolation due to a likely positive symptomatology, without dismissing possible negative symptomatology as a result of many years of evolution of his disease.

This at least is the feeling of many professionals in the field of child development in Britain, who believe that in recent years they have been seeing more children with autistic spectrum disorders. Autism was first characterised in 1943 by Kanner,1 who described a group of children with an unusual pattern of behaviour present from birth or before 30 months. He called this “early infantile autism.” His essential criteria for diagnosis were social aloofness and elaborate repetitive routines.2 Subsequent epidemiological studies have shown that autism is not, as Kanner first thought, a unique and separate condition occurring in children of otherwise normal development but that it is closely related to a range of developmental disorders.3 4 These include Asperger's syndrome,5 a condition characterised by borderline or normal IQ; social isolation or naive, inappropriate social interaction; intensive interest in only one or two subjects; a narrow, repetitive life style; limited or inappropriate intonation and body language; and poor motor coordination.\n\nAutistic spectrum disorders share a triad of impaired social interaction, communication, and imagination, associated with a rigid, repetitive pattern of behaviour.

Background Psychotic disorders are low prevalence disorders, affecting between 1-2% of the adult population.1 Onset of first-episode psychosis (FEP), the first presentation of psychotic symptoms, is typically during late adolescent and early adult years.1, 2 Positive psychotic symptoms may include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and behaviour.3, 4 Onset may be sudden or insidious, though most individuals experience a prodromal phase manifested by the gradual development of a variety of signs and symptoms that are commonly vague and nonspecific e.g. functional and social decline, sleep disturbance and mood symptoms.4-6 Individuals detected in this phase are considered to be ‘ultra high risk’ clinically, though development of psychosis is not inevitable.7 Though low in prevalence, psychotic disorders account for a high proportion of resources allocated to mental health services and are associated with significant challenges for those with the illness as well as their families.1, 2 During late adolescent and early adult years a young person is developing in many areas including formation of friendships, vocational goals, and general independence.2 The experience of mental illness during these formative years can divert a person from the trajectory of normal life development and significantly disrupt the person's life goals.8, 9 For those presenting at a later stage in life, other developmental issues will be of importance such as partners and children.10 A recent Australian national survey of people living with a psychotic illness, designed to capture the impact of psychosis, concluded that ‘psychosis is associated with substantial and persistent disability’.2(p.97) More specifically, participants named the following challenges: financial difficulties (42.7%), loneliness (37.2%), unemployment (35.1%), poor physical health (27.4%) uncontrolled symptoms of mental illness (25.7%), lack of stable/suitable housing (18.1%) and stigma (11.6%).2 Whilst some people will experience one psychotic episode and obtain full recovery, a significant number (61.5%) reported recurrent episodes with good or partial recovery during episodes and 30.5% experienced a continuous chronic illness.2 Early intervention for FEP has been a focus of care for several decades. It arose from the premise that the early years of illness are a ‘critical period’ for intervention when there can be significant decline but also most scope for influencing longer term prognosis.9, 11, 12 The main aims of such services are to shorten the course of the initial psychotic episode, reduce the severity of the illness, and subsequently minimize disruption to the person's life.9, 12 Key components of early intervention include medication to reduce symptoms and psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting the individual's recovery.13 Even after onset of psychosis there is typically a delay in accessing appropriate treatment.14 The period of time between onset of first psychotic symptom and first treatment, referred to as the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), has been a major focus of research and intervention. This is because DUP is considered to be an important and malleable prognostic factor. A systematic review to establish whether DUP is associated with prognosis included a meta-analysis of 26 studies from diverse cultural backgrounds including 4490 participants.15 The results showed there is evidence of a moderate association between DUP and symptomatic and functional outcome in the short term (6-12 month follow up), though it remains inconclusive as to whether reducing a person's DUP improves overall prognosis. Mean DUP was found to be two years.15 The Treatment and Intervention in Psychosis (TIPS) early detection and intervention programme in Norway successfully reduced median DUP from 16 to 5 weeks.16 At ten-year follow up, though reported symptoms were comparable across the early detection group and usual detection group, there were significant gains in recovery for the early detection group due to increased employment.17 Reducing DUP remains a common service goal.13 DUP is typically long, meaning individuals18 and their families19-21 are often required to cope with distressing symptoms for many months or longer. Many individuals and families report high levels of distress during the stage of untreated psychosis. First-episode psychosis is a high-risk period for suicidality22 which is important as previous suicide attempts are predictors of later attempts and completed suicide.23 Gersen et al24 found that families of relatives with a FEP predominantly use adaptive coping strategies. In contrast, families of individuals with a more chronic illness reportedly use increased maladaptive strategies, suggesting the impact of burden and stress of care over time on coping.24, 25 A recent systematic review measuring the effectiveness of early intervention on clinical outcome was inconclusive, with the exception of sustained positive impact in the areas of employment and family.26 Whilst this may have implications for future funding directives, it does not reduce the need for individuals with a FEP to receive early and appropriate intervention. Minimising the impact of psychosis for individuals and improving outcome remains a priority in Clinical Practice Guidelines in many countries.3, 27, 28 Quick and timely access to services can positively impact on the distress experienced by both the ill person and their families. Reaching those individuals experiencing a FEP during the early stages of illness requires ‘early detection of psychosis in the community and understanding factors associated with and contributing to delay in help-seeking’.14(p.76) The literature related to pathways to care explores barriers and facilitators to accessing services. This encompasses help-seeking behaviour, accessibility of services and service response.9, 29, 30 Help-seeking can be defined as ‘“the behaviour of actively seeking help from other people” (Rickwood, Deane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005, p. 4)31 and can be directed towards formal sources, such as mental health professionals, or informal sources, such as family and friends’ (Dr Coralie Wilson, personal communication, 2012 Mar 27). For young people informal sources are the preferred source of help.31, 32 In FEP it is frequently family members that initiate successful contacts for their relatives20, 33 and often without the affected individual participating in the contact.34 Before help-seeking can occur there needs to be a recognition that the person is in need of help.32 Recognition that a disorder is developing, knowledge of treatment options and knowledge of effective help-seeking strategies are all components of ‘mental health literacy’.32 Community surveys of mental health literacy show that many people are unable to recognize mental illness, though there is evidence that improvements can be made by education strategies at a community level.16, 32 This knowledge is now impacting upon policy development, with programmes designed to develop people's mental health literacy and help-seeking skills.16, 27, 32, 35 In a systematic review aiming to understand and measure pathways to care in FEP, Singh14 notes that there remains a delay for relatives to seek help even when a problem has become evident. Understanding individuals' personal narratives and journeys is one method of enhancing understanding of the processes that affect help-seeking.14 Delays in accessing appropriate treatment arise at all levels including illness recognition, help-seeking and service response. Help-seeking is just one factor that can impact on delay to treatment.36 Delays at service level can also be significant and for varied reasons, e.g. lack of affordable services, inflexibility of appointments37 and delayed diagnosis within mental health services.38 Common themes relating to delayed help-seeking include: stigma, misattribution of symptoms (e.g. drugs, stress or typical changes of adolescence), not knowing where to go, hope that the symptoms will go away without intervention, and a raised threshold for seeking help.5, 39, 40 Factors associated with successful help-seeking include: frank psychotic symptoms, depression and suicidal thinking and reaching a crisis.5, 18, 20 When studies include both individuals and families of FEP, considerable congruence is reported in themes and experiences when help-seeking.18, 21 Research to date provides information regarding potential barriers and facilitators to help-seeking in a FEP. Increased awareness of the impact of prolonged DUP and benefits of early intervention has driven the need to further explore and understand the pathways to care for people experiencing a FEP. A preliminary search of the literature reveals qualitative studies exploring individuals' and their carers' experiences of help-seeking during a FEP.5, 21, 41 Carers play a crucial role in accessing help for relatives14, 21, often being the primary and sole help-seeker.34 A search of the Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute Library of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, CINAHL and PROSPERO databases did not reveal any previous or planned systematic reviews of qualitative evidence on this topic. A synthesis of the relevant studies of carers' experiences will add to the understanding of illness recognition, help-seeking strategies utilized and service response and may provide important information regarding pathways to care for those experiencing a FEP. Definition of terms First-episode psychosis (FEP) For the purpose of this review all operational definitions of FEP will be considered. This means first-episode may be defined as first treatment contact, duration of antipsychotic medication use or duration of psychosis.42 Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include carers of a relative with a FEP. This means first presentation of psychotic symptoms with no limit to duration of untreated psychosis. Method of diagnosis may be according to any of the editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), research diagnostic criteria relevant to the country of study or confirmed by a psychiatrist or other health care professional. Psychotic symptoms may include hallucinations and delusions. Psychotic disorders may include: Schizophrenia Schizoaffective disorders Mania with psychotic symptoms Depression with psychotic symptoms Delusional disorders Acute and transient psychotic disorders Other and unspecified non-organic psychotic disorder. There will be no age restriction for the person experiencing the psychosis. Carers could be a parent, sibling, spouse or other relative of any age. Studies that predominantly include individuals in the prepsychotic or ultra high-risk stage of illness will be excluded due to the ‘low’ conversion rate to psychosis. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that investigate the experience of carers of a relative with a first-episode psychosis, and in particular their experience preceding and of seeking help from both informal (family and friends) and formal (services) sources. Types of outcomes The review will consider research conducted in any mental health care setting including inpatient, outpatient and community. Types of studies This review will consider studies that focus on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. In the absence of research studies, other text such as opinion papers and reports will be considered. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Studies published in English will be considered for inclusion in this review. Studies published between January 1990 and August 2012 will be considered for inclusion in this review. This is due to focus of care on first-episode psychosis and pathways to care developing in the early 1990's. The databases to be searched include: CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and Embase. The search for unpublished studies will include: Mednar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Trove, relevant professional bodies in the field of Early Intervention in Psychosis and carers in mental health. Initial keywords to be used will be: help-seeking; care-givers; first-episode psychosis; qualitative. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Data will be extracted from qualitative research papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-QARI (Appendix I). The data extracted will include specific details about the phenomena of interest, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Qualitative research findings will, where possible, be pooled using JBI-QARI. This will involve the aggregation or synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation, through assembling the findings rated according to their quality, and categorising these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning. These categories are then subjected to a meta-synthesis in order to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesized findings that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Where textual pooling is not possible, the findings will be presented in narrative form. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

They return to their homes and make a fairly satisfactory social, marital, and industrial adjustment. Others make a moderate improvement and make marginal adjustments in these areas. Many require almost continuous hospitalization. The severity of the psychotic behavior on admission, the psychometric and projective tests, and the social history fail as accurate guides in prognosis. Race, sex, creed, and indices of endocrine disturbance likewise fail to correlate with the degree of improvement. Even the method of treatment fails to alter appreciably the natural course of the illness. Recent studies by Hastings<sup>1</sup>reaffirm this observation, which has been made repeatedly. These individual differences in patients must represent basic neurophysiologic variants.

Depressive development has proved most typical for advanced age. Such manifestations as chronic subdepression, diffuse hypochondria, egocentrism and rent orientations are universal for all clinical variants of senile pathological development of personality. According to a regression analysis the development of psychogenic disturbances in the second half of life is facilitated by the objective significance and persistence of traumatic situations, a low professional level of patients and a number of other socio-psychological and biological characteristics of the person.",

She was admitted to a psychogeriatric ward with depressive symptoms, delusions and change of personality. We treated the condition as a depressive psychosis, but with little success. She was mentally rigid, withdrawn, behaved inappropriately and did not cooperate in the treatment. After months of gradual worsening we suspected frontotemporal dementia. Cognitive testing showed abnormal scores in tasks of executive functions but no major memory or language problems. Computerised tomography was negative. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) showed marked hypoperfusion especially in the frontal lobes and with the lowest function on the left side. The investigations thus supported the diagnosis. All medication was tapered and she moved to a dementia care unit in her community. The case illustrates some of the diagnostic challenges in psychogeriatric medicine. Early frontotemporal dementia may easily be mistaken for depression, especially when apathy and withdrawal is dominant (apathetic/pseudodepressive subtype) and not disinhibition and inappropriate behaviour (disinhibited subtype).",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

The psychometric properties of most SCD' scales are not enough studied, but they seem to have a high interrater reliability, internal consistency and concurrent validity. The number of SCD is related to female sex, and inversely to educative level and the lack of insight into illness. In the acute stage of illness, the SCD are associated to positive symptoms and they can then reflect the process activity of the schizophrenia. In the remission stage of illness, the SCD are related to negative symptoms and they are the subjective experience of the psychological deficit. A theory of the SCD in the framework of the vulnerability/stress model of schizophrenia is proposed.",

Several methodological limitations have made difficult the comparison among studies and, as a consequence, the research interest has been little, leading to the absence of late-onset schizophrenia and paraphrenia in current official classifications. Aims and methodology To highlight the specific symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia as well as its differences with other psychoses though the study of a case report. Results A 70-year-old woman developed psychotic symptoms during the last seven years, consisting of auditory and olfactory hallucinations, telepathic phenomena and injury delusions, erotomania and thought control, with a high level of systematization and fantasy. She was admitted in an inpatient unit. She was treated with risperidone and the psychotic symptoms got better. At the time of hospital discharge, hallucinations and delusional thoughts had disappeared and no behavioral or emotional disorder was observed. Some weeks later, risperidone had to be substituted by paliperidone due to side effects, such as tremor, sialorrhea and parkinsonism. Conclusions Late-onset schizophrenic psychosis is not as exceptional as it has been traditionally considered. One of the main problems is that current classifications do not include specific diagnostic categories for cases of late or very-late-onset psychoses. It would be necessary that future ICD-11 and DSM-V classifications will include different-age criteria when diagnosing mental disorders.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia, Not a Psychotic Disorder: Bleuler Revisited",
      "abstract": "Current diagnostic criteria delineate schizophrenia as a discrete entity essentially defined by positive symptoms. However, the role of positive symptoms in psychiatry is being questioned. There is compelling evidence that psychotic manifestations are expressed in the population in a continuum of varying degrees of severity, ranging from normality to full-blown psychosis. In most cases these phenomena do not persist, but they constitute risk factors for psychiatric disorders in general. Psychotic symptoms are also present in most non-psychotic psychiatric diagnoses, being a marker of severity. Research revealed that hallucinations and delusions appear to have distinct, independent biological underpinnings–in the general population, in psychotic, and in non-psychotic disorders as well. On the other hand, negative symptoms were seen to: be far more restricted to schizophrenia, have other underlying pathophysiology than positive symptoms, predict outcome and treatment response in schizophrenia, and start before the first psychotic outbreak. The current work discusses the concept of schizophrenia, suggesting that a greater emphasis should be put on cases where psychotic symptoms emerge in a premorbid subtly increasing negative/cognitive symptoms background. In those cases, psychosis would have a different course and outcome while psychosis occurring in the absence of such background deterioration would be more benign–probably having no, or a milder, underlying degenerative process. This reformulation should better drive psychopathological classification, face positive symptoms as epiphenomenon of the schizophrenia process, and dishevel stigma from schizophrenia and from delusions and hallucinations.",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "title": "Instrumental rationality and suicide in schizophrenia: a case for rational suicide?",
      "abstract": "It is estimated that up to 7500 people develop schizophrenia each year in the UK. Schizophrenia has significant consequences, with 28% of the excess mortality in schizophrenia being attributed to suicide. Previous research suggests that suicide in schizophrenia may be more related to affective factors such as depression and hopelessness, rather than psychotic symptoms themselves. Considering suicide in schizophrenia within this framework enables us to develop a novel philosophical approach, in which suicide may not be related to loss of self-consciousness, thought processing dysfunctions or perception disturbances. The action of suicide may be due neither to persistent hallucinations nor other psychotic symptoms, such as delusional beliefs, but to other underexamined, perhaps rational reasons, such as extreme social isolation, severe depression or emotional withdrawal. This paper does not examine the moral character of suicide. Instead, it argues that we should conceive the action of suicide in schizophrenia as an act that is not necessarily irrational. People with schizophrenia might end their life based on reasons if suicide is the best means to achieve their ends. However, the paper does not support assisted suicide. It aims to provide a better understanding of the reasons why people take their own lives and suggests that understanding can inform effective interventions to reduce high rates of suicide.",

Yet, a closer look at emotional experience reveals that all is not well in the experience domain. People with schizophrenia have difficulty anticipating emotional events and maintaining or savoring their emotional experiences, as evidenced in behavioral, psychophysiological, and brain imaging studies. Furthermore, people with schizophrenia have difficulty integrating emotion perception with context and reporting on feelings that are differently valenced than presented emotional stimuli. Differences in brain activation are typically observed in areas tightly coupled with cognitive control, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and thus the latest research on emotion in schizophrenia explicitly integrates emotion and cognition. Translational research holds promise to identify when in the course of the disorder emotion deficits emerge and to develop more effective interventions for schizophrenia.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "A Psychopathological Consideration on the Neurotic Depersonalization",
      "abstract": "The author has tried a life-historical analysis on thirty cases of neurotic depersonalization in regard to the psychogenesis. At the same time, the ego structure in these patients has been discussed.1) The ability of estimation of love in these patients was seriously twisted as they had been loved too much or too little in their infancy. The character features such as peculiar sensitiveness in interpersonal relationship, monopolistic tendency, strong need for might, self-assertion, selfishness, etc. were all attribuable to the various factors in their infantile life-history. In common to the neurotics, the frustration tolerance (especially for love) was also extremely faible and the socialization of personality was pretty insufficient in these patients. This fact means the elevated susceptibility to affective frustrations in the future.2) The depersonalization appears always after the intense inner tension for certain period, which signifies the consumption of psychological force ( Janet). The abrupt abasement of psychological tension is motivated by the sudden affective deprivation or by the strong menaces to or the sudden interruption of the tendency of self-enlargement in such circumstances. The depersonalization is caused by the reduction of the secondary action ( Janet) which is brought about by the abasement of psychological tension. At the same time, the state completely narcissistic would develop in such conditions just mentioned. On the contrary, the displacement of these motives and the resolution of the inner tension will play an important role in the disparition of the depersonalization symptoms.3) Last of all, the depersonalization begins, according to Federn, whenever the outer ego-boundary becomes weak and consequently the egotized data concerned lose the energy cathexes. This weakening of the outer ego-boundary results, in my opinion, from the ego weakness which is attribuable to constitutional factors in one hand and to the intense inner tension for certain period on the other. In the psychogenesis of depersonalization, Federn emphasized the mechanism of projection of this primary ego disturbance to the outer objects. From the psychoanlytic point of view, the reduction of libido and mortido components in the ego cathexes to objects is the result of the relative increase of medial ego cathexes, which is the most primitive form of ego libido (Federn), caused by the lifehistorically developped narcissism. The organs and the functions to which libido is mostly invested in healthy state are influenced most seriously in the deprsonalized patients. Finally, it is relatively strengthened by the weakening of tile inner ego-boundary.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Objectives Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is a highly prevalent personality disorder, especially in clinical settings, yet scarcely researched. People diagnosed with AvPD have severe impairments in functioning and suffer greatly, yet we still lack meta-analytic evidence for therapy and only a few RCTs are conducted. Patient factors are the most important for outcome in therapy, in general. Lack of agency might be a core deficit in people diagnosed with AvPD. Their conditions might be improved if we understand their agency better. We review previous research regarding psychological mechanisms and interpersonal relationships that facilitate or hinder agency in AvPD in daily life and psychotherapy. Methods Summarizing original literature in a narrative review with reflexive thematic analysis. Results People diagnosed with AvPD seem to have significant impairments in their sense of agency due to a lack of emotional awareness, an overweight of inhibiting vs. activating emotions, and difficulties regulating emotions. Difficulties also seem related to high levels of attachment avoidance and fear, creating strong ambivalence in social needs, in addition to a strong tendency to subordinate to others. A weak sense of self with a poor narrative, self-doubt, and harsh self-critique makes a reflexive and intentional stand increasingly difficult for these people. Conclusion This review gives a clinically meaningful understanding of core strengths and deficits in the personality functioning of AvPD that can help clinicians map out important therapeutic work, identify barriers to client-agency in therapy, and work through relational difficulties in the therapeutic alliance.",

      "title": "Domestic violence and abuse through a psychological lens",
      "abstract": "Seeing domestic violence and abuse through a psychological lens can entail considering violence as a trauma and being concerned with its potential effect on mental health. As a traumatic event, domestic violence can be described as severe. It commonly persists over time, contains multiple types of violence, and takes place within a significant relationship, which may limit the possibility to escape and involve betrayal. Mental health consequences of domestic violence can be severe and complex, sometimes including symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or substance abuse disorders. For children, an additional problem is that domestic violence may interfere with their development and attachment. Cross-cultural research may elucidate the role of culture in domestic violence prevalence, mental health risk and coping. Not all survivors struggle with symptoms of mental health problems, and certain risk and protective factors may increase or decrease the risk. One potent risk factor for mental health problems is shame. As a social emotion, shame relates to negative beliefs and assumptions about violence and victims held by their social surroundings. Shame is thus not only a characteristic of the individual victim, but also of her/his social group, and society at large. The severity of potential mental health problems after experiences with violence means that many survivors may need psychological treatment. Various trauma-treatment models are effective in reducing symptoms. However, treatment is not available for all. New innovations, including online modules, show promise in making treatment more available for victims.",

      "abstract": "Patients with acne may develop psychological problems as a consequence of their condition – often independent of the severity of their skin condition. Emotional problems due to the disease should be taken seriously and included in the treatment plan. A purely dermatological therapy may not achieve its purpose. Even mild to moderate disease can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation, and psychologic change does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. Acne patients suffer particularly under social limitations and reduced quality of life. Psychic comorbidities in acne are probably greater than generally assumed. Attention should be paid to psychosomatic aspects especially if there is suspicion of depressive-anxious disorders, particularly with evidence of suicidal tendencies, body dysmorphic disorders, or also of disrupted compliance. Therefore, patients who report particularly high emotional distress or dysmorphic tendencies due to the disease should be treated adequately, if possible, by interdisciplinary therapy. The dermatologist must have some knowledge of the basics of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, which sometimes must be coupled with systemic and topical treatments of acne in conjunction with socalled psychosomatic basic treatment.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

The confused elder is more often anxious, very disoriented, with poor onirism, disturbed sleep, ideas of persecution and behavior disorders. Even if a multiple causality is usual, initiating circumstances come principally from an affective source. There is rupture with customary situation of the elder which hold a plurality of risk factors. These confusional disorders increase with aging and cognitive impairment. Late life delusional subject has also persecutory ideation without dissociation but with emotional reactions and affective changes. Different factors promote birth of late life delusion (personality features, isolation, sensory defect...). On psychodynamic way, these two disorders are issued from a breakdown followed by a more or less durable appointment. Confusion agrees with a somatic and psychic regression (consciousness disorganization). This is an elder's attempt to prevent anxiety. Late life delusion lays on denial and projective mecanisms. It is jointed with prejudice and intrusion (with regard to ownership, health and reputation). This is an elder's attempt to establish defences against depression. In the two situations, treatment consists on a biological regulation associated with psychodynamic approach taking elder personality, actual condition and recent life events into account.",

      "abstract": "• Summary: Somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes are defined as the presence of physical symptoms in the absence of sufficient tissue or organ damage to account for the degree of pain or dysfunction. Many people who suffer from these disorders have a history of childhood abuse. Because these individuals may also have a number of other difficulties in living, social workers encounter such clients in diverse fields of practice. Clients who fall into the category of adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder may experience certain interventions by doctors, therapists, and other helping professionals (including social workers) as repeating interactions they had with their abusers. • Findings: Adult survivors of abuse who have a somatoform disorder often have parallel experiences in terms of their abuse and their somatic symptoms: important others communicate that the abuse and the symptoms are not real, are the client’s fault, and/or that the client is over-reacting to the abuse and symptoms. Furthermore, adult survivors of abuse may experience helping professionals as distinctly non-nurturing and as engaging in distancing behaviours. These interactions may stand in the way of helping members of this population, or even add to the client’s distress. There are specific practices in which the social worker may engage to help avoid these kinds of relations. • Applications: Social workers in a number of fields of practice may be alerted to dynamics common among adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder. In the event that a client falls into this category, the informed social worker can avoid recapitulating abuse dynamics as well as help clients understand their diagnosis and why interactions with helping professionals may have been upsetting.",

A high percentage are related to language disorders, sensory dysfunctions, attention deficit disorder, bipolarity, intellectual disability or epilepsy, among other comorbidities. It is estimated that around 30% of children with autism, with typical early development, may present regression in the first years of life, which was already reported by Kanner in one of his original cases. The term regression refers to the loss of social, communicative or motor skills. It is essential to be alert to any symptoms of autistic regression, since it is not always an unspecific usual manifestation of the clinical spectrum of autism. Although little is known about the pathogenesis of regression, it needs to be organised hierarchically, as it can be part of different conditions with a variety of causes.The aim of this study is to analyse distinct conditions that need to be addressed in the case of a child with autistic regression, including genetic and toxic causations, autoimmune and nutritional phenomena, and epilepsies.When faced with a case of autistic regression it is essential to try to identify the possible aetiology, as this can allow specific treatment and adequate genetic counselling to be established.Regresion autista: aspectos clinicos y etiologicos.Introduccion.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia remains a challenge for neurologists and psychiatrists as some behavioural symptoms of this illness and psychiatric disorders, such as apathy, are not specific. Aim: The paper aims at presenting the differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and primary psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Behavioural symptoms of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia overlap with symptoms typical for primary psychiatric disorders. Psychotic symptoms, apathy and inappropriate behaviour are prominent in schizophrenia. Repetitive behaviours are typical for obsessive-compulsive disorders. Inattention and impulsivity are common in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Disinhibition is typical of mania in the context of bipolar disorder. Thus, all these psychiatric diagnoses need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. This condition is associated with language deficits and more widespread executive and social cognition deficits. Also, the presence of neurological symptoms, such as oculomotor dysfunction, upper/lower motor neuron dysfunction or bradykinesia, may facilitate the diagnosis. Functional decline is observed during follow-up in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, but not in phenocopy syndrome. Conclusions: Differential diagnosis requires integration of behavioural and neuropsychological data with the results of neurological assessment and neuroimaging work-up. In ambiguous cases, if genetic testing is negative, only longitudinal observation can confirm the diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia or phenocopy syndrome.",

The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

      "title": "The importance of social relationships in the process of cognitive ageing",
      "abstract": "Due to ageing populations worldwide, the number of people with cognitive impairments and dementia is increasing rapidly. Insight in the risk factors is crucial in order to develop interventions that prevent or delay the development of the disease. We investigated to what extent social functioning is associated with cognitive decline. Three stages of cognitive decline are considered, including subjective memory complaints, cognitive decline and dementia. The findings in this PhD thesis show that multiple aspects of social functioning are associated with different stages of cognitive decline. Better feelings of affection and behavioral confirmation protect against the development of subjective memory complaints and contribute to the recovery thereof. In addition, people recovered more often from subjective memory complaints if they were in a relationship, had a larger family composition, and had better feelings of status. Poor social relationships were also associated with cognitive decline. This was found for both the structure (e.g. small social network or low frequency of social contact), and the function (e.g. low social support and feelings of loneliness) of social relations. Particularly a lack of social interaction is associated with incident dementia. This effect is of comparable strength as other well-established risk factors for dementia, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and depression. It is well-known that non-smoking, a healthy diet and physical activity reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Our findings show that better social functioning should be added to this list. This is an important fact for GPs, geriatricians or policymakers who may still wonder whether promoting social interaction could be beneficial. We therefore advocate that more attention is paid to social functioning in the prevention of dementia.",

      "title": "Expanding the Boundaries of Early Intervention for Psychosis: Intervening During the Prodrome",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;It has long been recognized that subclinical manifestations of schizophrenia are evident prior to the onset of full psychosis. This period of time, during which changes in behavior begin to emerge and then progress into more specific early signs and symptoms prior to the onset of frank psychosis, is conceptualized as the “prodrome” or “prodromal stage” of schizophrenia. The term prodrome is somewhat of a misnomer, given the connotation that illness will inevitably follow. Despite this semantic problem, the label is in wide use and in this context suggests only the potential for later development of psychosis or schizophrenia. Verification that an individual is truly at-risk for psychosis (or is in the prodromal stage) can only be determined by following subjects over time.

In schizophrenia this recovery was often associated with disabilities and the development of negative symptoms. The first contact with mental health services followed from the patient’s first ‘breakdown’. Functioning prior to the breakdown was recognized as important - for instance in schizophrenia the existence of a premorbid ‘schizoid personality ’ (withdrawn, shy, aloof, a bit odd) implied a poorer outcome.",

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

Individuals with CD are generally considered to be deceitful, hostile, and destructive. The symptoms categories associated with CD include (a) physical harm to people or animals, (b) destruction of property, (c) deceitfulness and theft, and (c) breaking societal norms. The severity of CD can be determined based upon the individual’s lack of empathy; greater lack of empathy across a variety of settings indicates more severe CD. In order to diagnose a child or adolescent with CD, the enduring and repetitive symptoms of CD must cause significant impairment in social, academic, and occupational functioning, occur more than once per week, and be present for at least three months (APA).",

New psychogenic syndromes in old age are either acute reactions to life stress or character developments which accentuate former personality features. The acute psychogenic reactions are manifested as depressive or hypochondriac syndromes, clearly related regarding time and content to the situational burden. Psychiatrists seldom see new psychoneuroses and neurotic reactions in the elderly and such patients are seldom admitted to psychiatric institutions.

It is usually unrecognized problem that may be associated with a highdistortion in managing claims of life. The aim of our study was to determinethe extent to which comorbid social phobia affects the severity and course ofschizophrenia. Thepublications were indentified in the database Medline and Web of Science usingthe key words 'schizophrenia comorbidity\" in combination with the terms \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder\". Otherrelevant sources of information were obtained from the cited works by importantarticles. Thecurrent state of research shows that comorbidity with social phobia is morecommon in schizophrenia than in the general population. The incidence ofcomorbid social phobia in psychotic disease states in range from 11 % to 36 %. Social phobia in psychotic patients remains largely unrecognized. If it isundetected and untreated, this comorbidity is associated with more severepsychotic symptoms, worse quality of life and lower self-esteem. It is anotherobstacle for patients suffering from schizophrenia that deterioratesfunctioning in everyday life. It also increases the tendency to socialisolation and overall worsens social adaptation. Patients with comorbid socialphobia and schizophrenia have a higher amount of lifetime suicide attempts, ofwhich they select the ways of suicide with higher lethality and often abusealcohol or addictive substance. Patients suffering from both schizophrenia and social phobia have a lowerquality of life, impaired functioning in life, a higher incidence of suicideattempts and increased risk of relapse of psychosis compared with those who donot suffer from comorbid social phobia. It is therefore necessary thatphysicians treating the patients with schizophrenia had in mind the possibilityof presence of comorbid social phobia and in case of its occurrence they alsotreat it.",

      "title": "“Bullying in Incognito Mode”: The evolution of sibling bullying",
      "abstract": "Sibling bullying, the lesser known counterpart of bullying is an unexplored entity, but the little research that exists has shown that it is almost as common as bullying by peers. Personality factors, interpersonal relationships, home environments and parental styles influence the development of bullying behaviors. The normalisation of certain actions by parents may lead to many bullying behaviours going unnoticed. In these cases, the feeling of security usually attached to the familial context is also lost in the victims. It has also been noted to spill over into other environments such as peer bullying and other modes, like cyber bullying. In addition to this arises the bully-victim situation, where the victim becomes the perpetrator, leading to a self propagating vicious cycle. The long term consequences include a higher risk for depression, anxiety, emotional dysregulation and even antisocial behaviour. In fact, multiple neurobiological correlates have also been established, such as alteration in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, raised C-reactive protein levels and abnormal immune functions. To prevent these long term adverse effects, interventions should be initiated early, starting with parental guidance and sensitisation, peer support groups and anti bullying programs in schools.",

These include family interventions, motivational interventions for substance misuse and for non-adherence to medication, cognitive remediation for neurocognitive deficits and cognitive-behavioural therapy for symptoms. Psychological interventions may explicitly target risk factors for poor outcome, such as substance use, or protective factors, such as adherence to medication, or be directed at specific symptoms or deficits. There is emerging evidence for efficacy of psychological treatments during, following and even prior to the first episode. Important areas for further study are how different treatment modalities can interact productively, and patient and carer preferences for treatment. Many trials of psychological treatments have design flaws and this tends to overestimate the treatment effect.",

      "title": "A Rare Case of Very Young-Onset Dementia Presenting as Conversion Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Dementia is uncommon in young adults and adolescents under the age of 40; genetic and metabolic problems are more common, and many show as a \"dementia plus\" syndrome, in which cognitive impairment occurs alongside more extensive neurological dysfunction. The presence of extrapyramidal, cerebellar, or peripheral nerve involvement is an important diagnostic indicator.[1] Psychotic symptoms are not included in the clinical diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Only a few authors have concentrated on this element of the presentation in the FTD case literature.[2] A 29-year-old woman, who had been married for 10 years, educated till high school, and working as an assistant in a parlor but not for the past 4 months, was brought with complaints of forgetfulness, irrelevant talk, irritability, impaired self-care, and episodic singing and dancing claiming to be possessed by a goddess lasting 5–10 minutes for the past 4 months. The symptoms were insidious in onset and progressive in nature. No past or family history of any psychiatric disorder was found. On mental status examination, rapport could not be established, the patient was oriented to only one person, and there were increased psychomotor activity in the form of restlessness, irrelevant talks with a confused, labile affect, formal thought disorder and preservation, and lack of insight and impaired judgment. A neurological evaluation showed equivocal Babinski signs bilaterally. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed more mild atrophy of the lateral temporal lobe than the medial temporal lobe [Figures 1 and 2]. Electroencephalogram (EEG), serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) autoimmune encephalopathy panels, and additional exhaustive testing for endocrinologic, immunologic, and infectious etiology were noncontributory. There was no improvement in treatment with antipsychotics and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The patient on follow-up showed deterioration in her symptoms along with the inability to recognize her family members. The patient passed away two years after the onset of her symptoms.Figure 1: T1 sagittal and coronal MRI sections, respectively, show mild prominence of sulcal spaces in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal region with the prominence of bilateral sylvian fissures (more in temporal lobes)—suggestive of mild cortical atrophy, which is highly disproportionate to the ageFigure 2: T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) coronal MRI sections, respectively, suggest hyperintensities, more pronounced at bilateral frontal white matter regionThe frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD) are a category of illnesses marked by frontal and temporal lobe degeneration. The average age of onset is 45–60 years (range: 20–75); males are more likely to be afflicted.[3] Up to 50% of patients have a favorable family history, and a variety of genetic factors have been found.[4] The tau gene on chromosome 17 is mutated in the biggest single group: FTDP-17. The clinical appearance of FTD is diverse and typically subtle, with behavioral problems, personality changes, lack of empathy, and motivation dominating. Early retirement may be required due to a loss of planning and judgment. Misdiagnoses such as treatment-resistant depression or Alzheimer's disease are common among families and caregivers who ascribe behavioral changes to marital troubles or a \"mid-life crisis.\" Behavioral rigidity, disinhibition, loss of social skills, fatuousness, emotional lability, and impulsivity are common as the disease progresses and are often accompanied by executive dysfunction, decreased verbal fluency, impaired abstraction, difficulty shifting set, motor and verbal perseveration, and stereotypies.[1] FTLD advances faster than Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with the FTD clinical subtype, concomitant motor neuron illness, or tau-negative neuropathology have the quickest progression.[5] Our patient's sickness progressed faster and steadily, which conformed to the natural history of FTD caused by a genetic mutation. It is frequently coupled with mental symptoms and extremely little (or perhaps nonexistent) brain atrophy on MRI, which can make the clinical picture difficult to interpret. To explain conversion disorder misdiagnoses, a number of theories have been presented. The \"subtle interplay\" of biological and psychological models of neuropsychiatric illness, limited access to advanced imaging, current customs of neurological evaluation of functional neurological symptom disorders, and a limited neurobiological understanding of functional neurological disorders are among them.[6] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

Social anhedonia in healthy people is related to changes in structure, activation, and connectivity of different regions in the prefrontal, temporal, parieto-temporal, and basal areas. In patients with schizophrenia the core fMRI correlates of social anhedonia are located in the temporal lobe. Studies in social anhedonia in depressions and other mental disorders are insufficient for drawing conclusions on this topic. Unlike physical anhedonia, social anhedonia demonstrates no specific link with the Nucleus accumbens volume or activation.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression in Patients with Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Depression is the third most common illness among patients with schizophrenia which negatively affects the course of the disease and significantly contributes to the mortality rate, due to increased suicide. Depression, along with negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, is one of the main factors that significantly decreases the quality of life and the disease prognosis in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, depression increases the frequency of exacerbations and readmissions, decreases the quality and duration of remissions and is associated with more frequent substance abuse and an increased economic burden. Data on the prevalence of depression among patients with schizophrenia are contradictory and are associated with a low detection rate of depression in such patients, a lack of clear diagnostic criteria and difficulties in differentiation between extrapyramidal and negative symptoms. The average prevalence of depression that meets the diagnostic criteria of major depressive episodes in patients with schizophrenia is 25% at a specific point, and 60% over the course of a lifetime; the frequency of subsyndromal depression is much higher. It is essential to distinguish between primary (axial syndrome) and secondary depressive symptoms (extrapyramidal symptoms, psychogenic or nosogenic reactions, social factors, etc.) to determine treatment strategies. The published data relating to randomized clinical trials for the development of evidence-based guidelines are limited. Current recommendations are based mainly on the results of small-scale trials and reviews. Certain atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, lurasidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, clozapine) are superior to typical antipsychotics in the reduction of depressive symptoms. Clozapine is effective in the management of patients at risk from suicide. The additional prescription of antidepressants, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy are not always effective and are only possible following the management of acute psychosis in cases when antipsychotic monotherapy proved to be ineffective.",

      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder is a common psychiatric disease; its respective prevalence is 2% in the general population, 3.3% in tertiary students, 7.4% among adolescent and adult psychiatric in-patients, and above 10% in patients of cosmetic surgery or dermatology. The most important symptom of the disease is the distorted perception of bodily appearance that leads to low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, social isolation and compulsive behaviours. The disease usually begins during adolescence (average age at onset: 16.7 years), the symptoms have a rather deleterious impact on social relationships, education, work and family life. Comorbidity with affective disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, alcoholism, and substance use disorders is common. The life quality of the affected patients is bad, the risk of suicide is high, and the occurrence of heteroaggressive behaviour is not infrequent either. Despite the great prevalence and the serious consequences, body dysmorphic disorder is diagnosed only in 15% of the cases, and it occurs relatively rarely that the individuals affected by the disease get an adequate treatment. The patients do not usually ask for help because they feel ashamed, or they look for help in wrong places because of lack of insight. In addition, quite many experts working in the health service are not sufficiently familiar with the pheno - mena of this disorder. The authors' objective is to provide a thorough review about body dysmorphic disorder with special regard to the results of the past decade. A substantial recent change is the fact that the disorder, previously categorized in the group of somatoform disorders, has been placed in the group of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5. A complex interplay of biological, psychological and sociocultural factors underlies the etio - patho genesis. Pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioural therapy are still regarded as the most effective treatments for body dysmorphic disorder. The modifications of the latter developed to target misperception of appearance, emotional dysfunction or perfectionism seem to represent promising therapeutic measures in addition to the application of novel methods of information technology.",

      "title": "Theoretical Perspectives on Mental Health and Illness: Introduction to Part I",
      "abstract": "Mental health and mental disorder represent two different areas of theory, research, and policy implications, reflecting our common tendency to dichotomize healthy and sick, normal and abnormal, sane and insane. David Mechanic (2006) argues that the term “mental health” has no clear or consistent meaning, and in terms of the sociological literature, this is generally true. Mental health is not merely the absence of disease or disorder; it involves self-esteem, mastery, and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships with others. While most of us fall short of optimal well-being (or happiness), those who experience mental health problems or psychological distress have been the focus of most sociological research. However, definitions of mental health problems, illnesses, or disorders are also not so straightforward. Following Horwitz (2002b), “mental diseases” reflect underlying internal dysfunctions that have universal features (i.e. schizophrenia and to a lesser degree bipolar disorder). A valid “mental disorder” reflects some internal psychological system that is unable to function as it should, and this dysfunction is socially inappropriate. For most disorders, symptoms are not specific indicators of discrete, underlying diseases (such as schizophrenia), instead many conditions arise from stressful social conditions (such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders). Cultural processes shape the symptoms associated with mental disorders, and it is important to distinguish mental disorders from normal reactions to social stressors. Horwitz (2002b) uses the terminology of “mental illness” to refer to those conditions which a particular group has defined as a mental illness (and often point to behaviors that are deemed deviant, for example homosexuality in previous psychiatric classifications). For simplicity, we will use the term mental health problem or disorder in this introduction – but students should keep in mind the implications of using the term mental illness. In Chapter 1, Horwitz argues that sociological approaches regard mental health and mental health problems as aspects of social circumstances. He provides a very thorough overview of how various social conditions affect levels of mental health and mental health problems, and in turn how social contexts shape the definition as well as the response to mental health problems. Chapter 1 develops a framework for a sociological understanding of mental disorder and mental health problems and also directs the reader to other chapters in the volume that illustrate Horwitz's arguments.",

      "title": "PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS, AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR AND SEIZURES: A CASE REPORT",
      "abstract": "Background The diagnostic category of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) refers to a group of disorders characterized by delays in the development of socialization and communication skills. Symptoms may include problems with using and understanding language, difficulties relating to people, objects and events, as well as difficulties in changing routine or familiar surroundings, repetitive body movements or behaviour disorders. The behaviour disorders (aggressive behaviours, SIB) can occur and manifest with a large spectrum of clinical symptoms; they usually can be treated with antipsychotic medications. However, when no response to antipsychotics is observed, episodes of aggressive behaviour could be related to epilepsy, occurring in the context of high emotional arousal, anger or fear. Methods We report the case of a 18-year-old man diagnosed with PDD presenting auto-aggressive behaviour non-responding to neuroleptic medication. The symptoms began when he was 14-year-old. Clinical evaluation showed recurrent episode of excessive hyperactivity and severe auto mutilation, such as biting himself. PET imaging with F-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) was performed for epilepsy work-up. Results PET Imaging showed a focal hypo metabolic lesion in the right temporo-parietal region, highly suggestive for an epileptic focus. Treatment with anti-epileptic medication was initiated and 2 weeks later the self injurious behaviour disappeared with no recurrence 12 months later. Conclusions Evaluation of more cases of this subset of PDD patients with epilepsy presenting as behaviour disorders by 18F-FDG PET may suggest a possible role in determining an epileptic focus and might in addition potentially help to monitor treatment response.",

Absent to decreased responses were associated with (1) a \"pandevelopmental retardation\" involving physical growth as well as postural-motor and visualmotor development, (2) an \"abnormally quiet\" state in the first month, and (3) failures of bimanual integration between 4 and 6 months.

It is suggested that the essential, clinical, dynamic, and structural features of the depressive character are: (1) consistently low self-esteem and a sense of helplessness, dependent object relations and chronic guilt; (2) self-directed aggression and masochism are frequent but not invariable; (3) extensive use of the mechanism of denial is as common as the previously described obsessional defenses seen in patients subject to psychotic depression; (4) often the depressive character suffers from intense oral envy; (5) depressive character traits may help to ward off any of the basic anxieties, namely, object loss, loss of love, castration anxiety, and superego anxiety (guilt) (6) the depressive character may be similar to a number of related disorders, namely, the obsessional character, hysterical characters with a large oral component, and depressive borderline states; (7) sensitivity to loss, sadness, and fragility of self-esteem makes the depressive character especially vulnerable to regression into overt depression; (8) the persistence of oral incorporative mechanisms, ambivalent, dependent object relations, ego versus superego tension with depressive affect, and sensitivity to loss are characteristic of the ego of the depressive character.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical.

      "abstract": "Abstract Interpersonal barriers frequently stand in the way of the successful treatment of patients suffering from severe personality disorder (SPD). Often this stems from a failure to distinguish accurately between the patient's surface behavioural manifestations and his or her inner mental states. Misinterpreting the SPD patient's gross behaviour may thus result in unsuccessful clinical encounters because of the absence of empathic contact with the atient and through and beyond their SPD patients' behavioural faGades means that such patients continue to feel marginalized and misunderstood, and that staff become no wiser in understanding their patients as individuals. The SPD patient's strong negative emotion and its interpersonal behavioural concomitants may be erroneously equated with no progress, deterioration, or even ‘badness’ and his or her compliant behaviour may be mistaken for therapeutic progress and psychological change. Clinical decisions regarding the discharge or transfer of SPD patients, based on such grounds, are likely to be unsafe. If staff recognize SPD patients' profound problems in identifying and communication their painful mental states, they are better able to help them to give up the self-defeating and anti-social coping strategies and defences that are erected by patients in order to deal with such states. Via the removal of such barriers, some SPD patients may be freed from a metaphorical ‘prison’, which is only partly of their own making. Clinical material from some of Henderson Hospital's SPD inpatients is presented to exemplify the behavioural camouflage assumed by such patients thereby masking their inner states and the consequent interpersonal difficulties encountered in their treatment. Aspects of the therapeutic community (TC) method of idenufying and analysing the difficulties, in particular the availability and use of the ‘social reality’ of the setting, are discussed. Implications for other, non-TC, inpatient settings are considered so that the ‘social reality’ found therein can be put to greater therapeutic use.",

The illness affects approximately 1% of the population. It usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and causes significant difficulties in cognition and affect at work, in social relationships, and in self-care. Its course varies across individuals, with many patients’ symptoms responding to medicine. There are many theories of the disorder’s pathophysiology, with several mechanisms invoked to account for evidence ranging from impaired performance on neuropsychological tests to brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter alterations such as in the dopamine, glutamate, and GABA systems. The etiology of schizophrenia is complex, with both genetic and environmental risk factors. While there exist other psychotic syndromes with a number of similarities, schizophrenia can be understood as a severe, persistent, and debilitating mental illness that still requires a more thorough investigation of its causal mechanisms to improve patients’ lives.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

      "abstract": "The aim of this analysis was to highlight the significance of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive mood disorders in older adults, as well as to expand the knowledge of social educators and geragogists regarding the basic symptoms of depression. Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Suicide is a traumatic event for close relatives due to various factors, with bullying acting as a mediator. Bullying has been identified as a primary predictor of suicidal ideation and a contributing factor to suicide. Objective: This study aims to describe the pathway from bullying victimization to suicidal attempts in adolescents. Results: Adolescence is a period of peak physical health and a time of behavioral and emotional problems due to developmental factors, which can increase susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Adolescents who experience bullying report suicidal ideation more frequently, often on a weekly basis, due to psychiatric morbidity (OR = 7.78). The relationship between bullying and suicide is mediated by poor physical and mental health, especially among victims. Bullying victimization triggers psychological or behavioral problems that can lead to suicidal behavior, often mediated by mental health or psychological problems, such as internalization or substance use which serve as maladaptive coping strategies, with suicide ultimately becoming a final coping strategy. Conclusion: Psychological or mental health problems mediate the risk of suicidal attempts among bullied adolescents, although other pathways may also be involved.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Across the Life Span",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Borderline personality disorder is characterized by affective dysregulation, intense, unstable interpersonal relationships, impulsivity and unstable identity. It overlaps considerably with both PTSD and bipolar spectrum disorders. Research on true late-life BPD is limited, but suggests that some of the core features of BPD including interpersonal difficulties, unstable affect and anger remain relatively unchanged, while impulsivity and identity disturbance decline or change their mode of expression in late life. Diagnosis of BPD in late life requires flexible application of the standard diagnostic criteria as well as a thorough longitudinal history. The etiology of BPD is best explained as a combination of genetic, neurobiological vulnerability combined with childhood trauma, abuse or neglect that leads to dysregulated emotions, distorted cognitions, social skills deficits, and few adaptive coping strategies. Treatment options include pharmacotherapy (especially mood stabilizers, SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics) and psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on distress tolerance, affective regulation, changing distorted beliefs, and introducing new social and relationship problem-solving skills (especially Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Schema Focused Cognitive Therapy). In late-life care environments, such as nursing homes and other residential facilities, staff need to be empowered to set appropriate limits on problematic behavior while maintaining empathy and validating the painful affect patients often experience.

One type of phobia that is quite common but often not seriously realized is acrophobia, which is an excessive fear of heights. This disorder not only affects the psychological aspect, but also affects the daily activities of the individual who experiences it. Students as an early adult age group are in a challenging transition period, both academically and socially. When students experience acrophobia, not only is their mental condition disturbed, but also the potential for limitations in participating in certain activities such as field trips, organizations, or outdoor activities that involve heights. In the context of higher education that demands independence and courage, this type of phobia can be an obstacle to students' self-development.",

Psychogenesis is doubtful in cooperative patients from whom an initiating conflict-situation cannot be evaluated, if the time of onset does not relate to onset of symptoms, even if the pattern of symptoms seem to correlate with the structure of personality. 2. If a patient is too readily convinced of an exclusively mental source of his problems, one has to be aware of to deal with mechanisms called \"inhibition of bodily threat\" or \"inhibition of death\".

      "abstract": "Child abuse has been rarely discussed in the Russian literature. Several booklets were published in the period 1990-2016 but today the topic is largely avoided. Physical abuse may be implicated in pathogenesis of various conditions including obsessive-compulsive, autism spectrum and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. Child abuse can have long-lasting consequences also for initially typical individuals. Children regularly punished for impulsivity, hyperactivity or hysteric behavior would modify it to avoid repeated trauma or to cope with it. The adaptive or maladaptive conduct may be obsessivecompulsive and/or compatible with autism spectrum disorder: impaired communication, abnormal eye contact, stereotypies. Some repetitive behaviors seen in autism can be described as obsessive/ compulsive. Among others, binge eating and alcohol drinking may be compulsive. In conditions of collectivism and social pressure to be \"normal\" like everybody, individuals with communication abnormalities have motives to contact with peers to avoid stigmatization as outsiders. Binge drinking is used by some adolescents to overcome communication barriers. Besides, loitering with drinking companies is a way of escape from domestic violence. In conclusion, child abuse can modify behavior and trajectories of some conditions giving rise to atypical conduct more or less compatible with autism spectrum or obsessive-compulsive disorders, sometimes predisposing to excessive alcohol consumption.",

These situations are associatively connected to the past but the patient is unaware of the connection. Acting out has to be differentiated from other neurotic actions which occur during analysis. In particular it has to be differentiated from symptomatic actions and abreaction experiences. Acting out differs from symptomatic actions in that the symptomatic act is ego alien and usually refers to part of a past situation. Acting out occurs very frequently during analysis. It should be remembered, however, that it also occurs outside the realm of psychoanalysis, but then it is not available for investigation and interpretation. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of acting out during the course of analysis is bound up with the transference.",

On the other hand, patients with social anxiety disorder show excessive self-focused attention and negatively distorted self-beliefs, which may be related to frontoparietal attentional network dysfunctions during self-face processing. The core pathology of these disorders in self-face processing may be defective self-other discrimination in schizophrenia and excessively negative self-imagery in social anxiety disorder.

Objectives Claiming the concept of paraphrenia as a clinical entity with its own phenomenological characteristics included in chronic psychotic disorders. Aims To keep in mind classic psychopathology, not included in current code list, such as ICD and DSM. Methods A 40-year-old woman with good premorbid adaptation, no previous history of mental disorder. Her first psychotic symptoms appeared at 30, not because drug effect. Father diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Among her first internment, her mood was persistently elevated, expansive and easily irritable. She had bizarre megalomaniac delusions of grandeur, which combined with erotomanic ideas felt as ego-syntonic, supported by auditive hallucinations. There were no other symptoms found in manic episodes in previous historical of affective descompensations. Results Antipsychotics only had effect in mood, which turned euthymic.

      "title": "Pathways to schizophrenia: the impact of environmental factors",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is an aetiologically complex disorder arising from the interaction of a range of factors acting at various stages of life. Schizophrenic individuals inherit genes that cause structural brain deviations which may be compounded by early environmental insults. As a result some pre-schizophrenic children exhibit subtle developmental delays, cognitive problems, or poor interpersonal relationships. They are susceptible to dysregulation of dopamine, the final pathway leading to the onset of a psychotic illness. Dopamine dysregulation may arise through a process of sensitization, which, in animals, can be caused by repeated administration of dopamine-releasing drugs. It is clear that the same process occurs in humans, and that some individuals are particularly sensitive to the effects of such drugs for either genetic reasons or through early environmental damage. Stress has also been shown to induce dopamine release in animal studies, and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that social stresses can precipitate schizophrenia. Thus, stresses, such as drug use and social adversity, in adolescence or early adult life may propel the neurodevelopmentally impaired individual over a threshold into frank psychosis.",

It is not impulsive, but the result of long-standing conflicts, usually involving difficulties with male identity and inability to cope with sexual drives. Schizophrenics usually act under the influence of delusions and hallucinations. The medical and social attitudes to self-castration are never unequivocal. There are 60 case reports in the psychiatric literature. We describe a 35-year-old schizophrenic who castrated himself.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Schizophrenia is a psychiatric illness with lifetime prevalence of 1.4%. the prevalence of psychosis in deaf and mute is almost equivalent to the general population. Almost 50% deaf and mute patients diagnosed with psychosis report “hearing of voices which others cannot hear” in the absence of any external stimulus. Similar percentage of patients report visual and tactile hallucinations. The assessment of psychosis in such patients become difficult due to lack of tools and training of medical professionals in communication with such patients. There exists some literature which shows association in the neurobiology of auditory hallucinations and hearing impairment. The following case report illustrates a case of psychosis in a deaf and mute patient CASE REPORT A 17 years old unmarried female, not formally educated, unemployed, deaf and mute since birth with easy premorbid temperament no history of any comorbid illness and no family history of any psychiatric or neurological illness presented with insidious onset continuous course of total duration since last 1 year characterized by verbal and physical aggression, suspiciousness, muttering to self, hearing of voices that others cannot hear, odd behaviour, poor self care, decreased sleep. Patient was admitted due to unmanageability at home. On mental status examination, patient was agitated, violent towards herself and her family members. She was started on antipsychotic and had a good response on treatment. CONCLUSION This case illustrates the presense of psychotic symptoms including auditory hallucinations in a congenital deaf and mute patient.",

Before the discovery of antipsychotic drugs (neuroleptics) in the 1950s, there were no effective treatments for schizophrenia. In the 1970s it was widely recognized that patients with schizophrenia would be much better off if they were not kept for decades in large institutions. Where possible, new patients were discharged from hospital promptly, following assessment and treatment. There has been much discussion in the medical and the national press of the success or otherwise of ‘care in the community’.",

The first symptoms of the disease usually manifest between ages 20 and 30. The diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and its subtypes are characterized in detail in ICD-10. Diagnosis is based primarily on the presence of productive symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations occurring for at least one month which cannot be explained in another way. Schizophrenia is a disease which largely affects social functioning of patients, such as occupational performance, family life, interpersonal relationships or housing situation. Apart from the sociological aspect, social lives of schizophrenia sufferers are significantly impoverished due to cognitive impairment associated with improper functioning of NMDA receptors. The study describes a case of a patient suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which sheds light on the social functioning of this group of patients.",

Although tic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, systematic study of individuals with tic disorders dates from the nineteenth century. In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties. Scientific opinion has been divided on how broadly to conceive the spectrum of maladaptive behaviors associated with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) (Comings, 1988; Shapiro et al., 1988).",

The theme of this paper is the differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia. Schneiderian first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia are common in dissociative disorders, especially in dissociative identity disorder (DID). Many DID patients have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenics and treated with neuroleptics. We compared and examined Schneiderian symptoms of schizophrenia and those of dissociative disorders from a structural viewpoint. In dissociative disorders, delusional perception and somatic passivity are not seen. \"Lateness\" and \"Precedence of the Other\" originated from the concept of \"Pattern Reversal\" (H. Yasunaga)\" is characteristic of schizophrenia. It is important to check these basic structure of schizophrenia in subjective experiences in differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the degree of culpability of an individual who has committed an anti-social act is sometimes associated with great difficulties. A variety of factors may enter into the solution of this problem. An illegal act may be committed accidentally or unexpectedly and independently of the individual's will. It may be committed under an unavoidable necessity, such as in cases of protection of ones self or ones family. It may be committed under the influence of extreme passion or anger, when consciousness becomes blurred and cerebral inhibition is obliterated. It may be committed by insane individuals whose delusional ideas, accompanied or not by hallucinatory images, develop morbid impulses or deliberate and well planned criminal tendencies. Finally, illegal acts may be committed by individuals who, though not insane in the strict sense of the word, are nevertheless different from normal individuals by their power of reasoning, by their sentiments, tastes, sympathies, etc. To this class belongs the large category of psychopathic individuals, and also the mental defectives. The discussion of the underlying psychological moments of each of these groups of individuals is comprised in an extensive literature. We will be concerned exclusively with the medico-legal relation of the latter group alone. In order to ascertain the degree of legal responsibility of mental defectives, it is necessary first to emphasize the characteristic clinical features of mental deficiency. In considering all varieties of deviation from normal in the psychic sphere we find a long scale beginning with mental monstrosities and ending with slight mental feebleness. When the intellectual powers are involved in their entirety we deal with idiocy. When the arrest of mental development is only incomplete and is, therefore, compatible with the existence of some intellectual manifestations, we deal with imbecility. There are also individuals in whom only certain powers are likely to reach a degree of development; in whom there is no general, but only partial defect of intellectual powers. For example, one will show a meager power of intellectual acquisition, in another the power of judgment is defective; another is incapable of acquiring ele-",

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Those who suffer from attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) find it difficult to direct their emotions in order to solve challenges or problems. This alteration in emotional self-regulation implies greater disability than that attributed to the traditional dimensions -attention deficit and hyperactivity- with an evident impact on the development of personality.To review how the confluence of poor self-regulatory skills, emotion awareness and autonomy, and a particular temperament profile increase the risk of children diagnosed with ADHD for the development of a range of adjustment problems in childhood and adolescence.The typical temperamental profile of children with ADHD is characterised by high emotional reactivity and poor self-regulatory skills. The effects of the interaction of emotionality and temperament in ADHD can be either direct on the child himself or indirect on the environment, interactional by fitting or mismatch with environmental expectations, and transactional due to their dynamic relation with other characteristics in the child's environment.The confluence of poor self-regulation skills, emotion awareness and autonomy, and a temperament profile with a higher novelty seeking and lower persistence increase the risk of children diagnosed with ADHD for the development of a series of adjustment and adaptation problems in childhood and adolescence.Emocionalidad y temperamento en el trastorno por deficit de atencion con o sin hiperactividad.Introduccion. Existe en el trastorno por deficit de atencion con o sin hiperactividad (TDAH) una dificultad para dirigir las emociones para resolver retos o problemas. Esta alteracion en la autorregulacion emocional implica mayor discapacidad que las atribuidas a las dos dimensiones tradicionales, deficit de atencion e hiperactividad, con un impacto notorio sobre el desarrollo de la personalidad. Objetivo. Revisar como la confluencia de pobres habilidades de autorregulacion, conciencia y autonomia emocional, y un perfil de temperamento determinado potencian el riesgo de los niños diagnosticados con TDAH para el desarrollo de una diversidad de problemas de ajuste en la infancia y la adolescencia. Desarrollo. El perfil temperamental tipico de los niños con TDAH se caracteriza por una alta reactividad emocional y pobres habilidades de autorregulacion. Los efectos de la interaccion de la emocionalidad y el temperamento en el TDAH pueden ser directos en el propio niño o indirectos sobre el entorno, de interaccion por encaje o desajuste con las expectativas ambientales y transaccionales por su relacion dinamica con otras caracteristicas del entorno del menor. Conclusiones. La confluencia de pobres habilidades de autorregulacion, conciencia y autonomia emocional, y un perfil de temperamento con una busqueda de la novedad mas elevada y persistencia mas baja potencian el riesgo de los niños diagnosticados con TDAH para el desarrollo de una serie de problemas de ajuste y adaptacion en la infancia y la adolescencia.",

      "title": "Emotional Aspects of the Respirator Care of Patients with Poliomyelitis",
      "abstract": "Summary A study is reported of a group of patients with respiratory paralysis resulting from poliomyelitis and necessitating care in a special Respirator Unit. Although the nature of the illness, the consequent handicaps, and the special form of treatment appear to exercise a definite influence on the adjustment of the individual patient, the personality structure prior to the illness seems to be the most important single determinant in this regard. Other variables, such as the age level or level of psychosexual development at the time of onset of illness, immediately antecedent experiences, the meaning of the illness in terms of punishment or castration as well as possible secondary gain, the attitudes of parents or relatives, and cultural factors such as the stigma of dependency and socioeconomic pressures appeared as well to play significant roles. In spite of individual variations, a consistent pattern of reaction to the illness exists, varying in degree but little in nature. Regression, a common phenomenon in any illness, is marked and is fostered by the almost absolute physical dependence of the patients. Infantile mechanisms of adaptation such as denial, projection, and the use of primitive fantasy are used to cope with anxiety. With normal sexual outlets abolished, pregenital forms of gratification assume prominence. In accepting reality, patients go through one or several periods of depression of varying intensity, often followed by irritable and demanding behavior. Attitudes of family, and of staff as family surrogates, are especially important at this time, as patients tend to interpret illness as punishment for primitive instinctual impulses. Tolerance to and mechanisms of handling of dependence vary widely in different patients, with greater conflicts apparent in those who had experienced difficulties in adaptation prior to illness. The ease of weaning a patient from the tank respirator or from any other form of respiratory aid appears to be intimately connected with his current emotional state, his personality structure, and with the attitudes of the ward personnel. Intercurrent happenings on the ward tend to assume the proportion of \"crises,\" and often seem to produce relapses, both physical and emotional in nature. Preliminary studies have shown significant interrelationships between respiratory function and emotional state. More detailed studies in this area are being organized on a multidisciplinary basis. Material is discussed regarding the attainment of optimal attitudes and techniques of management by ward personnel. Preliminary conclusions in relation to the type of psychiatric techniques most appropriate for such patients are summarized. Psychotherapeutic procedures seem to be of value in: Handling anxiety, furthering acceptance of disability by patients, and promoting healthy striving towards independence within the limits imposed by the disease; Fostering more constructive attitudes toward patients by families through discussion of feelings, particularly guilt and resentment; Helping ward personnel to operate more effectively through understanding the patients' needs and their own reactions to the patients. Observations on group behavior and patient-staff relationships are reported. The need for further investigation is stressed, with particular regard to the acute phases of illness and the adjustment of patients following discharge.",

      "abstract": "One-third of children with T1D experience anxiety related to specific aspects of living with T1D, including social anxiety, fear of hypoglycemia, anxiety related to uptake of new technology, and needle anxiety or avoidance. Rates of social anxiety may be higher in young people with T1D compared with their peers without T1D. Social anxiety in young people with T1D is often specifically related to social aspects of T1D, includ-ing others learning or knowing that the person has T1D, completing T1D-related tasks in front of other people or in public places, answering questions or talking about T1D, experiencing judgment about T1D, managing or communicating about T1D in dating situations, or having symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in front of other people. Social anxiety disorder, in which youth experience anxiety in a wide range of social situations and diabetes-specific social anxiety may or may not co-occur. It may be necessary to distinguish among clinically elevated of anxiety, developmentally appropriate concerns about privacy, and secrecy. Privacy involves a preference to complete T1D-related tasks without an audience or avoid attention from others, whereas secrecy involves actively hiding T1D and its man-agement from others, which may negatively affect daily T1D self-management and well-being. Youth may prefer privacy but be willing to complete T1D self-management tasks in the presence of others when necessary. To avoid the development of anxiety, young people with T1D may need to practice completing T1D-related tasks in the presence of others. People who experience high anxiety or who engage in secrecy likely delay or avoid engaging in T1D self-management tasks and may benefit from intervention to address concerns and behaviors that interfere with optimal T1D management. Treating T1D-specific social anxiety is important to minimize suboptimal T1D outcomes and improve quality of life. Treatment for social anxiety disorder and T1D-specific social anxiety both respond best to cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention.",

Asperger syndrome (AS)4 is a subgroup on the autistic spectrum. People with AS share many of the same features as are seen in autism, but with no history of language delay and with an IQ in the average range or above. In this editorial, the main cognitive theories of autism are summarised. These are then followed by a summary of the key neurobiological findings.\n\nThe mind blindness theory of autism5 proposed that in autism spectrum conditions there are deficits in the normal process of empathy, relative to mental age. These deficits can occur by degrees. The term “empathising” encompasses a range of other terms: “theory of mind”, “mind reading”, “empathy”, and taking the “intentional stance”.6 Empathy involves two major elements: (1) the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others, as a natural way to make sense of agents,7–9 and (2) having an emotional reaction that is appropriate to the other person’s mental state (such as sympathy).\n\nSince the first test of mind blindness in children with autism,10 there have been more than 30 experimental tests. The vast majority of these have revealed profound impairments in the development of their empathising ability. These are reviewed elsewhere.5,11 Some children and adults with AS only show their empathising deficits on age appropriate adult tests.12–14 This deficit in their empathising is thought to underlie …",

      "abstract": "Common risk factors for the receipt of disability income (DI) are psychiatric diagnosis at the time of conscription, showing low personal responsibility and job satisfication, unemployment after graduation, low rating on an IQ test, low educational level, part-time employment, isolation, separation, smoking, problem drinking, poor subjective state of health and well-being. Psychiatric diagnoses are considered to be the main reason for disability income in women and rank third in men. With average retirement age of 39 for males and 42 for females, schizophrenia is the most important single reason for early retirement before age 40. Major depression has been shown to be the fourth leading cause of DI worldwide. Personality disorders, which display primarily antisocial, histrionic, emotionally unstable and narcissistic behaviour (Cluster B personality disorders) have been associated with an earlier age of work disability, and borderline personality has been associated with failure to return to work. A dependent, schizoid, paranoid and antisocial personality tends to be associated with an increased risk of developing disability. A subtype of adaptation disorder that is characterised primarily by lasting embitterment after exceptional life events, which violate basic beliefs, namely post-traumatic embitterment disorder, shows up highly the development of DI. However, most of the patients applying for a DI have neither been sufficiently diagnosed nor received adequate psychiatric and/or psychotherapeutic treatment when they claim on their DI policy. Thus, the prognosis of the diseases listed above could well be improved at least for some patients depending on their disease (10-80 %).",

This chapter also discusses how to differentiate BDD from normal appearance concerns and from problematic preoccupation with obvious physical defects. BDD is commonly misdiagnosed as another mental disorder. Sometimes misdiagnosis occurs because patients are too embarrassed and ashamed to reveal their appearance concerns; in such cases, BDD symptoms that are more readily observable (such as social anxiety) may be assigned an incorrect diagnosis while BDD goes undetected. In other cases, BDD symptoms are recognized but are misdiagnosed as another disorder. BDD must be differentiated from other conditions so appropriate treatment can be instituted.",

      "abstract": "A 60-year-old, right-handed woman, with no focal brain lesions, suffered from a progressive impairment in recognising people of personal relevance and public figures familiar to her in the premorbid period. The patient did not suffer from general cognitive deterioration. There was no ecological or clear psychometric evidence of visuoperceptual or visuospatial deficits. Her defective person recognition was not overcome by extra-facial (e.g., observing animated people in their usual surroundings) or extra-visual information (e.g., listening to the voice). Moreover, presenting the correct name in the presence of an unrecognised familiar person failed to prompt her familiarity judgement, or retrieval of the relevant biographical knowledge. The patient also had some recognition difficulties with famous buildings and songs as well as with some common objects. It is argued that the patient's difficulty in identifying familiar people was the consequence of progressive loss of stored exemplars of familiar persons and perhaps also of some other \"unique items\" (famous songs and monuments) in an independent subsystem of semantics that we term \"exemplar semantics.\" We discuss the associative (semantic) nature and specificity of the deficit in person knowledge, the possible top-down negative influences of the loss of exemplars in the person recognition system, and the link between the disorders and the right/left temporal lobe.",

      "abstract": "The self-disorder model offers a unifying way of conceptualizing schizophrenia's highly diverse symptoms (positive, negative, disorganized), of capturing their distinctive bizarreness, and of conceiving their longitudinal development. These symptoms are viewed as differing manifestations of an underlying disorder of ipseity or core-self: hyper-reflexivity/diminished-self-presence with accompanying disturbances of \"grip\" or \"hold\" on reality. Recent revision to this phenomenological theory, in particular distinguishing primary-vs-secondary factors, offers a bio-pheno-social model that is consistent with recent empirical findings and offers several advantages: (1) It helps account for the temporal variations of the symptoms or syndrome, including longitudinal progression, but also the shorter-term, situationally reactive, and sometimes defensive or quasi-intentional variability of symptom-expression that can occur in schizophrenia (consistent with understanding some aspects of ipseity-disturbance as dynamic and mutable, involving shifting attitudes or experiential orientations). (2) It accommodates the overlapping of some key schizophrenic symptoms with certain nonschizophrenic conditions involving dissociation (depersonalization, derealization), including depersonalization disorder and panic disorder, thereby acknowledging both shared and distinguishing symptoms. (3) It integrates recent neurocognitive and neurobiological as well as psychosocial (eg, influence of trauma and culture) findings into a coherent but multi-factorial neuropsychological account. An adequate model of schizophrenia will postulate shared disturbances of core-self experiences that nevertheless can follow several distinct pathways and occur in various forms. Such a model is preferable to uni-dimensional alternatives—whether of schizophrenia or ipseity-disturbance—given its ability to account for distinctive yet varying experiential and neurocognitive abnormalities found in research on schizophrenia, and to integrate these with recent psychosocial and neurobiological findings.",

      "abstract": "Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a rare variant of adult-onset schizophrenia. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia typically have a more chronic course of illness, greater cognitive impairment, increased negative symptoms, and more severe social consequences than patients with adult-onset schizophrenia. Misdiagnosis of childhood-onset schizophrenia is common, but certain clinical features, such as predominant negative symptoms and premorbid developmental abnormalities, can help to differentiate the disorder from other psychiatric disorders in childhood. Treatment regimens that include both pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions are needed to comprehensively treat children and adolescents with schizophrenia.",

      "title": "STRESS AND CRISIS IN THE FAMILY IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM AND DOWN SYNDROME",
      "abstract": "The concept of took shape in the 1920's and 40's. Canner's original concept differs from current interpretations. It is associated with schizophrenia, with schizoid manifestations, associated as a consequence of violation of vital instincts. During this period, serious diagnostic problems were created by the fact that non-ambiguous terms such as autism, autistic disorder, autistic autistic thinking, autistic behavior were used as synonyms.One of the social factors influencing the development and deepening of autism is the blind faith in the abilities of these children. Another factor is the widespread perception that autism is a disease and, even more frightening, that there is no cure for it. Parents begin to lose their sense of life and stop fighting and trying different treatments and therapeutic methods. They do not want to go out with other people and thus isolate the child from contact with other children. This is especially true of people of higher social status and who are pessimistic about the child's condition.Down syndrome is the most common form of mental retardation and the most common genetic cause of developmental disability. It is not a disease. People with Down Syndrome are not sick with an incurable disease, they are not affected by this syndrome, they are not victims.Many parents of such children coexist in constant conflicts and accusations. They waste valuable time finding fault for what happened in others and in themselves. Fear, anger, aggression, resentment, helplessness, the child suffers the most.Another reason why parents are dramatically alienated from one another is when one of them embarks on a mission in their life raising the child, neglecting or completely forgetting the needs for attention and affection of their partner and healthy child (sibling). As a result of this overprotection, the microclimate suffers, affecting everyone in the family and reflecting on the child's achievements with disabilities.The article presents the results of a study of stress in parents of children with special educational needs (autism and Down syndrome). The PSI-4 Parental Stress Index assesses the level of the parent-child system and focuses on three main areas of stress: child characteristics, parent characteristics, and life stress. The study participants were 9 males and 21 females with a mean age of 47 years. Of these, 51.6% have tertiary education and 48.4% have secondary education.It was found that women cope better with stress (70.96%) than men (29.03%). With the age of the parents, the level of family stress increases from 48.38% to 51.6%. Parents of children with higher social status are more likely to have problem children.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a severe mental health condition that can be debilitating for a person's well-being. It is characterized by disturbances in perception, emotional regulation and thought processes, including symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, leading to a disconnection from reality. Patients often suffer when trying to meet the demands of ordinary life. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in development of psychosis. Besides these, there are also environmental influences, which contribute as a trigger and later progression of psychotic disorders. These external determinants could possibly be managed in attempts to contain the problem of increased mental health conditions with the main psychotic component. This article reviews the literature reports of current environmental risk factors of psychosis. The keyword used was “psychosis” searched alone or in combination with “risk factors”, “environmental factors” or “external factors”.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "title": "Maladaptive daydreaming should be included as a dissociative disorder in psychiatric manuals: position paper",
      "abstract": "Maladaptive daydreaming is a distinct syndrome in which the main symptom is excessive vivid fantasising that causes clinically significant distress and functional impairment in academic, vocational and social domains. Unlike normal daydreaming, maladaptive daydreaming is persistent, compulsive and detrimental to one’s life. It involves detachment from reality in favour of intense emotional engagement with alternative realities and often includes specific features such as psychomotor stereotypies (e.g. pacing in circles, jumping or shaking one’s hands), mouthing dialogues, facial gestures or enacting fantasy events. Comorbidity is common, but existing disorders do not account for the phenomenology of the symptoms. Whereas non-specific therapy is ineffective, targeted treatment seems promising. Thus, we propose that maladaptive daydreaming be considered a formal syndrome in psychiatric taxonomies, positioned within the dissociative disorders category. Maladaptive daydreaming satisfactorily meets criteria for conceptualisation as a psychiatric syndrome, including reliable discrimination from other disorders and solid interrater agreement. It involves significant dissociative aspects, such as disconnection from perception, behaviour and sense of self, and has some commonalities with but is not subsumed under existing dissociative disorders. Formal recognition of maladaptive daydreaming as a dissociative disorder will encourage awareness of a growing problem and spur theoretical, research and clinical developments.",

The violent group reported significantly higher levels of neurotic symptoms than the non-violent group, and were more socially deviant.

      "abstract": "1. With the exception of degenerative and epileptic psychoses, there exists in the literature a tendency to group together psychoses of infancy and early childhood, which may represent different illness processes, or to differentiate between them in accordance with concepts which are difficult to apply clinically. 2. Autistic defenses are generally characteristic of these psychoses. But this does not justify a failure to differentiate between types which can be distinguished clinically. Such differentiation would appear advisable until knowledge concerning etiology increases. 3. It is suggested that the diagnosis of \"autistic psychosis\" be applied only to cases meeting Kanner's criteria of early infantile autism. 4. The diagnosis of \"schizophrenic illness\" should be applied to cases with onset after age one and with a picture characterized principally by loss of affective contact with reality and autistic thinking. 5. Psychoses in children with retarded motor development, or in whom intellectual performance, although atypical for any age level, is below normal functioning in all areas, would best be classified for the present in a separate group as psychoses in mentally defective children. 6. With the exception of rarely occurring affective psychoses in this age group, and with the exception of organic and epileptic psychoses, most psychoses of infancy and early childhood will meet the criteria of one of these types. Cases characteristic of 3 types have been presented. 7. The degree of impairment of communication present in these psychoses constitutes a significant prognostic factor.",

People become mentally ill, insane, or psychotic and a few such individuals in a society can destroy its fabric. People can become addicted to drugs. They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that involves impairment in three broad areas as identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition [1]: socialization, communication, and repetitive or restricted behaviors and interests. With regard to socialization, individuals with autism may show limited use of nonverbal behaviors, such as eye contact or facial expressions directed to others. They may demonstrate limited social and emotional reciprocity, may not seek to share their enjoyment of activities and interests with others, and often fail to develop appropriate peer relationships. In the area of communication, individuals with autism may have a significant language delay and have difficulties with symbolic play. Those individuals with strong verbal skills still tend to have communication impairments, including difficulty with reciprocal conversation, and use of unusual or repetitive language. Finally, in the area of restricted and repetitive behaviors, individuals with autism may show a preoccupation with parts of objects (e.g. repeatedly spinning the wheel of a toy car), or an intense preoccupation with an unusual topic of interest (e.g. radiators, train schedules). In some individuals, these areas of interest become almost all-consuming, such that it is difficult for them to relate to others without bringing up their preoccupation. Individuals with autism often show a need for routine and predictability, and may exhibit ritualistic behavior or become upset by disruptions in their usual routine. Finally, some individuals with autism exhibit repetitive movements, such as hand-flapping or body-rocking.",

Depression and anxiety frequently coexist, and generalized anxiety disorder may precede a major depression. Most mood disorders are dealt with at the level of primary care. The current understanding and clinical approach to them is dominated by a model derived from psychiatry, where there are significant differences in patient population and priorities from those in family practice.

      "abstract": "The problems of diagnosis, pathogenesis, aetiology and successful treatment of the idiopathic schizophrenias is one of the most urgent and formidable ones which psychiatry has still to tackle. It is most urgent because of the large number of sufferers struck by the disease, made unfit for a successful life at an early age, and the distress imposed on them and their relatives. It is most formidable because our essential knowledge of the nature of this disease, or possibly group of diseases, is scanty and disorderly and opinions are conflicting and contradictory. This unsatisfactory state is made worse by the fact that there is quite an amount of disagreement on diagnosis, so that often the findings of different workers do not refer to comparable groups of patients (and conditions in which they are examined) which must add to the confusion, particularly when metabolic examinations are carried out. Too often “marginal psychoses“, and also not rarely, paranoid hallucinatory states with and without changes of the personality are called “schizophrenia”. The last-named states are not infrequently schizophrenoid reactions (or reactions of a schizoid person) to psychogenic causes or to potentially diagnosable physical disorders. On close clinical examination one would also find that the symptomatology of such cases is not that of idiopathic schizophrenia. In the “classical” schizophrenias of Kraepelin, Bleuler and Kleist, despite some discrepancies, the typical para-functions of feeling, willing, thinking and activity, usually accompanied by hallucinations, mainly auditory, and paranoid delusions are present and also a disturbance of the albumin/globulin ratio in C.S.F. and serum. In the absence of this mental and physical symptomatology the diagnosis of idiopathic schizophrenia should not be made (Fleischhacker et al. (7, 8)).",

      "abstract": "is a culture-bound syndrome in Baluchestan, Iran. Experts believe that dissociation theory is more suitable for providing a psychopathological description of this syndrome in this region. In addition, they highlight need for investigating its pathology, particularly role of factors such as traumatic and abuse experiences during childhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to 4th edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (1), the essential feature of dissociative disorders is a disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic. According to DSM-IV-TR, dissociative disorders include: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue and unspecified dissociative disorder. A dissociate disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disorder that includes a dissociative symptom (i.e. disturbance in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment), that does not meet criteria for any specific dissociative disorder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to DSM a dissociative state may be defined as a dissociative trance disorder that includes a possession or trance state. Dissociative trance disorder is a single or episodic disturbance in state of consciousness, identity, or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures. Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one’s control. Possession trance involves replacement of customary sense of personal identity or a new identity, attributed to influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, and is associated with stereotyped “involuntary” movements or amnesia. It is probably most prevalent dissociative disorder in Asia. The dissociative or trance disorder is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.\r\n\r\nMany culture-related syndromes, such as amok, bebainan, latah, pibloktoq, ataque de nervios and possession, shin-byung, enchantment, lack of spirit, Zar and djinnati (2, 3), are considered as dissociative disorders. Culture-bound syndromes include a set of psychological phenomena that are of interest to psychologists and psychiatrists. The eclectic nature of this syndrome has made it difficult to have a precise definition. Thus, deciding on a specific definition has been controversial. According to DSM, term culture-bound syndrome denotes a locality-specific pattern and repetition of an aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be illnesses, or at least afflictions that mostly have local names. Culture-bound syndromes do not one-by-one match routine diagnostic system diseases. Most of these syndromes were initially reported as an issue specific to a certain culture or a relevant set, or geographically-related to original culture (4).\r\n\r\nThe term Djinnati is a culture-bound syndrome, widely known by that name in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchestan (3, 5). Based on clinical observations, this syndrome was introduced by Bakhshani and Kianpoor in Baluchestan, Iran (6). A new study by Bakhshani et al. (3) on a rural population in Baluchestan showed total prevalence of 0.5% and 1.03% among rural population and women of that population, respectively. Common symptoms of this disorder include disruption in consciousness, memory and stereotyped behaviors such as laughing, crying, speaking incomprehensibly, which are attributed to a new identity known as Djinn. Attacks usually begin with pain, irritation and sometimes limb paralysis. In some groups, loss of speech and in some other cases, speaking in different languages and change in speaking rhythm and tone of voice have been reported. In addition, there was a partial and rarely complete amnesia during attack. Some patients were far beyond their physical strength. In addition, lack of control and harming themselves and others, during attack, have been reported; although, injuries were not serious. Sometimes during attack, The patients express some demands and possessor (Djinn) requests for satisfying these demands. Attacks usually last from 30 minutes to two hours (3). \r\n\r\nIt seems that traumatic and abuse experiences have an essential role in initiation and maintenance of dissociative disorders (7, 8). Results from Bakhshani et al. (3) study showed that 43% of patients experienced their first attack after a traumatic accident (5). After civil war of Mozambique, based on results of a study reported by Igreja et al. (9) on 941 subjects (255 males and 686 females), trauma and civil war resulted damages, which explain high prevalence of this disorder.\r\n\r\nCastillo (10), believes that biological and psychoanalytic perspectives are not capable of explaining spirit possession. Etiologically, he suggested that spirit possession, similar to multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a spontaneous trance reaction to severe and negative events in environment (particularly child abuse). On other hand, Naring and Nijenhuis observed a significant correlation between traumatic events and possession experiences (11). In addition, Naring and Nijenhuis (11) considered dissociative identity disorder to be a consequence of childhood abuse or other traumatic events, thus support post-trauma model. In this regard, a study by Pasquini et al. (12), showed a relationship between traumatic experience in childhood and development of dissociative disorders. Kaplan et al. (13) found that those with higher score in dissociative experience scale had been more sexually abused during their childhood. They have been reported to commit further suicide and aggressive behaviors (13).\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be concluded that traumatic experiences, specifically childhood maltreatment and abuse, are related to possession and dissociative experiences. Therefore, in future studies, it is required to investigate type of cultural beliefs abuse and other environmental factors with onset of clinical signs of Djinatti, and then develop and practice preventive and therapeutic approaches, based on findings.",

      "abstract": "Vital depersonalization was observed in 59 out of 76 schizophrenic patients with the prevalence of depersonalization. Three interrelated components of vital depersonalization were distinguished. The main depersonalization component proper was manifested by the experience of estrangement and unreality of the feeling of existence (\"self\"). The second, affective one, was marked by vital fear and anxiety. The third one involved common sense disorders and was characterized by vital bodily sensations. Vital depersonalization had all the principal signs of depersonalization. However, it differed from the allo-, somato- and autotypes of depersonalization in disorders of the vital level: similarity to physical sensations, pain and vagueness. Vital depersonalization may be viewed as pathology of the first level of selfawareness--selfsence of awareness of vital ego or of body perception.",

      "abstract": "Apresentacao: A Esquizofrenia e um transtorno psiquiatrico complexo de evolucao cronica, caracterizado por uma alteracao cerebral que dificulta o correto julgamento sobre a realidade, tendo sintomas classificados como positivos (por exemplo, alucinacoes e delirios) ou negativos (dificuldades de expressar sentimentos e emocoes e pobreza no discurso). E subdividida em cinco tipos: hebefrenica, paranoide, catatonica, residual e indiferenciada. Neste estudo abordaremos a Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica. A Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, tambem conhecida como desorganizada, e caracterizada por uma acentuada regressao de comportamento, tendo como principais sinais e sintomas estao a infantilidade, discurso incoerente, enfraquecimento intelectual, perturbacao dos afetos, ideias delirantes, alucinacoes, pensamento desorganizado, gesticulacao exagerada, comportamento irresponsavel e imprevisivel, com tendencia ao isolamento social. Geralmente, comeca a ser percebida dos 15 aos 25 anos de idade. A causa ainda nao e totalmente definida, mas hoje sabe-se que se trata de uma doenca quimica cerebral que decorre de alteracoes nos varios sistemas bioquimicos, que sao os neurotransmissores, e vias neuronais cerebrais. Nessa conjuntura, o presente trabalho faz uma analise acerca do diagnostico de Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica de uma jovem assistida pelo Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juventil de Imperatriz – MA e tem por objetivo conhecer o contexto da Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, compreendendo os fatores que ocasionam influencia sobre a mesma, alem de conhecer a realidade da pessoa com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, bem como contexto familiar e alteracoes sociais que esta pode vim a causar, entender o processo de acompanhamento e tratamento da paciente realizado pela equipe multiprofissional do CAPS IJ, com destaque para a Enfermagem e elaborar problemas e intervencoes, visando a melhora na qualidade de vida da paciente. Desenvolvimento: O estudo realizado e descritivo, do tipo relato de caso, pois segundo Parente (2010), tem como caracteristica a descricao detalhada, contendo caracteristicas importantes sobre sinais, sintomas e outras caracteristicas do paciente e relata os procedimentos terapeuticos utilizados, bem como o deslanche do caso. A coleta de dados foi realizada no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juvenil - CAPS IJ, na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, no dia 27 de Setembro de 2017, com observacao da consulta de Enfermagem com a mae e revisao do prontuario da paciente, entrevista direta com a enfermeira e assistente social da unidade, e ainda com busca eletronica e literaria, incluindo artigos cientificos na lingua portuguesa, para uma abrangente revisao. Foi consultado o prontuario da mesma a fim de compreender as principais causas do ocorrido e propor intervencoes para melhor qualidade de vida. Para a construcao dos diagnosticos/problemas e intervencoes de enfermagem foi utilizado o NANDA 2015-2017 e NIC, para estudos de medicacoes utilizou-se o AME e manual da ANVISA. Resultados: Com a busca desenvolvida, acerca das informacoes e historico da paciente soube-se que a mesma possui 20 Anos, e estudante, reside na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, com pais divorciados e uma irma com 15 anos, foi diagnosticada em 2013, aos 15 anos, com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1). A mae da paciente relata que teve parto normal de 7 meses, porem laborioso – ocorrido na recepcao do hospital, tendo em decorrencia deficiencia na oxigenacao cerebral (hipoxia neonatal) e convulsao. A paciente teve crescimento retardado, veio a andar apenas com 3 anos e falou as primeiras palavras com 4 anos de idade, mas apresentava boa socializacao. Apresenta retardo mental, relata a equipe multiprofissional do CAPSIJ que ouve vozes, ve um homem com capa preta, tem delirios, convulsoes, dificuldade no controle dos esfincteres, apresenta alteracoes na compreensao, alteracoes no humor, dificuldade motora, fala desconexa, em contexto fora da realidade, relata que nunca viu o pai, informacao que, segundo a mae, nao e verdadeira. Fala em namoro, mas de forma infantilizada, grita muito, nao tem paciencia em escutar, possui baixo nivel de atencao e gosta de pintar e ouvir musicas, se ocupando assim, por vezes, durante o dia inteiro. A paciente iniciou acompanhamento apos inicio dos primeiros sintomas na Associacao de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais – APAE, tendo de inicio as seguintes hipoteses diagnosticas: Epilepsia (CID 10 G40), Retardo Mental moderado (CID 10 F71), Transtornos Mentais e Comportamentais associados ao puerperio (CID 10 F53), Transtorno Psicotico Agudo e Transitorio (CID 10 F23) e Esquizofrenia (CID 10 F20). Em seguida foi encaminhada ao CAPS IJ onde em 2013, aos 15 anos, L.G.S foi diagnosticada com Esquizofrenia do tipo Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1) e iniciou acompanhamento e tratamento com  equipe multiprofissional da Unidade, com atendimentos psiquiatrico, com nutricionista, enfermeira, assistente social e psicologa, e atualmente tambem participa de oficinas de arte e teatro, que a paciente relata que gosta, mas tem aversao aos grupos de adolescentes, pois diz que sao mais velhos e a mesma prefere se relacionar com criancas. Atualmente, tendo 20 anos e com tratamento medicamentoso, acompanhamento com equipe multiprofissional e participacao em oficinas, obteve melhora do quadro, melhora na socializacao, o que possibilitou tambem diminuicao na medicacao, passando a ser iniciado com a mesma o processo de alta da Unidade de Atendimento, com comparecimento da paciente de 15 em 15 dias para interacao social e acompanhamento com a equipe ate que esteja pronta para a alta. Fez-se levantamento das medicacoes utilizadas pela paciente e de diagnosticos de Enfermagem, como: • Atividade de recreacao deficiente, caracterizado pelo tedio, relacionado a atividades de recreacao insuficientes. confusao aguda, controle de impulsos ineficaz, comunicacao verbal prejudicada•            Interacao social prejudicada, caracterizada por funcao social prejudicada, interacao disfuncional com outras pessoas, relacionado ao conhecimento insuficiente para de como fortalecer a reciprocidade, disturbio no autoconceito, isolamento terapeutico e processos de pensamento perturbados, sindrome de estresse por mudanca, risco de automutilacao e risco de violencia direcionada a si mesmo. Fez se tambem o levantamento de intervencoes, que foram: Aplicar arteterapia, praticar musicoterapia, estipular terapia socioambiental, utilizar brinquedos terapeuticos e administrar medicacao quando prescrito. Consideracoes Finais: Em suma, o referido estudo possibilitou como ferramenta fundamental para conhecimento na pratica em relacao as principais alteracoes e especificidades de um paciente com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, trazendo um olhar critico para a importância da equipe de enfermagem nos cuidados e acompanhamento do paciente acometido, assim abrindo a concepcao para uma analise sobre a patologia, alem disso, possibilitou a capacidade de realizar uma pesquisa cientifica em bases de dados e literaria, que e primordial para a formacao academica.",

      "abstract": "After a detailed psychiatric study of 20 patients representing consecutive admissions it is concluded that, generally, emotional factors were intimately involved in ulcer perforations. However, the importance of diet, alcohol, activity, and other concurrent disease also was noted. Perforation usually occurred as a climax to a period of emotional turbulence when the patient faced situations which, consciously or unconsciously, he felt to be grossly damaging to his self-esteem and to which he reacted, predominantly, with impotent rage. The perfection prodrome is described and interpreted as a depressive equivalent. The ulcer patient's ordinal position in his family as the youngest or middle child and his difficulties in relation to his father are emphasized. Particularly where no other serious disease coexists, perforation should be taken as presumptive evidence that the patient has tried unsuccessfully to resolve an emotional crisis and that appropriate psychiatric help probably is indicated as part of the total treatment.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of depressive disorders in children and adolescents requires good and profound exploration and expertise. I have seen patients referred with the diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who have turned out to be suffering from depression. In addition, the symptoms of aggression and agitation in adolescents may serve to mask the manic or hypo-manic phase of bipolar disorder (1, 2). Addictive and affective disorders are not rare. Intake of ad-dictive drugs can be a form of self-medication. Depressive symptoms in adolescents may also indicate psychotic development, which may start with purely negative symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the increased risk of suicide during antidepressive treatment has often been biased. There is in fact growing evidence of increases in adolescent suicide because of restraints in prescription. My personal experience concerning the prescription of antidepressives to adolescents with depressive disorders has been positive. In any case, the issue of suicidal tendencies should always be addressed openly and be observed. It must be distinguished from impulses to self-injury or self-injuring behavior, for example, in post-traumatic stress disorder (reduction in stress).\r\n\r\nAdditional administration of an (atypical) neuroleptic has had favorable results in depressive disor-ders with mood fluctuations, tendency to ruminate and sleep disorders, as well as for suicidal thoughts. We are aware that treatment of depression is unpromising with drugs alone. A current study from the USA (3) demonstrates the superiority of a combination of behavioral therapy and antidepressives. In my experience, the combination of various psychotherapeutic procedures and involvement of the family system can be expedient.",

Auditory hallucinations are especially likely to swiftly be considered due to psychiatric illness. An elderly patient with chronic auditory hallucinations without other significant psychopathology nor other symptoms prompted reflection and literature review. Objectives To review differential diagnosis of auditory hallucinosis. Methods Pubmed search for terms: auditory and hallucinosis. Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1. Sensory deprivation; 2. Hearing loss, auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome; 3. Dementia, neurodegenerative disorders; 4. Brainstem lesions; 5. Other central nervous lesions: thalamus, temporal, other; 6. Epilepsy; 7. Tic disorders; 8. Alcohol use disorders; 9. Borderline personality disorder; 10. Others. Conclusions Patients presenting with auditory hallucinosis should be carefully evaluated to exclude non-psychiatric disorders.

      "title": "Autoimmune thyroid disorder and recurrent depression: Clinicians must be aware of the links",
      "abstract": "Sir, Autoimmune thyroid disorder causing hypothyroidism may be missed by clinicians in routine clinical practice if antibody testing is not carried out.[1] Hypothyroidism has been positively correlated with a diagnosis of depression, subclinical depression, and depressive features. Patients with hypothyroidism that have depression may take longer to recover, and treatment of the thyroid disorder has a direct putative role in the management of depression as well.[2] Autoimmune thyroid disorder has been linked to depression and a higher prevalence of both antimicrosomal antibodies (AMAs) and antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies have been found in patients with depression.[3] We discuss herewith a case of depression that visited our outpatient department and in the course of routine investigations and assessment was uncovered to be a case of autoimmune thyroid disorder. A 42-year-old woman presented to the psychiatry outpatient clinic with chief complaints of decreased social interactions with family members over the past 7 months before presentation. She would remain isolated and aloof, stopped pursuing her hobbies and showed signs of inactiveness and lethargy. The relatives mentioned that she became very slow in her daily chores and was unable to complete them like before. She would cry often and expressed a wish to die. There was, however, no suicidal attempt made by the patient. She would feel fatigued and complained of a delay in sleep onset though sleep was not disturbed. This was the fourth such episode in the patient, and it was the first visit to our clinic. The first episode occurred 6 years before presentation without any precipitating factors, and the symptoms were similar to those described above. Psychiatric help was sought in the first episode by a private psychiatrist, and the patient was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. She was started on escitalopram in a dose of 15 mg per day. She continued treatment for a period of 9 months and stopped medication on her own as she showed over 85% improvement. Her symptoms did not return on stopping the medication. She had a second episode 4 years before the present episode and immediately consulted the same doctor. She was restarted on escitalopram with a maximum dose of 15 mg per day. This time, too she showed over 80% improvement in 4 weeks of treatment. The patient stopped follow-up and medication in 6 months as she was better. In the second episode, she complained of oligomenorrhea that was not treated. A thyroid hormone profile done 4 years back revealed no abnormality. Within 3 weeks of stopping the medication, the patient had a relapse of symptoms with sadness, crying spells, and feeling helpless in addition to her lethargy. This time, she was started on escitalopram and venlafaxine. The patient improved to 50% after 4 weeks and continued treatment for another 10 months. This time, though compliant with treatment, the patient had a worsening of her symptoms and visited our set up. She had gained 11 kg during the previous year. An endocrinology opinion was sought from our institution, thyroid profile (free T3, T4, TSH levels) was repeated which was normal. The endocrinologist suggested getting serum anti-TPO antibody and AMA tests done. The patient tested positive for both, and it was suggested that the patient is given 25 µg of thyroxine in addition to her psychotropic medications. On follow-up, not only did the sadness abate but also fatigability, poor motivation, and lethargy decreased significantly. Her menstrual cycle was regular, and she lost 6 kg of weight while being able to do her daily chores as well as before. She has been following up and is currently asymptomatic and functioning well. She has been maintained on just escitalopram 15 mg per day and thyroxine in the morning. Our case highlights the need for screening patients with depression to rule out autoimmune thyroid disorder. Thyroid hormones may at times be reported normal in laboratory investigations and yet autoimmune processes may contribute to subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical depression. This screening is vital when symptoms do not remit with antidepressant treatment and thyroid profiles are normal while the patient shows subtle signs of hypothyroidism (in our case lethargy, fatigue, weight gain, and menstrual disturbances).[4] Subclinical hypothyroidism may produce depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits although these tend to be less severe than those produced by overt hypothyroidism. Among patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, the lifetime prevalence of depression in patients is approximately double that of the general population. A lower response rate to antidepressants or antidepressant refractoriness has been observed among patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. They also show a greater likelihood to respond to T3 augmentation as compared to euthyroid depressed patients.[5] Studies have reported a greater prevalence of antithyroid antibody titers in patients with depression, estimated at 9-25%, compared to the general population rate of approximately 5%. Around 20% of patients with depressive disorder had detectable titers of antithyroid antibodies, a rate considerably higher than the 5-10% observed in the normal population. Each of these 20% patients with symptomless autoimmune thyroiditis had normal baseline serum thyrotropin concentrations and normal thyroid function (as assessed by T4, T3 uptake, and free thyroxine index). These findings support the hypothesis of subtle thyroid dysfunction in a sizable sample of psychiatric patients with prominent depressive symptoms.[6] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Adult ADHD seems to be a reality, but much less frequent than in youths. Impulsivity, attention disorder, and emotional status are the main characters of the syndrome.

During auscultation, you noticed a few bruises in the shape of a hand and of different ages on her chest, stomach and upper arm. She also appeared timid and avoided any eye contact with you. You asked her about the bruises, and her boyfriend replied that she was careless and fell frequently.WHAT IS INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE? Intimate partner abuse is when an intimate partner inflicts violent, threatening or controlling behaviour. An intimate partner could be a current or former spouse, or a non-spouse (e.g. boyfriend, girlfriend or dating partner). Intimate partner abuse is broadly categorised into physical, sexual, emotional-psychological, economical, wrongful confinement or social isolation. It can result in direct injuries such as physical injuries and pain, or indirect injuries such as mental disorders, e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorders, generalised anxiety disorder and decline in functional or cognitive ability, low self-esteem or poor self-care.[1] Intimate partner abuse is the most common form of domestic violence in Singapore. Abuse tends to recur in a repetitive escalating pattern, with many victims not seeking help until much later, if at all. A local survey found that only 23.4% of victims reported a recent abuse incident to the police.[2] Primary care practitioners are often the first point of contact, as victims may present with related injuries or for unrelated medical consultations. They can present for reasons such as acute respiratory infections, chronic disease management or routine health screenings. With a high index of suspicion, physicians can seize these opportunities to detect such cases and enable early intervention before serious injuries or death occurs. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR ABUSE? Individual factors: The perpetrator has a history of substance abuse or interpersonal violence and certain personality traits or psychopathology, such as hostility, jealousy, a suspicious nature, anger-management issues, low self-esteem, high emotional dependency and feeling of depression. He/she may also experience social isolation and have a history of exposure to abuse or a belief in strict gender roles. Relationship factors: These include relationship styles that may contribute to poor communication, conflict-management and problem-solving skills, or the need for power and control. The perpetrator may also have experienced socialisation issues in childhood or a culture of dominance and control by one partner over the other, recent separation between partners, and unhealthy family relationships and interactions. Community factors: These include job loss, economic stress, poverty and its associated issues (e.g., overcrowded housing), and low social capital. Safe management measures imposed during the pandemic may exacerbate the tension between partners in a confined living arrangement. Societal factors: The perpetrator may have patriarchal values, with views that men hold power and dominate in rigid gender roles against women — including men having control over decision-making and limitations to women's independence in public and private life. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS SUGGESTIVE OF ABUSE? Clinicians may suspect possible abuse based on history taking, clinical signs or non-verbal cues. During history taking, if the history given is vague and inconsistent, where explanation for injuries is inadequate or does not match the physical findings, this may be cause for concern. Other hints include a clinical visit that does not address any obvious injuries or significant delays in seeking treatment from the time of injury, or where the patients continually minimise their symptoms. General observations of poor hygiene or malnutrition with decreasing body mass index may also raise red flags. The patient may attempt to hide the injuries with long sleeves, makeup, or cover the neck with hair. During physical examination, suggestive clinical signs include injuries located in unusual areas such as the back, buttocks or ears, patterned injuries such as from a belt or cigarette butts, injuries in multiple areas or multiple injuries of various ages. The patient may give irrelevant answers and excuses for injuries or check in with his/her partner before responding. In addition, non-verbal cues such as the patient being overly submissive or afraid, especially in the presence of the spouse or partner, or a lack of eye contact and avoidance of the spouse or partner are tell-tale signs. The reactions of the spouse or partner, if present, may also give clues. These include the spouse or partner showing incongruent reactions, downplaying or dismissing the symptoms, disallowing the patient to answer questions, or attempting to end the consult prematurely. HOW DO I ELICIT MORE INFORMATION? As patients may not offer abuse as their first presenting complaint, a high index of suspicion is needed. Victims may also minimise or deny their symptoms of abuse. To elicit more information, it is essential to establish a conducive environment for the patient to confide and trust in the doctor. This includes ensuring that the presence of a third party does not interfere with history taking and assessment, and asking the third party to step out if necessary. Direct and sensitive questions can aid in identification of abuse. For instance, physicians may start with a general statement, \"No matter how well people may get along, there are times when they disagree or get annoyed by the other person, or just have spats or fights because they are tired or in a bad mood.\" This can be followed by more detailed questions on whether the spouse or partner has done any of the following: (a) did or said something to spite the patient; (b) threatened to hit or throw something at the patient; (c) threw or smashed something at the patient; (d) pushed, grabbed, slapped, hit, kicked or shoved the patient; (e) threatened to hit other family members of the patient; (f) interacted with the patient in a way that makes him/her live in constant fear; (g) threatened the patient with a weapon; and (h) prevented the patient from contacting his/her extended family, relatives or friends. Screening tools that may be useful include the HITS (Hurt, Insult, Threaten and Scream) questionnaire (consists of only four questions), the Abuse Assessment Screen and the computer-based intimate partner violence questionnaire. Further information on screening tools can be obtained from the recommended readings. Inquiring about the presence of psychiatric illness in the spouse or intimate partner could be considered, as it is a potential risk factor and could have implications on the management of the patient. Special care should be taken when gathering information about suspected abuse. A balance should be struck with the amount of information gathered about the alleged abuse, bearing in mind that each time the patient talks about the alleged abuse, it can be potentially traumatic. Dissociation (e.g. glazed eyes, looking away) is a sign of distress when talking about abuse. The general practitioner can engage the patient in grounding techniques to re-establish a sense of safety and to re-orientate the patient to the present reality. Grounding techniques may include getting the patient to focus on who he/she is and the current location, and asking the patient to name three things that he/she can see, hear or feel in the room. Having a listening ear can be an empowering experience for the patient. The general practitioner should give the patient space to tell his/her story while offering validation and reassurance. It is also important to communicate to the patient that he/she is not at fault. The physician can do so by saying that \"Violence is unacceptable\", but should avoid asking questions such as \"Why did this person hit you?\", or saying anything that may suggest that the patient can control the violence. Patients may also need immediate help to formulate a safety plan, including advanced preparation in case of escalating violence and the need to safely leave the abuser (e.g., list of emergency contact numbers, alternative accommodations, linkup to family social service centres, and advice on making police report and applying for legal protections). WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Physicians are reminded that the duty of care is to the patients and not to the patients' intimate partners. The management of suspected abuse includes providing appropriate medical care, ensuring protection for the victim if there is a risk of imminent danger, notifying the appropriate authorities and informing the patient of avenues of assistance if needed. Firstly, appropriate medical care should be provided. This may include a referral to the emergency department if medically indicated. A lower threshold can also be applied for suspect cases to enable further investigations such as imaging. In such cases, physician should indicate non-accidental injury in the referral. Secondly, the suspected abuse has to be stopped and the physician can assist the patient to get the help needed to stop the violence. It is useful to understand how the existing legislation framework and protective and personal social services can support these patients. The Women's Charter, Penal Code, Children and Young Persons Act, Mental Capacity Act, Vulnerable Adult Act and Protection from Harassment Act have made provisions for definitions of abusive behaviour, chargeable offences, punishment and deterrence of the abusive behaviour, and provisions for protection of the victims. Protection of the victims come from the following: Personal Protection Order (PPO): This order is issued to the perpetrator and given to the victim to restrain the perpetrator from abusing the victim. If the perpetrator violates the order, he/she can be arrested by the police when the latter is called in. The perpetrator may be concurrently issued a Mandatory Counselling Order together with the PPO to require him/her to attend counselling. Domestic Exclusion Order (DEO): This order is issued to grant the victim exclusive occupation of the shared residence or a specific part of the shared residence to protect him/her from the perpetrator. Expedited Order (EO): If there is imminent danger of domestic violence against the victim at the time of application of PPO, the court can issue an EO to be served on the perpetrator. This is a temporary protection order granted in the absence of the perpetrator, pending the issuance of PPO. Counselling Order, Mandatory Assessment and Treatment Orders: These orders are usually issued to perpetrators to mandate them to receive counselling and treatment. General practitioners should be acquainted with the family service centres (FSCs) in the neighbourhood so that victims of intimate partner abuse can be referred to these centres expeditiously. The FSC social workers can then handhold these patients in the application for these orders either at the court or at the nearest specialist family violence centre, where video linkup with the court for virtual application is available. The FSC can also assist to arrange for crisis shelters for patients who need them. Children in the affected families may also be victims or witnesses of abuse. These experiences can be traumatic for them and hence, it is important to encourage patients to receive assistance from the FSC, if not for themselves (particularly if they show reluctance), then for the sake of their children. Thirdly, medical practitioners are legally required under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code to notify the police in the event of assessment of grievous hurt or high risk of imminent intimate partner violence that might lead to grievous hurt or death. To ensure the safety of the victim, it is recommended that the physician and social worker, in collaboration with the victim, should devise a safety plan to ensure ongoing support for the victim and other vulnerable persons in the family. Importantly, physicians will not be penalised for reporting cases that turn out not to be an abuse case, if there was reasonable suspicion for abuse. General practitioners practising within an institution can follow institutional guidelines for reporting. Otherwise, a police report can be made via the Police Report E-services portal at https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html. The following details should be clearly documented and included in the report: a description of the injuries sustained (written and/or pictorial description), the circumstances of the incident and the incident location. Finally, if the medical practitioner assesses a risk of potential abuse, but the patient turns down referrals for help, the patient may be discharged from medical follow-up. In such cases, the medical practitioner should still advise victims regarding the available avenues of assistance [Table 1], such as informing them that they can call the police at 999 or seek safe haven at any medical facility or FSC at any point in time, if they are at risk of immediate danger.Table 1: Avenues of assistance for victims of intimate partner abuse.WHAT IF I AM NOT SURE? If the medical practitioner is not certain whether the patient may be a victim of abuse, he/she should consult the National Anti-Violence 24/7 hotline at 1800 777 0000. RECOMMENDED READINGS 'Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening' from UpToDate, by Weil A.[3] Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Victimization Assessment Instruments for Use in Healthcare Settings: Version 1 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.[4] TAKE HOME MESSAGES Primary care providers are one of the first touchpoints of potential abuse cases and can help in early detection and escalation for intervention in these cases. A high index of suspicion is necessary as patients may not offer abuse as the presenting complaint. There are various types of abuse — physical, sexual, emotional-psychological, economical, wrongful confinement or social isolation. Clinical signs suggestive of abuse include injuries that cannot be adequately explained, injuries located in unusual locations, patterned injuries and multiple injuries of various ages. Clinicians can look for non-verbal cues and ask appropriate questions to identify abuse cases. Screening tools that may be useful to identify abuse cases include the HITS questionnaire, the abuse assessment screen and the computer-based intimate partner violence questionnaire. Clinicians have a duty of care to their patients, and not to the patients' intimate partners. Primary care providers should provide patients with adequate medical care or refer them to further medical care. They need to ensure that unclear cases who are discharged are counselled on the avenues for help. Clinicians should know the FSCs in the neighbourhood and refer their patients to the FSCs, if necessary. Medical professionals will not be penalised for reporting cases that turn out not to be an abuse case if there was reasonable suspicion for abuse. Failing to do so is an offence under the Criminal Procedure Code. Clinicians should keep a clear and detailed documentation of the injuries sustained, the circumstances of the injuries and the incident location to aid in subsequent investigations. Closing Vignette You requested for the patient's boyfriend to step out for you to perform a physical examination and managed to obtain a more detailed history. You assessed that Sarah may be a victim of abuse, documented your findings from the physical examination and assessment, and proceeded to treat her injuries. There was no serious bodily harm, and she had already moved back to her parent's home. As there was no immediate danger to the patient's life and she had a safe place to stay, you decided to refer her to the nearby FSC instead of the police. In addition, you provided her with information on the National Anti-Violence Helpline and advised her to make a report of the abuse at the nearest police station.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "‘Am I a Ceadas child?’: exploring the nature and experience of shame in the psychotherapy of an adolescent boy",
      "abstract": "Although shame is a central affect running through all phases of psychosexual and social development, it is usually masked by guilt and therefore it is not readily recognised, explored, and understood within the therapeutic situation. Moreover, there is a tendency to treat all shame manifestations as if they operate at the same level. The author proposes the need to distinguish between two qualitatively discrete manifestations of shame states which, albeit intertwined, operate at different levels and require different understanding and technique: a primary, unconscious kind based on psychobiological survival and triggered by a condition of psychic and physical danger, and a secondary, social shame, mainly conscious, based heavily on vision and evoked in social situations. The natural, primary form of shame becomes pathological after catastrophic chronic exposure of the primitive ego to unthinkable anxieties. Such premature rupture of primary skin containment may result in omnipotence-based pathological organisations impeding or precluding acceptance of guilt and need for reparation. Pathological primary shame predisposes the individual to states of pathological secondary shame. When initial traumatic conditions are re-activated and re-experienced in therapy, they may trigger re-enactments and, possibly, a negative therapeutic reaction. Recognising variations and mixed states of primary and secondary shame states, especially when shame is compounded with guilt, can provide guidance in the assessment of the fragility of the ego, and therefore inform our technique and the therapeutic process. This theoretical position is discussed with the help of clinical material from a twice-weekly psychotherapy of a 16-year-old boy imbued with shame compounded with guilt, related to transgenerational objectification and dehumanising experiences.",

      "abstract": "A esquizofrenia é um transtorno psiquiátrico complexo, caracterizado por distorções do pensamento, da percepção de si e da realidade externa. É uma psicose crônica idiopática de início precoce, associada a uma série de sintomas e sinais como alucinações, apatia, isolamento social e até suicídio, acometendo cerca de 1% da população mundial. Revisar a literatura sobre os subtipos de esquizofrenia. Realizou-se uma revisão integrativa da literatura com buscas nas bases de dados Lilacs e Medline. Foram cruzados com o operador booleano and os descritores ”esquizofrenia” e “tipos de esquizofrenia”. Os critérios de inclusão foram: artigos publicados em português, entre os anos de 2010 a 2020 e disponíveis na íntegra. Como critério de exclusão considerou-se a não pertinência ao tema. Foram identificadas 20 publicações que contemplavam os critérios e 4 foram utilizadas. A esquizofrenia é subdividida em tipos, na qual cada uma possui características peculiares. A Esquizofrenia Paranóide caracteriza-se pela presença de ideias delirantes, frequentemente de perseguição, em geral acompanhadas de alucinações e de perturbações das percepções. Seus portadores são indivíduos tensos, desconfiados, hostis e muito agressivos, podendo cometer atos de violência. A Esquizofrenia Hebefrênica configura-se pela presença proeminente de uma perturbação dos afetos. Além disso, o pensamento é desorganizado, o discurso incoerente e há uma tendência ao isolamento social. A Esquizofrenia Catatônica é caracterizada por distúrbios psicomotores proeminentes que podem alternar entre extremos tais como hipercinesia e estupor, ou entre a obediência automática e o negativismo. A Esquizofrenia Residual é caracterizada pela presença persistente de sintomas “negativos”,como alterações no comportamento, nas emoções e na interação social, embora não forçosamente irreversíveis e não com a mesma frequência dos outros tipos de esquizofrenia . Portanto, conhecer a esquizofrenia é de suma relevância na área da saúde para entendimento da doença em si bem como seus subtipos, o que permite o acompanhamento adequado do paciente e o tratamento que pode ser composto pela terapêutica medicamentosa e psicoterápica com o objetivo de otimizar a qualidade de vida do indivíduo acometido bem como a sociabilidade ao paciente e sua família.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

Genuine concerns about the validity of applying ‘adult’ psychotic diagnoses in this young age group, together with the lack of diagnosis-specific interventions, have suggested a cautious approach to diagnosis.

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "title": "AGMATINE AMELIORATES SOCIAL ISOLATION INDUCED OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR IN MICE",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses (obsession) and/or repetitive purposeful behaviors (compulsions). 13% of children and adults are suffering from this condition. There are evidences that increased OCD symptom severity has been linked with diminished quality of life [3] and also increased functional impairment. Social isolation is defined as a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts and they are deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships.Social isolation (SI) causes a variety of behavioral changes like hyper-locomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia, depression. In addition, Social isolation and OCD are associated with similar neurochemical changes like hypofunction of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate hyperfunction.These changes might be one of the causes for exacerbation of OCB in social isolation. Agmatine [4(amino butyl) guanidine] is an endogenous amine, widely present in mammalian brain and proposed as a novel neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.It is a metabolite of L-arginine via arginine decarboxylase and hydrolyzed to putrescine and urea by agmatinase. Recently, Agmatine is evidenced for anti-compulsive like effect . It has also been reported for its effectiveness in schizophrenia , addictive behavior , stress,anxiety [11] and depression . Besides this, Agmatine is evidenced for modulating levels of serotonin [13] as well as dopamine and glutamate levels .Incidentally, these neurotransmitters levels are altered in social isolation and OCD. [14] Hence, in the present study, the effect of agmatine was investigated in social isolation induced OCD in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Animals Adult male albino Swiss mice (22–25 g) were group housed (n=6) under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled conditions of temperature (23 ± 2C) and humidity (55 ± 10%). Mice were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days before carrying out the experiments. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) (SCOP/IAEC/2013/14/151). Drugs Agmatine sulfate was purchased from SigmaAldrich Ltd., USA. Drug solutions were prepared fresh and doses are expressed in terms of their free bases. Isolation condition Mice were housed singly in cages (21 x 38 x 14 cm) under a controlled 12-hour/12-hour light-dark cycle, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions), repetitive ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) and excessive anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is classified as an anxiety disorder under DSM-IV-TR guidelines. In OCD, the levels of serotonin and nitric oxide decreased; whereas levels of dopamine and glutamate increased in brain. Environmental conditions such as isolation from social surroundings lead to anxiety and increased level of aggression. The present study was designed to examine the effect of agmatine in social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior on marble burying behavior and locomotor activity. Agmatine (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in different groups of mice; activity was observed 30 min after dosing. Acute treatment of agmatine (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced marble burying behavior. Moreover, hyperlocomotion was observed in socially isolated animals and agmatine was found to attenuate the same without affecting basal locomotions. In conclusion, agmatine effectively decreases social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior in mice.",

      "title": "Locus of Control, Social Support and Alcoholism",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlcohol dependence is a chronic, recurrent illness of progressive course which, if not treated, has a predictably negative outcome. It is characterized by numerous cognitive, behavioural and physiological symptoms as well as a person's tendency to consume alcohol even when significant alcohol consumption related problems have occurred.1 There are many factors influencing the development of alcohol related disorders and the disorder itself leads to problems in different areas of an individual's functioning. Alcoholics have a specific lifestyle and specific habits, they experience problems in their professional lives, communication and relationships with their families and friends, they lose motivation and willingness to pursue the existing interests, self confidence and self esteem are worsening, it is becoming more and more difficult to meet the demands of their environment to the degree that they are completely unable to meet those requirements and therefore they reject them.This is why it is necessary to examine different demographic characteristics of individual, concrete problems, co morbid psychiatric disorders, existence of addictions in a family, cognitive functioning. It seems that, for the treatment, it is particularly important to recognize the availability of social support and the degree of insight into the problem, motivation to change the behaviour, perception of personal competence, locus of control.Locus of control refers to the perceived place, in other words, location of doers who/which the person perceives as a source of control of their own behaviour and the cause of everything that happens to them.8 Internally oriented individuals attribute the results of their behaviour to their own actions, abilities, efforts or any other characteristics. At the other end of the continuum there are individuals with external locus of control and therefore they attribute control over the outcomes of their behaviour to powers outside themselves, such as luck, chance or more powerful others. An individual who believes that he is responsible for his alcohol related problems and that successful abstinence depends only on their decision to stop drinking, has an internal locus of control over consumption of alcohol, while an individual with external alcohol consumption locus of control attributes his problems with alcohol and treatment outcomes to external powers.3 The research by Mariano and oth.3 showed that alcohol related internal locus of control is in a positive relation with motivation to change, involvement in treatment and abstinence duration.However, the things a person experiences and the basis for their choice of behaviour is not only under the influence of their inner man but also of their environment. Numerous studies have proved social support to be an important guideline in main- taining of alcohol and drug abstinence.2-6 In addition, decreasing stress perception in a specific situation and effective use of strategies to face the stress is a mechanism by which social support influences the maintenance of abstinence.2Objective of this research was to: examine correlation between person's characteristics (alcohol consumption locus of control) and social support (support from family and support from friends), and abstinence duration and examine contribution of personality and social support in explaining abstinence duration.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODSParticipantsThe research included 60 men aged 26-74 (X=47,64; SD=9,76), diagnosed with chronic alcoholism and treated in Psychiatric clinic, Clinical Hospital Center in Osijek, and members of Alcoholic Anonymous in Osijek, Valpovo and Dakovo. Graphs 1 and 2 show structure of participants based on kind of consumed alcohol consumed consumed and co morbidity. Most of the participants have secondary school degree and are retired. Participants most commonly consume beer, most of them have no co morbidity and among those who have, the most common are posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. …",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Across the Life Span",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by affective dysregulation, intense, unstable interpersonal relationships, impulsivity and unstable identity. It overlaps considerably with both PTSD and bipolar spectrum disorders. Research on true late-life BPD is limited, but suggests that some of the core features of BPD including interpersonal difficulties, unstable affect and anger remain relatively unchanged, while impulsivity and identity disturbance decline or change their mode of expression in late life. Diagnosis of BPD in late life requires flexible application of the standard diagnostic criteria as well as a thorough longitudinal history. The etiology of BPD is best explained as a combination of genetic, neurobiological vulnerability combined with childhood trauma, abuse or neglect that leads to dysregulated emotions, distorted cognitions, social skills deficits, and few adaptive coping strategies. Treatment options include pharmacotherapy (especially mood stabilizers, SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics) and psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on distress tolerance, affective regulation, changing distorted beliefs, and introducing new social and relationship problem-solving skills (especially Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Schema Focused Cognitive Therapy). In late-life care environments, 174such as nursing homes and other residential facilities, staff need to be empowered to set appropriate limits on problematic behavior while maintaining empathy and validating the painful affect patients often experience. doi:10.1300/J074v19n01_11 [Article copies available for a fee from The Haworth Document Delivery Service: 1-800-HAWORTH.

Although appearance is within normal limits, the patient feels that this is noticeable to others. Views on the nature of this condition are illustrated by two case histories. It is proposed that dysmorphophobia is a discrete psychiatric illness. The symptoms arise in individuals with schizoid, narcissistic, or obsessional personality traits and should be distinguished from those phenomena which are secondary to morbid psychological processes.",

      "abstract": "Two situations, which may of course interfere, are described in the field of psychological and psychiatric emergencies in child and adolescent: 1) therapeutic emergencies, true emergencies, linked to acute mental suffering or even distress in the child which it is important to relieve quickly. They are not always the object of an acute request for medical care, and when such a request is made, it is rarely based on what the child feels, but much more on noisy or troublesome behaviour or somatic manifestations of the latter, this last possibility producing a masked psychiatric emergency very characteristic of this age; 2) environmental emergencies represent a second form of emergency, defined by a situation which appears when the child's family or tutors suddenly decide that they can no longer face such a behaviour or such symptoms in the child. Intolerance then appears, or even rejection of the child from his home. The authors were led to determine this double dimension, concentrating their attention on the first few years of life, childhood from 4 to 5 years to 11 or 12 years and adolescence. Insisting on the dual necessity, even in emergency cases, of sufficient reflexion and necessary concentration of interest on problems as they are presented by the family, the authors describe the various stages of an emergency: entering into contact, evaluation of the situation, choice of the emergency procedure: gaining time or admission to hospital in a specialized unit. They end by taking into consideration the fact that one is never sufficiently attentive to the child himself and to his own way of dealing with the situation.",

      "title": "Compulsive Sexual Behaviors in a Young Male with Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behaviours are relatively rare and are not known to be associated with social phobias, with an intense scientific debate on going if it constitutes a behavioral addiction. Compulsive sexual behaviours otherwise known as Hypersexuality/problematic sexual behaviour and is identified by a persistent pattern of failure to control repetitive, intense urges, fantasies and behaviours of a sexual nature over an extended period of time that causes marked impairment in multiple areas of functioning, in this case, especially educational functioning. Phobic anxiety disorders also known as social phobias are a group of conditions in which anxiety is triggered typically in well-defined situations that are not currently dangerous with resulting avoidance of such situations. Nevertheless, CSB is not captured in DSM V and ICD10, although, diagnostic criteria were proposed during DSM V revision, it is not currently recognized in the DSMV. Although, CSB has been proposed for inclusion in ICD 11 as an impulse control disorder, rather than as a mental and behavioural disorder as previously debated, in addition, strict diagnostic guidelines were instituted due to concerns of over pathologizing sexual behaviours. This presents a diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the psychiatrist when a patient presents with symptoms of Compulsive sexual behaviours with or without anxiety, since there are presently no diagnostic and treatment guidelines. We present the case of a 23 year old 3rd year medical student with a 5 year history of compulsive masturbation, persistent pornography viewing, failure to resist impulses and fantasies with accompanying intense distress especially following periods of abstinence and a two year history of recurrent panic attacks in social settings in which women were triggers complicated by depressive symptoms, symptoms significantly impaired most areas of functioning particularly his academics.\r\n\r\n A diagnosis of Social Phobia/Social Anxiety disorder with episodic panic attacks and compulsive sexual behaviours and mild depressive episode was made because patient met criteria according to ICD 10 and proposed ICD 11. Mental state examination shows anxious mood, congruent with affect, depersonalization, derealization as well as anxious ruminations. Within a year, after commencement of an SSRI, Atenolol and Lisonopril and CBT all anxiety symptoms resolved with marked reduction in the frequency of pornography viewing as well as compulsive masturbation with associated fantasies. This case report lends voice to the on-going debate about the inclusion of compulsive sexual behaviours as a mental and behavioural disorder Dependence syndrome in diagnostic classification systems as well as the need for development of standardized appropriate treatment modalities. This case report will highlight Compulsive Sexual Behaviours, rationale for its inclusion as an addiction in classification systems and treatment approaches to the disorder.",

There are many ways of classifying symptoms in schizophrenia and there has been a clinical impression that violence is related to positive symptoms and disorganization. However, the predictive value of symptoms is small compared to such characteristics as early onset of antisocial behaviour, antisocial and psychopathic traits, earlier violence and abuse problems. Alcohol and substance abuse is associated with an increased risk of violent behaviour in people with and without mental disorders. Recent research suggests that this increased risk is larger still in people with schizophrenia than in people with no mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Axis II disorders include a variety of personality disorders and mental retardation. A personality disorder is “an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time and leads to distress of impairment” (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). Dangerous behaviors (i.e., violence or suicide attempts) are mostly found among individuals with personality disorders included in Cluster B Category: Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, and Narcissistic Personality Disorders. Individuals with Cluster B Personality Disorders often appear dramatic, emotional, and/or erratic. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder, which is in Cluster A, talk about violence but are usually not violent (Tardiff, 1998). The other personality disorders in Cluster A, Schizoid and Schizotypal Personality Disorders, and those in Cluster C (Avoidant, Dependent, and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorders) are not dangerous although occasionally violent or suicidal behaviors may occur if they feel angry or depressed or have an accompanying Axis I disorder, which is linked to violent or suicidal behavior. Some individuals with mental retardation are violent as a consequence of frustration and an inability to express themselves verbally.This chapter will focus on personality disorders in Cluster B and Paranoid Personality Disorder, since these are the most frequent and challenging cases where the clinician must decide whether the patient is a short-term risk for violence or suicidal behavior.",

There is mental retardation secondary to language deficits, but no social withdrawal, overwhelming anxiety, or obsessive need for sameness.

      "title": "Developing an International Core Outcome Set for SSD Interventions",
      "abstract": "Unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) is defined as normal or near-normal hearing in one ear and a severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing impairment in the other ear.1 Common causes of SSD in adulthood include vestibular schwannoma and associated surgery, Ménière's disease, and bacterial or viral infections. SSD affects an estimated 12 to 27 individuals in every 100,000 of the general population.2Shutterstock/Inspiring, hearing loss, deafness, technology.Figure 1: Steps to develop a core outcome set for SSD interventions for adults. Hearing loss, deafness, technology.Difficulties in daily life as a result of SSD vary considerably from person to person. Functional difficulties in everyday life are commonly reported, such as difficulties in speech perception in noisy environments and poor spatial awareness. SSD can also negatively affect one's psychological well-being, resulting in worries about losing one's hearing in the other ear and/or reduced confidence and belief in one's abilities to participate in social situations. Various social impacts of SSD can result from activity limitations and participation restrictions, including withdrawal from and within situations.3 The multidimensional burden of SSD on an individual's overall health is indicated by reductions in health-related quality of life.4 Interventions like a contralateral routing of signals (CROS) aid or a bone conduction device aim to alleviate the impact of SSD by rerouting signals from the impaired ear to the better-hearing ear.5 In the past decade, we have seen the introduction of cochlear implantation,6 which restores hearing by delivering information directly to the impaired side, thus creating a sensation of true binaural hearing. TREATMENT CHALLENGES The challenge faced by people diagnosed with SSD, health care professionals, and clinical researchers is understanding which intervention (if any) is ideal.7 How can we measure the benefits or harms associated with an intervention for SSD? Existing literature has highlighted inconsistencies in the benefits and risks (side effects), or outcome domains, assessed when evaluating these interventions. For example, clinical studies that evaluate these interventions have measured performances such as speech perception in quiet or noisy environments and sound localization. Studies have also assessed tinnitus symptom severity and quality of life. The tests (measurement instruments) that researchers have chosen to measure these effects also vary widely from study to study. For example, sound localization can be measured using a setup of four loudspeakers arranged at the front, back, and sides (90 degrees apart) or a more complex setup of six loudspeakers arranged in a semi-circle in front of the participant (30 degrees apart). This diversity of chosen measures poses a challenge to both health care users and professionals when comparing and contrasting various study outcomes. In some cases, researchers choose available measures because they are standardized or easily accessible, and not because of their importance to health care users or professionals themselves. ADDRESSING THE INCONSISTENCY Identifying appropriate outcome domains is crucial to designing clinical trials to evaluate the effects of various interventions for SSD.8 Selected outcomes need to be vital and tailored to key stakeholders such as health care users, professionals, or budget holders to minimize bias when making decisions about health care.9 Furthermore, the choice of outcome measures should be based on what is important and of interest to people making decisions about health care, not on what outcome instruments are available or most commonly used. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative just celebrated its 10th anniversary. The network brings together researchers interested in the development of agreed and standardized sets of outcomes, known as core outcome sets. Part of the COMET work focuses on developing recommendations on minimum standards for the design of core outcome set (COS) studies.10 A COS is a recommendation of what should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific area as a minimum. If developed from the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders, a COS can overcome the problems imposed by the utilization of diverse measures. In the field of audiology and ENT, a group led by Professor Deborah A. Hall at the University of Nottingham has developed a COS for tinnitus.11 Professor Iain A. Bruce and his team at the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre are working on the PONCHO study: Prioritizing Outcomes iN Childhood Hearing lOss. THE CROSSSD STUDY The Core Rehabilitation Outcome Set for Single-Sided Deafness (CROSSSD) project is an international initiative that aims to develop a COS for SSD interventions. It aims to find an agreement on what outcomes are critical and should always be measured when evaluating interventions for SSD, using the methodology proposed by the COMET initiative. We have an advisory group of clinical professionals from the United Kingdom, United States, and Europe. The CROSSSD project also works closely with people who have lived experience of SSD. They have been integral to the design and delivery of the CROSSSD study. For example, a promotional video (http://bit.ly/2QbLJk) was developed alongside collaborators with lived experience of SSD to increase awareness of the project and help with global participant recruitment. Our methodology is as follows (Fig. 1): Systematic review of the published literature reporting interventions for SSD to identify the outcome domains and measurement instruments that have already been used.12 Workshops using a range of qualitative methods to explore patient perspectives on outcomes. Interactive online consensus exercise, known as a Delphi survey, with key stakeholders to identify which outcome domains are important when evaluating SSD interventions. Interactive consensus meeting with a subgroup of the key stakeholders to discuss the Delphi survey findings and recommend a minimum set of outcome domains that are relevant to all. So far, we have completed the systematic review of the literature. From 72 papers, we identified a total of 244 outcome domains. Many of these were duplicates or not directly relevant to SSD, and so we were able to produce a shortened list of 44 unique candidate outcome domains. The Delphi survey engaged 277 participants from 30 countries. They suggested five additional candidate outcome domains. The e-Delphi concluded in February 2020 and the CROSSSD team are currently preparing for the interactive consensus meeting to finalize the core outcome domain set. FUTURE STEPS Once a COS is developed, we would know what is important to measure in all studies; however researchers also need to consider how the included outcomes should be measured. The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) international initiative has collaborated with the COMET initiative to develop guidelines for selecting outcome measurement instruments for outcomes included in a COS.13 For instance, if quality of life is an outcome in a COS, indicated to be critical and important to always measure for SSD interventions, COSMIN standards can help us establish what commonly agreed instrument or questionnaire everyone should utilize to measure it. Appropriate dis emination strategies14 will ensure that anyone designing a trial in this area will have a list of outcomes to measure as a minimum, alongside a list of recommended instruments to utilize. The COS will not prevent researchers from measuring additional outcomes or utilizing supplementary instruments. Future studies in the field should adopt the recommended COS to reduce the heterogeneity of measures utilized. Moreover, only outcomes meaningful to all stakeholders will be employed and, as a result, transparency will be established since both benefits and harms will be reported. Clinical researchers will be supported in thinking critically about what they are trying to measure, and they will not select their outcomes simply based on the popularity or accessibility of available instruments. Uptake of the COS will be encouraged internationally to improve research quality, enhance clinical decision-making, and facilitate meta-analysis in systematic reviews.

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

It is not enough investigated, what kind of disorders they are like, their characteristics are, and how they differ from schizoid personality disorder and continuous sluggish schizophrenia. with the aim to define the clinical features of schizotypal personality disorder 58 patients were examined. Results: • Schizotypal personality disorder is similar to deficit states, observed at schizophrenia, clinically limited to personality sphere, without the signs of flow of endogenous process and psychotic disorders. • Schizotypal personality disorder on the clinical content reminds schizoid, but insignificant ideatory disorders are typical. Dymamic of psychopathy - disposition to decompensation - is never observed. • Schizotypal personality disorder can be diagnosed as latent schizophrenia, because the clinical picture is similar. the special value acquires a dynamic aspect typical of the endogenous process. • High quality remission of schizophrenia limited of specific personality changes, as a variant of «acquired psychopathy» can be considered as clinically identical to «schizotypal personality disorder». Conclusion: A content of Schizotypal personality disorder includes a group of disorders of schizophrenia spectrum, different originally, from shizofreniform personality disorders without the signs of dynamics to the different states of development of schizophrenia - initial (latent schizophrenia), and final (high quality remission of schizophrenia as practical completion of schizophrenia process with the formation of certain features of personality). It can explain the special place of «Schizotypal personality disorder» in the classification of psychic disorders.",

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

      "abstract": "Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an uncommon autoimmune neurological disorder marked by painful muscle stiffness, muscle spasms, and limb weakness. Neurological symptoms in SPS can mimic a psychogenic movement disorder in which symptoms are triggered by sudden movement and emotional distress, which might delay proper treatment. However, psychiatric symptoms are far less common, and there is limited understanding regarding the co-occurrence of psychiatric conditions. Psychiatric symptoms include nonspecific anxiety, agoraphobia, and depression, which can be triggered by sudden movement, noise, or emotional stress. This case report dives into the psychiatric manifestations seen in a patient with SPS. The case report focuses on a 42-year-old female with SPS, migraines, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, and a psychiatric history of anorexia, depression, and anxiety. Her unique presentation underscored the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to psychiatric care. The patient was evaluated and managed during her admission to the psychiatric unit for unspecified psychosis. Her course included a complicated medical evaluation for cardiovascular and neurologic symptoms and comprehensive psychiatric management. She manifested resistance to specific psychiatric medications and care strategies. She had atypical presentations, like sensory symptoms and left-sided chest pain. She exhibited paranoia and psychosis, which were managed with a combination of pharmacologic treatments, including aripiprazole. Psychotic symptoms were resolved upon discharge, with an emphasis on strict outpatient follow-up. This case report enhances our understanding of the clinical nuances associated with SPS and its intersection with psychiatric symptoms. The objective of this case report is to detail the diagnostic and therapeutic complexities of managing psychosis in a patient with SPS, along with a pre-existing complex medical and psychiatric profile, and to contribute to a deeper understanding of SPS and associated psychiatric conditions and more effective management strategies.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

Approximately 30% of individuals with the 7q11.23 duplication have one or more congenital anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is established by detection of a recurrent 1.5- to 1.8-Mb heterozygous duplication of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR). Management Treatment of manifestations: Aortic dilation is treated with beta blocker therapy and/or surgery as needed. Constipation should be aggressively managed at all ages to prevent encopresis and impaction. Address developmental disabilities, including ASD, through early intervention programs (including speech/language therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy), special education programs, and vocational training. Address ASD with applied behavior analytic interventions and other empirically supported psychosocial approaches. Address childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or manifestations of this disorder with intensive speech/language therapy to maximize effective oral communication and prevent or limit later language impairment and/or reading disorder. Address emotional and behavioral disorders (aggression, social anxiety, selective mutism) with cognitive-behavioral therapy, applied behavior analysis behavior modification intervention, and psychotropic medications as needed. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of head circumference in infancy. Annual monitoring of aortic diameter (including Z scores in children) and behavior. Annual assessment by occupational and physical therapists and speech and language pathologists until age six years. Genetic counseling The 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. About 27% of probands have an affected parent. When a parent has the 7q11.23 duplication, the risk to each sib of inheriting the duplication is 50%. If the 7q11.23 duplication identified in the proband is not identified in the parents, the risk to sibs is low (",

The meaning varies from one individual to another and depends on his cognitive-emotional organisation. In order to study such an organisation, it can be useful to classify his mental state regarding his attachment.

      "title": "[\"Shuuchaku\" in various types of manic-depressive patients].",
      "abstract": "Shimoda's concept of \"statothymia\" consists of the hypothesis on the characteristic of the emotionality of manic-depressive patients (Shuuchaku-temperament) and the typological description of their personality (Shuuchaku-personality). According to him their emotion, when it has once arisen in relation to something, hardly diminishes. This characteristic constitutes a neurophysiological basis of the disease. The persons, who have this characteristic of emotionality, are quite reliable persons in society, who make every effort to accomplish their obligation, to take responsibility. But at the same time under the overloading situation they are not able to get out of the persistent involvement in work and consequently fall into depressive or manic phases. Although this concept is even today relevant to the core group of mood disorder, it has also some limitations. There are lots of cases in which overwork does not precipitate the manifestation of the disease. The loss of an important person and the change in surroundings are classically well known precipitating situations of melancholic phases. Nowadays such cases are also found, in which failure to acquire a desirable social environment or a romantic partner precipitates the outbreak of the disease. Furthermore such patients of younger generation categorized into \"soft bipolar spectrum\" defined by Akiskal are far from socially reliable persons, rather maladjusted. Shuuchaku-personality or Typus melancholicus, which is almost equivalent of it, constitutes only one of the various types of patients, together with such types as manic type, avoidant-dependent type and \"soft bipolar\" type. This article aims at, not only by following Shimoda's concept but also by taking the ordinary meaning of the Japanese word \"Shuuchaku\" into consideration, presenting a new formulation applicable to various types of the patients of mood disorder. The Japanese word \"Shuuchaku\" orginally means \"sticking to\" or \"preoccupied with\" a certain object, surrounding, or ideal. We consider that in manic-depressive patients the self, which has once been strongly connected with such objects or ideals hardly retreats into past and sticks to the present self. This formulation is not only in accordance with Shimoda's hypothesis on the characteristic of emotionality but also it reveals how the problem of object relation and that of temporality are interconnected with each other in manic depressive patients. One of the prominent features of the melancholic symptoms is that patients have the feeling of irrevocability. This indicates in return that in their premelancholic phase they live rather in revocable time. This revocable time is, from our view, the time in which the past self does not completely retreat and always sticks to the present self. In the patients of Typus melancholicus, since the self, which has well been settled in a stable surrounding, always sticks to the present self, the present self continues to avoid an irrevocable change. At the same time since the self, which has not completely taken responsibility, sticks to the present self and drives it to achieve more preciseness in taking responsibility, the order of their surrounding is maintained before it is irrevocably disintegrated. However overloading and unexpected changes in their surrounding could undermine their revocable time and lead them to the outbreak of the disease. In contrast the patients of manic type are not able to settle down in a stable surrounding, rather they often develop conflict with it. In them the self, which could have acquired a desirable condition but has not, sticks to the present self and drives it to seek more ideal conditions outside of the surrounding already given to them. In them the failure to acquire a new desirable condition could precipitate the disease. Furthermore their life course could be close to that of \"soft bipolar\" patients, when it becomes unstable through the conflict and the disillusion with their surrounding and the consequent withdrawal from real social life.",

      "title": "Burnout Syndrome in Professional Workers Who Deal with Treated Alcoholics",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONProfessional stress1 represents an imbalance of workplace requirements and surroundings with our abilities, wishes and expectations concerning fulfilling these requirements. The long-term exposure to professional stress results in the burnout syndrome, the most unfavorable outcome, which affects particularly the helping professions (psychiatrists, social workers, nurses...).2 One of the definitions states that the burnout syndrome is a gradual process in which once a productive and responsible worker loses all interest in his/her work or profession.3 It is a cumulative process that comes with small warning signs. Years can go by till symptoms are manifested as psychological or emotional problems as these signs are often diminutive. The burnout syndrome consists of four stages. The first stage, beginners enthusiasm is characterized by unreal expectations and self-investing of helper followed by high level of energy and good achievements. Second one is a stagnation stage in which helper starts to understand that work isn't as imagined, which is followed by the first appearance of physical and psychological exhaustion, pessimism and a lack of satisfaction with work. Isolation stage is the third stage, characterized by emotional withdrawal, avoiding contacts with colleagues, depression, negativism, angriness and hostility. Syndrome progression continues, sped by physical difficulties (chronic exhaustion, insomnia, headache, allergies etc.). Apathy and a lack of life interests, as a final stage, are the results of chronic frustration and complete lack of interest. Characteristics symptoms are loss of self-confidence, cynicism, serious emotional difficulties, not being able to communicate and work with colleagues and diminished interpersonal relations.4The burnout syndrome can be stopped before the helper arrives at the last stage. The whole process can be turned the other way around by changing the working goals, attitudes and behaviors in the work surroundings,5 as the cause of professional stress can be internal and external.The mental help of professional workers is at risk because of their everyday need to communicate with treated alcoholics, listen to the life problems, traumatic events, losses and similar issues.6 They are mostly unaware of how this line of work affects them and they avoid asking for help. Not recognizing the burnout syndrome, professional workers are themselves at risk of developing a negative attitude towards the treated alcoholics and provide ineffective and inadequate help.Aim of this study was to investigate if professional workers recognized the burnout syndrome in working with treated alcoholics; if professional workers who work with treated alcoholics suffered from burnout syndrome; which profession is the most affected by the burnout syndrome and if there were any differences in social-demographic features and to see used strategies of self-help.METHODS AND SAMPLEThe questionnaire consisted of 36 questions divided into two parts. The first part referred to professional workers' perception of the burnout syndrome and its causes, and the second part was The Burnout Syndrome Questionnaire1 (appendix).The study included 40 professional workers (doctors, social workers, nurses, psychologist, special teachers),8,9 mainly from the city of Zagreb (Table 1). 40% of them work with treated alcoholics in Departments of Psychiatry in three Zagreb University Hospitals, 37.5% work only in clubs for treated alcoholics and 22.5% work in both. The structure of professional workers in relation to the working place was expected. In hospitals, representation of nurses and doctors was highest, but in clubs for treated alcoholics there were more social workers (Table 2). The mean age of professional workers was 45 years (min. - 24, max - 68), while the mean duration of working with treated alcoholics was 15 years (min. - 1, max. - 40), which means 22 hours per week (min. …",

      "title": "Comparison of Language Disorders in Psychotic Disorder (Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Drug-Induced Psychosis)",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe term refers to many diverse behavioral forms which are not in connection with reality. In other words, the person exhibiting psychotic behavior has weird and extraordinary thoughts and perceptions about whatever happens. Such behavior might include delusions and/or hallucinations (Haljyn and Cross Vytbvrn, 2003). In the 5th statistical and diagnostic manual of psychological disorders, the five principal categories were omitted. The respective categories were labeled as a single class entitled Schizophrenic and Other Psychotic Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2004). Schizophrenia is the most substantial disorder faced by the psychiatry. Schizophrenia mainly turns the most fertile and constructive living years of the patients into inability due to its prevalence age (i.e., early adulthood) and extensive complications (Parva, Mazinani, A'shayeri, and Javadi-Khomami, 2004). The following figures have been reported for prevalence of mental disorders in USA: schizophrenia 1%, schizophrenia form 0.2%, schizoaffective 0.5%, and delusion and joint psychiatric disorder and other psychotic disorders approximately 0.025 per each disease case (Caplan, 1994). Individuals suffering from schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders often exhibit abnormal language damages (Raisi, and Mahmoudi Salmani, 2004) such that speech disturbances are considered among the major symptoms in diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (Vita et al., 1995).Melinder and Barch (2003) described at least two types of language damages (of course, not necessarily separate) in patients suffering from schizophrenia. The first type is thought disorder or failure in maintaining a speech plan which is in turn divided into two branches: formal thought disorder and negative thought disorder. The second type of these damages is schizophrenia which includes variety of traumas such as neologism, incomprehensible speeches or clang association. In formal thought disorder, the speech of the schizophrenic individual has anomalies in semantic rules as well as forming style of language, and, the sentences are obscurely linked. Symptoms like improper repetitions, tangentially, missing the goal, mistake in reference of the pronoun, and neologism are observed in this group. Negative thought disorder is characterized by reduction in syntactic complexities and speech volume. The speech of the patient becomes concise and short such that the vocabulary treasure seems small. This branch of thought disorder differs from disruptions in oral expression, syntactic complexity, and natural hesitations and pauses (Raisi, and Mahmoudi Salmani, 2004). Many unanswered questions have been posed concerning speech and language disorders of psychotic patients. Language is regarded as the most intricate mind product that influences nearly all high-level mind activities i.e., perception, determination, conception, cognition, thought, reasoning, judgment, imagination, problem solving, and even emotions and personality growth. From another aspect, language is the only means to assess major disorder i.e., thought disorder in the respective patients (Parva, Mazinani, A'shayeri, and Javadi-Khomami, 2004). Furthermore, other attitudes consider the major disorder in schizophrenic patients as a language disorder. For instance, CHAIKA in 1974 (quoted by GOURREN 1996) holds the opinion that psychotic patients suffer from an alternating aphasia on which they have no control (Zarrella, 1995). ZAS (1993) believes it is wrong to infer that the respective patients have thought disorder solely based on their language as schizophrenic and psychotic patients- unlike the aphasia patients - have no problem in their expression and in fact the listener has difficulty in understanding their words (Willig, 1998). Language disorders have been popularly recognized from long times ago but such disorders have particularly attracted attraction of psychologists and linguists during the recent decades (Talebi Nejad, 1993). …",

In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

Although long thought to be the secondary effect of medication, institutionalization, or symptoms, cognitive dysfunction is now thought to be an independent core deficit. This review covers evidence for the cognitive domains that appear to be most impaired from studies of: (i) first episode patients; (ii) cognitive stability; (iii) the universality of deficits; and (iv) deficits in non-psychotic relatives. All of these serve to strengthen the notion that schizophrenia patients and their relatives are most impaired in attentional, executive, verbal declarative memory, and verbal fluency functions. These cognitive domains are subserved by neural networks linking frontal, anterior cingulate, and temporal-limbic regions, and may represent cognitive endophenotypes in the search for genetic markers. The search for causes of schizophrenia might be enhanced by the further elucidation of neuropsychological deficits in patients and relatives.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a multifaceted disorder characterized by multiple motor and at least one vocal tics that start in childhood, persist for at least 1 year, and cannot be attributed to another medical condition or exposure to medications/drugs. Clinical diagnostic criteria are available, and identification of tics is typically straightforward based on characteristic appearance and features. Diagnostic uncertainty can rarely arise in cases of mild tics, atypical features, certain psychiatric comorbidities, and other non-tic movement disorders. Comorbid psychopathology, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive behaviors/obsessive-compulsive disorder, affects the majority of patients and is correlated with disease severity and the presence of additional psychiatric behaviors. The severity of tics often improves after adolescence, whereas psychiatric symptoms typically persist. The subset of patients in whom tics persist into adulthood experience higher rates of anxiety, and lower self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and quality of life; the relative contribution of motor tics and psychopathology is not fully understood. This article summarizes the clinical features of Tourette syndrome, including major diagnostic criteria, unique features of tics, and key aspects that differentiate tics from common mimics and chameleons. Comorbid psychiatric conditions and their impact on phenotype and quality of life are described. Finally, current understanding of the natural history is summarized, including limited research in adults with Tourette syndrome.",

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

The level of anxiety experienced by the person with social anxiety disorder is excessive, and results in substantial impairment in the sufferer's social, family, and professional life. Three distinct subtypes of the disorder have been identified: generalized social anxiety disorder, in which the individual fears a multitude of social situations; nongeneralized social anxiety disorder, in which only 2 or 3 situations are feared; and public-speaking phobia. Results from a number of studies suggest that these subtypes of social anxiety disorder may represent distinct clinical syndromes, with the generalized subtype producing the most severe disability. Despite the prevalence of social anxiety disorder and the disability it causes, this condition remains underdiagnosed, and thus undertreated, by clinicians. This review discusses the barriers that prevent people who have this disorder from seeking help, and the steps that clinicians can take to aid their recognition and treatment of the disorder. It is only by effective diagnosis and treatment that the burden of social anxiety disorder will be lifted, allowing patients to resume a normal life.",

      "title": "Down syndrome: Cognitive and behavioral functioning across the lifespan",
      "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) commonly possess unique neurocognitive and neurobehavioral profiles that emerge within specific developmental periods. These profiles are distinct relative to others with similar intellectual disability (ID) and reflect underlying neuroanatomic findings, providing support for a distinctive phenotypic profile. This review updates what is known about the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes associated with DS across the lifespan. In early childhood, mild deviations from neurotypically developing trajectories emerge. By school‐age, delays become pronounced. Nonverbal skills remain on trajectory for mental age, whereas verbal deficits emerge and persist. Nonverbal learning and memory are strengths relative to verbal skills. Expressive language is delayed relative to comprehension. Aspects of language skills continue to develop throughout adolescence, although language skills remain compromised in adulthood. Deficits in attention/executive functions are present in childhood and become more pronounced with age. Characteristic features associated with DS (cheerful, social nature) are personality assets. Children are at a lower risk for psychopathology compared to other children with ID; families report lower levels of stress and a more positive outlook. In youth, externalizing behaviors may be problematic, whereas a shift toward internalizing behaviors emerges with maturity. Changes in emotional/behavioral functioning in adulthood are typically associated with neurodegeneration and individuals with DS are higher risk for dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Individuals with DS possess many unique strengths and weaknesses that should be appreciated as they develop across the lifespan. Awareness of this profile by professionals and caregivers can promote early detection and support cognitive and behavioral development. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "title": "Identifying the constructs to non-melancholic depression: stress",
      "abstract": "As noted in Chapter 1, the binary model of depression viewed one ‘type’ of depression (i. e. reactive or neurotic depression) as essentially being a response to a major or salient life-event stressor. By contrast, the other type of depression (endogenous or melancholic) was seen as a condition that occurred without any such trigger, with the term ‘endogenous’ emphasising that the depression came from ‘within’ rather than from stressors and the environment. We now turn to examine the role of life-event stressors in those with non-melancholic disorders. Life-event stressors may, theoretically, be all-explanatory and contribute totally to the onset of the depressive disorder. Terms such as ‘reactive depression’ and ‘adjustment disorder with depressed mood’ emphasise the contribution of a life event and do not recognise any predisposing or other factor. While life events may vary in their magnitude, one could posit that most of these ‘pure state’ reactions are likely to be in response to cataclysmic or extremely severe depressing events, and where it might be imagined that most people would develop such a depressive condition.",

      "abstract": "Causes of aggressive behaviour in children and adolescents are manifold with exogenous and endogenous factors such as personality traits, temperament, family, socio-cultural, economic and financial factors closely intertwined. Aggressive behaviour, however, can also be associated with mental disorders and this is the topic discussed by the present article. Isolated and occasional outbursts of anger, aggressiveness and rage in children and adolescents can often be confused with conduct disorder. However, conduct disorder is characterised by a stable aggressive behavioural pattern, recurrently violating either the basic rights of the others or of the generally accepted social norms. Aggressive behaviour can also be present in Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD), affective and psychotic disorders, autistic spectrum disorders and in some other developmental neurological disorders including intellectual disability ‒ but only as a possible and not a typical symptom. Child and adolescent psychiatrist can mainly help with aggressive behaviour associated with mental disorders. In all other possible causes of aggressive behaviour, child and adolescent psychiatry has neither the possibility/capacity nor the authority to intervene.",

      "abstract": "The root causes of obsessions in children with both schizoform disorders and neurotic spectrum disorders vary quite widely, and was not always possible to identify. However, it is worth noting that in children with neurotic disorders, obsessions more often arose as a result of the pathological influence of personally significant factors, while in children with schizoform spectrum disorders, factors unrelated to the life situation, personality and relationship system were usually the triggers for the manifestation of obsessional symptoms the patient. In children with emotional and behavioral disorders, the root cause of obsessions was always psychotraumatization. The structure of obsessions in children with schizoform spectrum disorders should be called “kaleidoscopic” — changeable and undependent on external circumstances. In children with neurotic disorders, a “raster” structure of obsessions prevailed — one that smoothly changed from the initial subject of obsessions. In children with emotional and behavioral disorders the “monotonous” theme of obsessions prevailed — unchanged throughout the entire period of the disease, reflecting the initial psychotraumatization. Compulsions that accompanied the appearance of obsessions in patients from G1 usually required urgent implementation, and could not be postponed even in view of the presence of external observers. Patients with disorders of the neurotic spectrum had significantly more control over compulsions and in most cases could reduce them or postpone them until a more appropriate moment. In children with emotional and behavioral disorders compulsions due to their clinical essence (obsessive memories) were often imperceptible to others. Key words: obsessions, compulsions, psychopathology, neurotic disorders, child psychiatry.",

      "title": "Child and adolescent psychiatry: general aspects of care",
      "abstract": "Child and adolescent psychiatry is a broad dis­cipline relevant to any health professional who has regular contact with young people. Childhood emotional, behavioural, and developmental prob­lems are common, especially in children with other medical or social difficulties. This chapter aims to provide an approach to child mental health diffi­culties, while Chapter 32 deals with common and/ or important psychiatric disorders that are specific to childhood. You may find it helpful to revise some basic child development— this can be found in any general paediatrics text (see ‘Further reading’). An overview of the differences between child and adult psychiatry is shown in Box 17.1. As in adult psychiatry, diagnosis of psychiatric dis­orders often relies on the clinician being able to recog­nize variants of and the limits of normal behaviour and emotions. In children, problems should be classified as either a delay in, or a deviation from, the usual pattern of development. Sometimes problems are due to an excess of what is an inherently normal characteristic in young people (e.g. anger in oppositional defiance disorder), rather than a new phenomenon (e.g. hallu­cinations or self- harm) as is frequently seen in adults. There are four types of symptoms that typically pre­sent to child and adolescent psychiatry services: … 1 Emotional symptoms: anxiety, fears, obsessions, mood, sleep, appetite, somatization. 2 Behavioural disorders: defiant behaviour, aggression, antisocial behaviour, eating disorders. 3 Developmental delays: motor, speech, play, attention, bladder/ bowels, reading, writing and maths. 4 Relationship difficulties with other children or adults…. There will also be other presenting complaints which fit the usual presentation of an adult disorder (e.g. mania, psychosis), and these are classified as they would be in an adult. Occasionally, there will also be a situ­ation where the child is healthy, but the problem is ei­ther a parental illness, or abuse of the child by an adult. Learning disorders are covered in Chapter 19. Table 17.1 outlines specific psychiatric conditions diagnosed at less than 18 years, and Box 17.2 lists general psychiatric conditions that are also commonly found in children.",

It is usually seen in young, unmarried, or recently married men of rural background with conservative attitude toward sex, generally belong to low or medium socio-economic status and education level. It can be treated with anxiolytics, antidepressants, as well as psychological interventions such as psycho-education, sex education, counseling, and cognitive behavior therapy. There is long debate regarding the nosological position of the disease and recent call for attention of psychiatrists in the subcontinent to revisit the nosological status of dhat syndrome with an unbiased mind.

      "abstract": "Introduction Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with disorganization progressive and important affecting several spheres: thought, affectivity, cognition and social life of the subject. It is a serious mental disorder with a prevalence of nearly 1%. Men would present more premorbid difficulties, but the overall prevalence of symptoms of schizophrenia is similar in both sexes. When it comes to comorbidity, men and women are vulnerable to somewhat different health issues. Anxiety symptoms are one of the main symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, but the effect of anxiety symptoms on patients is easily overlooked. About 40% have persistent anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and whether they are accompanied depressive symptoms, the symptoms may have a greater impact on the patients. We need to help patients avoid suicide when the symptoms depression appear. Hallucinations auditory, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms may exist simultaneously in patients with schizophrenia. Most studies focus on studying the relationship between auditory hallucinatory symptoms and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, the relationship between auditory hallucinatory symptoms and anxiety symptoms, or the relationship between anxiety symptoms and symptoms depressive Objectives The objective of this study is to resolve important questions concerning the interaction of anxiety and schizophrenia in patients followed in psychiatry at Arrazi Hospital . Methods Descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, conducted over a period from May 2022 to October 2022 in patients consulted in Arrazi de Salé, using a questionnaire grouping together the sociodemographic characteristics, the risks and the advantages of antipsychotics, medical comorbidities and the mobilization of psychosocial support, and thus the BPRS Anxiety Rating Scale. Results Of the 42 patients who completed the study, 18 were female and 24 were male 60% were single. The average age was 36.63 years, 60% have secondary education, 25% primary, and 15% university level, 30% have a family history of schizophrenia. 32 were taking an atypical antipsychotic, 10 were taking classic neuroleptics. Most schizophrenics encountered in psychiatry are stabilized on antipsychotic treatment, and those who have an anxious comorbidity are still too often underestimated , put on the account of the positive symptoms and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, it is insufficiently diagnosed and treated. The effect of anxiety symptoms on patients is easily overlooked. It should be kept in mind that anxiety in schizophrenia requires special attention when discussing and prescribing antipsychotic medications. Conclusions Optimal interventions for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and anxiety differ by quality of life. At all consultations, preventive strategies should consider mindful interviews and the risks and benefits of treatment for schizophrenia and comorbidities. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

In contrast to the symptoms of neurosis, psychotic symptoms are categorically outside the normal realm of experience, and as such they are beyond our common-sense powers of understanding and empathy. It is this aspect of psychotic symptoms that isolates persons experiencing them in \"a world of their own\". The availability of anti-psychotic drugs means that many sufferers today can obtain significant relief from symptoms. The experiences of persons in the grip of psychotic episodes recorded in centuries past are remarkably similar to the kinds of feelings and ideas described by sufferers. Delusions may present as part of a complex of psychotic phenomena as in schizophrenia, mania, or psychotic depression, or as the lone, predominant psychotic feature of a paranoid psychosis.

      "abstract": "Il est classique de dire que le deuil va entraîner des conséquences biopsychosociales. Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil.

      "title": "Take Caution: Look for Disturbed Behaviors When You Assess Violence Risk",
      "abstract": "Acommon misconception is that persons who are mentally ill are inherently dangerous. However, there is, at most, a weak overall relationship between mental illness and violence. Increased violence is more likely to occur during periods of acute psychiatric symptoms (1).' Because few patients evaluated in most clinical settings will commit a violent act, it is important to assess for specific risk factors for violence to guide clinical decision making. The acronym DISTURBED can be a reminder about important patient-specific features that correlate with violence. There are several variables to consider when identifying persons who are more likely to commit acts of violence. (2) Demographics. Young age, male sex, cognitive deficits, less formal education, unemployment, financial hardship, and homelessness are associated with an increased risk of violence. A person's living environment and ongoing social circumstances are important considerations when assessing violence risk. Inimpulsivity. Persons who display impulsive behaviors generally are more likely to behave violently. This is particularly true in persons who have been given a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder. Impulsivity often can be treated with medication, behavioral therapy, and other psychotherapeutic modalities. Substance use is associated with an increased risk of violence in people with and without other mental health issues. Alcohol can increase the likelihood of violence through intoxication, withdrawal, or brain changes related to chronic drinking. Some illicit drugs are associated with violence, including phencyclidine, cocaine, methamphetamine, inhalants, anabolic steroids, and so-called bath salts. Be cautious when treating a patient who is intoxicated with one or more of these substances. Threats. Persons who express a threat are more likely to behave violently (3); those who voice threats against an identified target should be taken seriously. The more specific the threat, the more consideration it should be given. In a clinical setting, the potential target should be informed as soon as possible about the threat. If a patient is voicing a threat against a person outside the clinical setting, you may have a duty to protect by reporting that threat to law enforcement. Untreated psychosis. Be aware of patients who have untreated or undertreated symptoms, including psychosis and substance intoxication. Patients in a triage setting or who are newly admitted to an inpatient unit often present the greatest risk because their symptoms have not been treated. People with paranoid delusions are at a higher risk of assaulting their perceived persecutors. Those who are highly disorganized also are more prone to lash out and commit a violent act. (4), (5) Repeat violence. The best predictor of violence is a history of violence. The severity of the violent acts is an important consideration. Even a person who has only a single (known) past violent act can pose a high risk if the act was murder, rape, or another highly violent assault. Learning details about past assaults, through reviewing available records or gathering collateral information, is important when assessing violence risk. Behaviors. There are physical warning signs that often are observed immediately before a person commits a violent act. Potential warning signs include: punching a wall or breaking objects; tightening of facial muscles; clenching of fists; and pacing. …",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by an inability to communicate or decline, impaired reality (hallucinations and delusions), unnatural or blunt affective, cognitive impairment and difficulty performing daily activities. Negative symptoms in schizophrenia causes the client impaired social function, namely social isolation. Social isolation is a disorder that causes the behavior maladptif interpersonal and social functioning disrupt a person as a result of an inflexible personality. Social isolation is one of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia are used by clients to shy away from other people so that unpleasant experiences in dealing with other people does not happen again.\r\nObjective: In order to determine the increase socialization in patients with social isolation: withdrawal after therapeutic communication in nursing.\r\nMethods: The author uses descriptive method with case studies for 3x24 hours in RSJD Arif Zainudin Surakarta.\r\nResult: The client is able to determine the patient's efforts to increase socialization in social isolation: withdrawal after therapeutic communication in nursing.\r\nConclusion: The cooperation between client, family, and health personnel is critical to the success of a nursing care.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

Children with conduct disorders, with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have an elevated risk for antisocial or psychopathic personality disorders in adolescence and adulthood. The presence of comorbid disorders such as substance abuse and schizophrenia have a strong negative predictive value with respect to the course, the prognosis, and the outcome of antisocial and psychopathic disorders. Furthermore, there are substantial gender differences. The rates for spontaneous remission and improvement of antisocial and psychopathic personality disorders are possibly relatively high. In fact, these rates are higher for women than for men. In the fourth decade of life, most of the antisocial and psychopathic personalities are in remission.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines psychosocial stressors and recurrent depression through a review of the basic literature on the subject. Stress is defined and classified from different perspectives. Stress is a cause of tension and demand or an adaptive mechanism. Stress and the presentation of the first episode of depression are directly related, however when recurrences are present signifi cant stress loses strength among the factors that trigger it. Stressors, especially the psychosocial, are related to recurrences. Chief among these are internal and external stressors, and life events, role stress and annoyances of daily living, high demands and perfectionism. Failure to accomplish goals is another factor provoking crisis in the life cycle transition. Neuroticism and perfectionism, and dysfunctional attitudes lead to isolation and lack of social support. Dysfunctional cognitive schemes lead to erroneous information processing. Depression is a pattern of relationship failing to find adaptive ways of coping with life and conduct relationships, although there are new visions that consider it as an adaptive effort. Comorbidity can lead the recurrence of depression. It has been suggested that maladaptive cognitive patterns, in particular in interaction with stressors, could lead to poor results in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder comorbidity with personality disorder. These, regardless of the state of depression have been associated with high dysfunctional attitudes.",

      "abstract": "Three types of borderline psychopathology are differentiated. Borderline schizophrenia, like schizophrenia, is characterized by impairment in the articulation of fundamental boundary differentiations. Cognitive disturbances in borderline schizophrenia are manifested as Rorschach contamination-tendency responses, wherein independent percepts tend inappropriately to fuse. Two relatively stable types of borderline personality disorder are also distinguished, both types characterized by impaired evocative constancy. Cognitive disturbances in borderline personality disorders are manifested as Rorschach confabulation responses, wherein exaggerated reactions and associations disrupt realistic thinking and perception. Anaclitic borderline personality disorder involves central concerns with abandonment and rejection; introjective boderline personality disorder involves central concerns with criticism and censure. In anaclitic borderline personality disorder, confabulatory thinking expresses intense affect elaborations and preoccupations with dependence and relatedness. In introjective borderline personality disorder, confabulatory thinking is overspecific, grandiose, and/or oversymbolic, and expresses concerns about self-worth and self-definition. These various cognitive disturbances have significant implications for differential diagnosis and for understanding both interpersonal relationships and potential for psychosis among the three borderline conditions.",

      "abstract": "The self-disorder model offers a unifying way of conceptualizing schizophrenia’s highly diverse symptoms (positive, negative, disorganized), of capturing their distinctive bizarreness, and of conceiving their longitudinal development. These symptoms are viewed as differing manifestations of an underlying disorder of ‘core-self’: hyperreflexivity/diminished-self presence with accompanying disturbances of “grip” or “hold” on reality. We have recently revised and tested this phenomenological model, in particular distinguishing primary versus-secondary factors, in offering a bio-pheno-social model of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The revised model is consistent with recent empirical findings and offers several advantages: 1) It helps account for the temporal variations of the symptoms or syndrome, including longitudinal progression, but also the shorter-term, situationally-reactive, sometimes defensive, and possibly quasi-agentive variability of symptom-expression that can occur in schizophrenia (consistent with understanding some aspects of self-disturbance as dynamic and mutable, involving shifting attitudes or experiential orientations). 2) It accommodates the overlapping of some key schizophrenic symptoms with certain non-schizophrenia spectrum conditions involving dissociation (depersonalization and derealization), including Depersonalization Disorder and Panic Disorder, thereby acknowledging both shared and distinguishing symptoms. 3) It integrates recent neurocognitive, neurobiological, and psychosocial (e.g., influence of trauma and culture) findings into a coherent but multi-factorial neuropsychological account. An adequate model of schizophrenia will postulate shared disturbances of core-self experiences that nevertheless can follow several distinct pathways and occur in various forms. Such a model is preferable to uni-dimensional alternatives—whether of schizophrenia or core self disturbance—given its ability to account for distinctive yet varying experiential and neurocognitive abnormalities found in research on schizophrenia, and to integrate these with recent psychosocial as well as neurobiological findings.",

The paper presents a Ganser syndrome in association with alcohol consumption and prohibited substances use.&#x0D; Methods: hospitalization, psychiatric evaluation under antipsychotic treatment with haloperidol and zuclopenthixol, counseling, social assistance.&#x0D; Results: The patient fulfills all the criteria for the classification in hebephrenic schizophrenia, with a reserved prognosis and an involuntary accentuated potential considering the multiple admissions, the early onset, the lack of social and family support, the absence of the obvious triggering factor, the resistance to the treatment, the probable association with the substance use. Considering school dropout and the potential subcultural context, it can be considered the presence of a mild to moderate intellectual disability.&#x0D; Conclusions: In the context of the profound dissociation of the behavior, affect and thinking, the patient associate traits from the Ganser syndrome with his vulnerable personality, which are grafted on the halls created by his absent family support and emotional neglect. The bizarre attitudes and positions along with the Ganser syndrome predict a potential catatonic episode.",

      "abstract": "Primary unipolar depression may be divided into three familial subtypes. The first of these is depression spectrum disease (DSD). It is defined as an ordinary depression in an individual who has a family history of alcoholism and/or antisocial personality. Such a person may also have a family history of primary depression but none of mania. The second subtype is familial pure depressive disease (FPDD). This is a depression in an individual who has a family history of primary depression but no family history of alcoholism, antisocial personality, or mania. The third type is sporadic depressive disease (SDD). This is an ordinary depression in an individual who has no family history of alcoholism, antisocial personality, primary unipolar depression or mania. Sporadic depressive disease has a late age of onset, usually in the late 30s or early 40s, whereas familial pure depressive disease and depression spectrum disease have an onset in the early 30s. Depression spectrum disease manifests itself by a stormy personal life, particularly with marital difficulties. Multiple episodes are seen most frequently in familial pure depressive disease. The dexamethasone suppression test differentiates between the three groups with familial pure depressive disease usually showing abnormal suppression, depression spectrum disease rarely showing abnormal suppression and sporadic depressive disease showing abnormal suppression in around 4 0% of the cases. It is noteworthy that both depression spectrum disease and secondary depression rarely show abnormal suppression with the dexamethasone suppression test. Thus, they are similar in this way. Likewise, familial pure depressive disease and bipolar depression in the large majority of cases show abnormal suppression. Thus, they are similar.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

In the given patients' group, alcoholism manifested itself atypically. The initial lack of the protective nauseous and vomiting reflex and high tolerance, relative preservation of the quantitative control, no amnesia during drunkenness, temporal break between the formation of compulsive addiction and the abstinent syndrome, manifestation of compulsive addiction only in a state of alcoholic intoxication were recorded. At the same time attention should be drawn to the frequently occurring depressive forms of drunkenness, early appearance of the asthenic state, the lack of marked personality changes by the alcoholic type, relative preservation of a critical attitude towards the disease, and to the abortive abstinent syndrome, characterized sometimes by an elevated attitude of mind resembling the hypomaniacal state. Alcoholism tends towards a moderate progredient course, which is often not realized because of the influence of psychic trauma and in that case alcoholism takes a malignant course.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to traumatic events in childhood is associated with suicidal behavior in adulthood, in the form of ideas, attempted or completed suicide. The abuse causes impaired cognitive schemes in the attachment figure, abandonment, mistrust and vulnerability to damage. The literature has demonstrated the dose–response relationship between a traumatic event in childhood and the development of mental disorders and the possibility of suicidal behavior. In addition, abuse is transmitted through the generations along with another factor of suicidal vulnerability (family history of suicide). Abuse in childhood is associated with depression, anxiety, antisocial behavior or substance. In fact, in investigations is suggested the vulnerability to any psychopathological disease. A history of suicidal behavior increases the risk for these children. Since child abuse increases suicidal behavior, we can find families in which coexists history of suicidal behavior and child abuse. The high prevalence of abuse and vulnerability neurodevelopmental leads us to consider a plan of action for this population. Rejection and/or contempt suffered in a developing brain might be related to subsequent alterations in emotional regulation or impulsivity. For these associations should conduct a more thorough screening in children's consultations to address this issue. It is very important to approach about cognitive schemes that subsequently repeated dysfunctional acts. Impulsive o unstable behavior could be reduced. This would decrease the consequences that these children have in adulthood. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

The second part of the chapter has focused on three specific neurological entities to examine evidence for a possible association between neurological illness and life stress. There is some suggestion that certain vulnerable epileptic patients can experience convulsions in response to acute emotional upheaval or certain types of cognitive challenges. More commonly, it is probable that social stress and emotional tension can produce lowering of seizure threshold by increasing levels of fatigue and disrupting sleep. The latter factor, in particular, is known to lower seizure threshold. In the case of stroke, several dramatic cases of intracranial hemorrhage have been related to disastrous life circumstances. A general association between life stress and stroke has yet to be established. The case for a link between life events and onset of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis seems stronger. Events which produce emotional upset seem capable of worsening symptoms in patients with existing disease, and several studies have reported unusual life stresses in the period preceding onset of symptoms in this disorder.",

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from schizophrenia are often portrayed in the media as being unpredictably aggressive and violent.Not only the prevalence of violence is similar in psychiatric patients and in the general population, but also many studies proved that aggression levels may be higher in the general population.Many factors, including insufficient social support to mental illnesses, drug abuse, and symptom exacerbations, can precipitate aggressive behavior.Another important major risk factor for aggression is the failure to treat schizophrenic patients adequately.Aggressive behavior and impulsivity are often found in paranoid schizophrenia and can occur during both acute and chronic phases of the illness.Impulsivity is defined as action without planning or reflection, and it seems to be related to a failure of behavioral filtering outside of consciousness.The assessment not only how aggressive patient is, but also how that aggression is manifested by studying aggression-related symptoms, including hostility, anger, and impulsivity.In this cross sectional observational study, 30 patients [16 male&14 female] aged between 21 & 56 years old diagnosed with Schizophrenia and 60 controls were recruited.This sample was totally selected from outpatient clinic of Benha Mental Hospital.All patients in the study were subjected to a detailed history taking, complete general examination, neuropsychiatric clinical assessment, a semistructured interview empathizing the sociodemographic data, the criteria of schizophrenia diagnosis and the Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire.The collected data were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS version21 software.Regarding Information obtained from ICD-10 in the studied group and types of schizophrenia: 62.5% of males and 57% of females were considered aggressive, while of the control group; 69% of females and 65% of males were aggressive.The control sample was almost as aggressive as the sample of patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia.Females and males are similarly aggressive.Patients using combined treatment of atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers had higher aggressive scores than who used atypical antipsychotics only.There is not much relationship between marital status and education and aggression.The duration of illness did not affect the type or level of aggression, nor did previous forensic history.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The association of periods of excited, volatile behavior and withdrawn, depressed behavior has long been recognized. There is current consensus that uncomplicated, classical manic depression (including episodes of euphoric mania, depression, and normal mood state) occurs in adolescents, but it is relatively uncommon in prepubertal children. However, chronic manic symptoms superimposed on a wide variety of other types of psychopathology appear to be much more common and may be a subtype of mania. The extent to which mood dysregulation in young people is part of a larger bipolar spectrum (Akiskal et al., 2000) is uncertain and under investigation. Increasingly, mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms, briefer hypomania (which people may not identify as abnormal), and dimensions of temperament are considered part of a spectrum of bipolarity. Whether bipolar spectrum is valid in children is unclear and remains controversial: outside the United States, for example, early-onset bipolar disorder is rarely reported. When it is diagnosed, it generally lacks externalizing disorder comorbidity (Thomsen et al., 1992; Reddy et al., 1997; Rasenen et al., 1998; Srinath et al., 1998). One suspects that these countries are restricting their definition of bipolar disorder to that of the classical variety.",

      "abstract": "Background There is an overlap between the symptoms of psychopathy and autism spectrum disorders. Aim To contribute to an adequate differential diagnosis of these disorders. Method We reviewed the literature with the help of PubMed, using as key words: 'empathy', 'psychopathy', 'autism', 'aggression' and 'antisocial' for the period 1980-2004. We also consulted papers listed in the bibliographic references for these articles. Results Empathic deficit is a core symptom of both disorders. In psychopathy there are signs of an emotional empathic deficit, an inability to feel along with another person (insensitivity). Research into autism spectrum disorders points to a cognitive empathic deficit, an inability to take the perspective of another person (innocence). The antisocial behaviour that can accompany both disorders might be due to the type of empathic deficit. In psychopathy the antisocial behavior often involves insensitive manipulation and exploitation ofanother person. In autism spectrum disorders there is sometimes antisocial behaviour which could be caused partly by incorrect evaluation of social situations. In both psychopathy and autism spectrum disorders dysfunctioning of the orbitoftontal cortex and the amygdala is often mentioned as a possible cause of empathic deficit. Conclusion An accurate diagnosis of the type of empathic deficit involved could help to differentiate psychopathy from autism spectrum disorders. Good diagnostic tools are not yet available.",

      "title": "ASSOCIATION BETWEEN VIOLENT BEHAVIOR AND PSYCHOTIC RELAPSE IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: ONCE MORE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The potential for violence in a number of persons with mental illnesses stimulates public fear and prevents general acceptance of persons with psychiatric disabilities. Schizophrenia has been the diagnosis most often associated with violence as it has been taken as a paradigm of insanity, incompetence and dangerousness. Clinicians’ efforts to prevent violence through conventional external patient treatment are impede by several situational variables and patients become trapped in a costly cycle of repeated institutional admissions (revolving door phenomenon) in the most restrictive settings, going through involuntary in-patient treatment. The major hypothesis proposed in this review is that violence in schizophrenia can become a part of a self-perpetuating cycle, in which the combination of non-adherence to treatment and an inadequate management of illness from families and caregivers leads to violent behavior and deteriorated social relationships, finally resulting in institutional recidivism. As some of the initial symptoms of the illness, such as irritability and agitation may not be detected by the patient and his/her family, these symptoms eventually can easily escalate into open hostility, and the accompanying behavior is frequently violent. Disturbed moods secondary to psychotic symptoms, such as fear and anger apparently can also activate violent psychotic action. Accordingly, the path from the characteristics of the illness to violence leads to them through psychotic symptoms and lack of insight, and results in symptom-consistent violence. When psychotic symptoms and violent behavior cannot be managed by caregivers, patients are brought to the attention of psychiatric services and frequently admitted to patient service. During admission for a psychotic episode, there are more violent incidents than later on in the disease. As patients respond to medication and hospital environment, violent incidents and psychotic symptoms decrease in frequency and severity. After hospital discharge, patients may assume greater autonomy and control over several aspects of their daily lives. Nevertheless, this process may be hampered by familial reactions to the burden of living with a family member with schizophrenia. This burden can also be exacerbated because many patients have a history of violent behavior and families may experience negative attitudes towards them. In line with this, there is evidence of significant differences between the professionals’ perception about symptoms and illness, and that of the patient and his/her family. Sometimes, these different conceptions may reflect a lack of awareness regarding illness and treatment that may lead to discontinue medication. Medication suspension can lead to an eventual relapse which most obvious sign is the emergence of positive psychotic symptoms. Nevertheless if a patient has a past history of violent behavior, it is very likely that these behaviors will appear during relapse and it may be necessary to consider hospitalization. Although treatment with antipsychotics may be useful when violence is secondary to psychotic symptoms, violence might be indirectly reduced through clinical programs aimed at increasing insight into illness and treatment. A psychoeducational strategy may improve antipsychotic treatment compliance by helping the patients to work through their ambivalence regarding antipsychotic medication. For families, a psychoeducation strategy can lead to a change in attitudes toward the disorder, as well as to promote problem-solving skills for violence. The model presented here suggests that violence in schizophrenia is conditioned by several factors such as psychotic symptoms, medication non-compliance and lack of social support. The prevention of violent behavior in schizophrenia should include attention to other areas, such as the quality of the social environment surrounding the patient. For the “revolving door” patients, violence may be a key factor that complicates treatment. Health professionals have the responsibility to work in partnership with patients and their families for the prevention of violence.",

      "title": "THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGHEST MENTAL CAPACITY AND PSYCHIC ABNORMALITIES",
      "abstract": "The hereditary background and the physical and mental health conditions of 294 geniuses and their families were investigated. We regret the anonymous character of the reported results and realize that the reader would be more attracted by references to definite personalities in the row of geniuses; the confidential nature of information obtained by personal interview, however, put us under obligation to omit names and personal circumstances. Without repetition of the details given in the preceding chapters, the most important results are summarized in the following conclusions: 1. There is no definite relationship between highest mental capacity and psychic health or illness, and no evidence to support the assumption that the genesis of highest intellectual ability depends on psychic abnormalities. The high number of mentally healthy geniuses speaks against such a claim and repudiates the slogan \"genius and insanity.\" Psychoses, especially schizophrenia, proved to be detrimental to creative ability. Milder psychic abnormalities within the limits of psychoneurosis such as the combination of emotional instability and psychic tension exerted in some instances a stimulating influence. 2. The geniuses were not at a disadvantage in comparison with the average population relative to life duration, fertility, and disposition to organic diseases in the sense of a diminished vitality as the price of intellectual supremacy. 3. There seems to be a tendency in the genesis of high mental faculty to manifest itself in first- and second-born children. 4. The families of geniuses do not \"die out.\" The supreme mental ability of a genius is reflected in the remarkably high number of intellectually prominent individuals among his children and grandchildren. 5. The process by nature of making a genius is obviously a very complex one and involves different not clearly understood mechanisms. A direct hereditary transmission is probable in the fields of music, painting, mathematics, and technical invention. In general, there must be a preparatory ground in form of certain talents in the ancestors, and in combination with optimal character traits without the dysharmony of strong conflicting tendencies. Manual dexterity in the ancestors of artists, rhetorical talents in those of the poets, and philosophic-theologic-didactic talent in the ancestors of scientists are conspicuous predisposing factors for the formation of a genius. 6. Eminent artistic talents were frequently found in combinations such as music and poetry, music and painting, and painting, sculpture, and architecture. 7. There seems to be a relative incompatibility or compatibility between the make-up of a genius and certain psychic dispositions. The schizothymic constitution is more prevalent among the artists and the cyclothymic constitution among the scientists, especially those in the natural science group. 8. The geniuses and their families show a much higher incidence of psychosis and psychoneurosis than the average population. Among the geniuses themselves, schizophrenia occurred only in the artists, and manic-depressive insanity only in the scientists, in a frequency 10 times the incidence of the average population. The eccentrics (schizothymic) were correspondingly more prevalent among the artists, and the emotionally unstable psychopaths (cyclothymic) were more frequent among the scientists. 9. A comparison between the artists and scientists showed a relative biologic inferiority of the artists exhibited by the higher number of psychic abnormalities among themselves and their families, the lower fertility and shorter life span, the higher number of single persons and illegitimate children, the increased infant mortality, and the higher divorce rate. No difference between the two groups existed relative to physical health. 10. The incidence of below-average intellect and imbecility is remarkably low in the descendants of the geniuses, whereas the suicide rate appears to be high. 11. The wives of the geniuses were, in the overwhelming majority, excellent marriage companions and contributed directly or indirectly to the outstanding accomplishments of their husbands. 12. The geographic-racial descent of the geniuses revealed a selective distribution of certain talents. The artists were most numerous in the southern and southeastern parts within the German-speaking boundaries, and the scientists in the northern and western districts. No district, however, was exclusively limited to either of the two groups. The greatest total number of geniuses came from the thickly populated and racially mixed middle regions of Germany and Switzerland. The optimal mixture of related races seemed to be a favorable factor for the formation of geniuses.",

      "abstract": "Many typical symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) occur within interpersonal contexts, suggesting that BPD is characterized by aberrant social cognition. While research consistently shows that BPD patients have biases in mental state attribution (e.g., evaluate others as malevolent), the research focusing on accuracy in inferring mental states (i.e., cognitive empathy) is less consistent. For complex and ecologically valid tasks in particular, emerging evidence suggests that individuals with BPD have impairments in the attribution of emotions, thoughts, and intentions of others (e.g., Preißler et al., 2010). A history of childhood trauma and co-morbid PTSD seem to be strong additional predictors for cognitive empathy deficits. Together with reduced emotional empathy and aberrant sending of social signals (e.g., expression of mixed and hard-to-read emotions), the deficits in mental state attribution might contribute to behavioral problems in BPD. Given the importance of social cognition on the part of both the sender and the recipient in maintaining interpersonal relationships and therapeutic alliance, these impairments deserve more attention.",

Boredom, restlessness, chronic ill-defined tension, and impulsiveness characterize many long-term drug-using adolescents between highs.

Academic underachievement and his tolerance to frustration is very low. Academic underachievement and intense loneliness, despite outward signs of feeling at ease, may be manifestations of a poor sense of self-worth, of apathy, and of lack of motivation that the adolescent has sought to alleviate by escaping to a drug-induced euphoric state. These feelings may also be manifested in anger toward loved ones, school, and society that intensifies as addiction progresses. Such adolescents may be brought into the pediatrician's office because they are apathetic, lethargic, volatile, chronically moody, failing in school, disrespectful, untrustworthy,",

Depression clearly has been shown to be related to outcomes after CHD has declared itself.

      "title": "We Aim To Pee: Unmasking the Secret Phobia and Reducing Performance Anxiety",
      "abstract": "There is a little known condition known as Avoidant Paruresis (AP); also known as Shy Pee or Bashful Bladder. The condition affects people's ability to urinate in public toilets, or at home when there are others present and in the growing demand for the production of mandatory urine samples. This affects some 7% of the population of Westernised countries. The problem is so severe for some that they are unable to attend work or form lasting social relationships. They will not go out with friends fearing that they will be exposed to humiliation or ridicule. The anxiety levels that many people experience further fuels the phobic state and causes lasting feelings of helplessness and depression. The secrecy is such that people with AP will not disclose this to their partners, even partners of very long standing, and will carry the burden of guilt and shame alone. In this sense AP is a living disability. This paper explores some of the possible psychological factors contributing to this condition. It will suggest factors in the personal subjective reality of the individual using the real world model. This model suggests that the perception of the person can be related to three major elements; identification, orientation, and expectation. In essence these are factors relating to: a) How the concepts and constructs learned and stored from the past are accessed, b) The dynamics of approach and avoidance behaviours in the present and c) The role of expectations about the future From this concept of personal reality the phobic state of paruresis will be examined and implications for treatment and therapy in paruresis explored. The concept of a dynamic Quality of Life for the paruretic will be introduced and elements of this related to the context of interpersonal relationships and the living environment.",

      "abstract": "Background: Musical hallucination is the subjective experience of hearing music, or aspects of music, when none is being played, and as such is a disorder of the processing of complex sounds. Objective of Review: To determine the extent to which the otological system is responsible for musical hallucination, and to evaluate approaches to clinical management. Type of Review: A review of all studies and literature reviews pertaining to musical hallucination, supplemented by inclusion of informative case reports. Search Strategy: A systematic search of multiple databases carried out on 22nd March 2009 was complemented by referral to the reference lists of included manuscripts. Results: Although not always troublesome in itself, musical hallucination can be a marker of underlying pathology in the ear or brain, or indicate obsessive‐compulsive traits or social isolation, and is likely to be clinically underreported. Associations have been reported with hearing loss, female gender, social isolation and being over 60 years of age, although it is rare even in this group, and these may well not be independent risk factors. Robust comparative analysis of these factors with controls has yet to be undertaken. Underlying causes include neurovascular pathology, psychiatric disorders and opioid medications, however these are absent in the majority of cases. Conclusions: This review supports the proposal that the otological system plays a role in the pathogenesis of musical hallucination. Hearing impairment may act as an initiating factor, and the primary dysfunction is overactivity of auditory association cortex, although an impairment of higher‐level inhibition does also seem necessary. Once underlying sinister causes have been excluded, first line treatment should be explanation of the condition and optimisation of hearing. Medications have a role only in selected patient groups.",

This involves an increased risk of developing mental disorders, such as (complex) post-traumatic stress (PTSD, CPTSD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Both within and outside of these diagnostic boundaries, complex trauma has been associated with emotional dysregulation, dissociation, distrust, interpersonal problems, and maladaptive coping behaviours, such as self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Knowledge on the devastating consequences of complex trauma has steadily increased. One of the remaining research questions is why some people develop certain psychopathological symptoms or disorders after complex trauma while others do not. Moreover, more research is needed to better understand how disorders such as BPD and CPTSD can be differentiated, both descriptively and empirically. This special issue brings together a collection of review articles and original research articles on this topic to stimulate further research in the field. Findings enhance the understanding of long-term consequences of childhood adversities and highlight important psychopathological mechanisms that may underlie an increased risk to develop certain mental disorders.",

Capgras syndrome is a 'falsely believes' that a close relative or friend has been replaced by doubles or imposters. Whereas the out of body experience -false perception- the subject feels that his/her “self”, or is located outside the physical body and somewhat elevated, from this elevated extra personal location that subject experiences seeing his body and the world. In addition, something's happening to the patient; he experiences an inability to recognize his face in mirror (autoprosopagnosia).

      "abstract": "In a previous publication (Brown and Birley, 1968) we have presented some findings which suggest that life changes and crises frequently precipitate the acute onset, relapse or exacerbation of schizophrenic states. To summarize : consecutively admitted patients diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia were seen at mental hospitals serving a known catchment area. The first fifty whose onsets occurred within three months of admission and could be accurately dated within a week were included. Both the patient and at least one other informant were interviewed about the occurrence of certain previously defined and datable events occurring to the patient or to close relatives. These included such events as moving house, starting or leaving a job, admission to hospital, birth, marriage or death during the twelve weeks prior to onset. These were classified, according to their apparent independence of the patient's control, as ‘independent’ or ‘possibly independent’. The former were those which could be regarded as outside his control, e.g. discovering a burglary or hearing of a brother's serious illness. ‘Possibly independent’ events were those which were considered to have been within the patient's control but which had not been brought about by any unusual behaviour on the patient's part. They were chiefly changes of job, or of opposite sex friends. (Loss of job would, under certain circumstances, be rated as ‘independent’, e.g. when a whole firm closed down).",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is common in people with schizophrenia. These impairments are detectable prior to any signs of illness in people who are destined to develop the disease and they are as severe at the time of the first psychotic episode as they are after many years of illness. It was formerly believed that the major decline from the minor impairments seen in childhood to those seen at the time of the first episode occurred during the prodrome. Recent data suggests that there is little cognitive decline during the prodrome and that at the detection of the prodrome, decline has already occurred. Thus, the period of cognitive decline must be very early in the prodrome to psychosis.",

In fact, the vast majority of adults— some 75 percent—with dysthymia report that their mood difficulties began while they were children or teenagers. Diagnosing dysthymia early is important, not only to improve a child’s quality of life but also to prevent problems later in life. Depressed kids may be irritable and act out, or they become passive and withdraw. They stop trying hard and do poorly in school, don’t connect much with other kids, are moody and contrary, and later become promiscuous, rebellious or turn to ways to self-medicate with alcohol or drugs. And, as in adulthood, suicidal behavior can be a consequence of feeling stuck in a hopeless existence. Although it is normal for adolescents to be moody, it is the broader, all-encompassing, and persistent changes in mood and behavior that distinguish dysthymia from normal moodiness.",

      "title": "Loneliness, the Human Condition, and Psychotherapy",
      "abstract": "Loneliness is experienced by nearly everyone, although its frequently and intensity vary widely. Existential loneliness may derive from the universal experience of separation from the mother in leaving the womb; it is an intrinsic and organic reality of each life. The other kind of loneliness comes from self-rejection and self-alienation from society and appears to be related to depression. The latter may lead to aberrant or self-destructive behavior such as drug abuse, but rarely to aggressive or anti-social behavior. There is some evidence that the ability to deal with loneliness is related to the experience of having been alone as a child in the presence of one parent, usually the mother. Without this experience, the capacity to confront loneliness is arrested; with it, a supportive environment is built into the personality. For the psychotherapist, each aspect of loneliness offers a special challenge. This paper considers some of the ways that therapists may help their patients cope with their loneliness.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "More than most branches of medical practice child and adolescent psychiatry, increasingly described as child and adolescent mental health, is difficult to define. Central foci of the subject are the developmental, behavioural, and emotional disorders of childhood and adolescence. Many include “psychosomatic” physical symptoms, such as non-organic headache, stomach pains, and fatigue, in which stress or other environmental factors appear to play important causative and perpetuating roles. Delays and deviations in development, as well as general and specific learning problems, lie in the borderland of child psychiatric practice; educational and social services are often in the vanguard in providing support and services for affected individuals and their families. Environmental factors are often important in causation, and they are often, but by no means always, accompanied or followed by significant emotional and/or behavioural disturbance. Conversely, the importance of “constitutional” biological factors, in particular genetic factors, is increasingly being recognized. Most specialists in this field recognize the need for a biopsychosocial approach to child and adolescent mental health.Children's development is inextricably interwoven with parental and carer quality of care, failures of parenting and caring, and other possible acts of commission and omission. Thus fostering of parenting skills is often seen as an integral part of child psychiatric practice. Indeed, there are some child and adolescent psychiatrists who prefer to see themselves as family psychotherapists and perceive most, if not all, child mental health problems as being attributable to distortions or deficits in either parenting ability or familial interpersonal interactions. This can often be a helpful approach, but it is important to acknowledge that, although children's problems can often be formulated in terms of interactions between the child, the family, and the wider environment, in a significant number of cases (as in childhood autism for example) a serious primary disturbance does indeed lie within the child. This will of course interact critically with prevailing familial and other social factors.Defining the territory of child psychiatry in this way makes it clear that most professional assessment and treatment of child psychiatric disorders is carried out by non-psychiatrists, and often not even by medically qualified professionals. These include family doctors, paediatricians, and clinical medical officers, as well as psychologists (clinical and educational), nurses, social workers, nursery staff, and teachers. Situations which call for the particular skills of a child psychiatrist (Graham 1984) will vary. Generally, psychiatrists are most likely to be appropriately involved where the disorder is severely disabling, handicapping, and persistent, with significant degrees of functional impairment in development and quality of life. With training, other medical and non-medical professionals can be effective in assessing and treating problems in this field of work. This book aims to enable these individuals, as well as mental health professionals, to carry out these tasks more effectively.An important characteristic of child psychiatric disorders is the degree to which they affect different aspects of the child's and the family's lives. The family of a seriously disturbed child requires the services of many different professionals, drawn especially from health, education, and social welfare services. An important principle of practice involves the need for all practitioners, no matter to which discipline they belong, to respect the contribution that others make, to be aware of the point at which another discipline may need to be involved, to acknowledge when a professional with a different background, training, and even perspective may know better than you, and to maintain as close communication with other disciplines as is compatible with professional confidentiality and the highest ethical standards.",

Patients who have body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with an ideal body image and view themselves as ugly or misshapen. Comorbid psychiatric disorders may also be present in these patients. Body dysmorphic disorder is distinguished from eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa that encompass a preoccupation with overall body shape and weight. Psychosocial and neurochemical factors, specifically serotonin dysfunction, are postulated etiologies. Treatment approaches include cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and psychotropic medication. To relieve the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, in higher dosages than those typically recommended for other psychiatric disorders, may be necessary. A trusting relationship between the patient and the family physician may encourage compliance with medical treatment and bridge the transition to psychiatric intervention.",

There\r\nis much evidence that schizophrenic patients have an increased risk for aggression and violent\r\nbehaviour, compared with general population. In addition, numerous studies indicate that\r\nschizophrenia is both neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorder, although those\r\nfindings are inconsistent across different studies. No specific abnormality is consistently\r\ndetermined to be pathognomonic neither for schizophrenia itself, nor for schizophrenia with\r\naggressive behaviour. However, discrete enlargements of 3th and 4th ventricle, frontal and\r\ntemporal lobe abnormalities, as well as deficits in the orbitofrontal and temporal cortex, were\r\nrepeatedly reported in aggressive schizophrenic patients.\r\nDistinct responses of schizophrenic patients to emotional faces were associated with\r\npoor social skills, which were, in turn, related to aggressive behaviour. Frontal lobe\r\ndysfunction is considered to play a role in cognitive, personal and behavioural component of\r\naggression (such as sensation-seeking, risk-taking, and loss of control).\r\nViolence in schizophrenia might also be related to delusions and hallucination, although\r\nthe causality is not yet well determined.\r\nPharmacological management of patients with schizophrenia and persistent aggressive\r\nbehaviour requires the use of both short-term strategies to control acute episodes of agitation\r\nand long-term treatment to reduce the intensity and frequency of future episodes.\r\nAntipsychotic medication remains a foundational choice.

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Unfortunately hovever, although the childhood and adolescence of individual psychotics often reveal premorbid deviations from established norms, while epidemiological studies identify cognitive performance and social adjustment as potential premorbid markers, such signs vary widely and no typical prodrome has been identified. Illness-related events or behaviors are not the only factors precipitating the transition from premorbid to prodrome: educational and socioeconomic status are also involved, it follows that there is a controversy surrounding the secondary prevention of schizophrenia: because of the poor specificity of premorbid and prodromal markers, treating such patients implies thai an unacceptably high proportion of individuals who will not ultimately develop florid schizophrenia will be exposed to stigma of a provisional diagnosis of severe mental illness as well as to the adverse effects of treatment Schizophrenia, therefore, is an aggravated illustration of the dilemmas facing much preventive therapy.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder and one of the most debilitating and baffling mental illnesses known. It is a disease that makes it difficult for a person to tell the difference between real and unreal experiences, to think logically, to have normal emotional responses to others, and to behave normally in social situations. People with schizophrenia may also have difficulty in remembering, talking, and behaving appropriately. Schizophrenia is one of the more serious mental illnesses and can have a variety of symptoms. This illness varies in its severity from one individual to another, and also within any one afflicted individual from one time period to another. Sometimes these symptoms come on suddenly, but most often, the illness develops slowly over months or even years. At first, symptoms may go unnoticed or may be confused with those of other conditions. For example, people with Schizophrenia may feel tense, be unable to concentrate, or have difficulty sleeping. Those afflicted also become increasingly isolated and socially withdrawn. As the illness progresses, the symptoms often become more bizarre, and are described as symptoms of psychosis. The person develops peculiar behavior, speaks nonsensically, and may develop hallucinations, that is, they may see, feel, smell, or hear things that are not really there. During the psychotic phase, people with Schizophrenia may also suffer from delusions, i.e., have thoughts that are fragmented, bizarre, and have no basis in reality. They may also develop disordered thinking and speech patterns in which the associations among their thoughts and words are very loose. Schizophrenia seems to worsen and improve in cycles known as relapses and remission, respectively. At times, patients may appear relatively normal, but usually there will be repeated episodes of the illness that will cause the symptoms to reappear. It is one of the most common serious illnesses that can cause repeated hospitalizations. Antipsychotic medications (often called neuroleptics) are very effective in controlling the symptoms of the illness. Because each person with Schizophrenia has a unique mix of symptoms no single medication works best for all people. Also, there is a high percentage of patients who do not comply with their medications due to bad side effects that they could not tolerate. However, a new generation of these antipsychotic medications has been shown to reduce the side effects, and more significantly has improved the quality of life of patients. Because of these new drugs, patients now are more integrated into society, some of them are able to graduate from college and many are gainfully employed and productive members of our society.",

      "title": "TRANSITORY SCHIZOPHRENIAS PRODUCED BY BROMIDE INTOXICATION",
      "abstract": "A bromide psychosis is one which starts during bromide intoxication and clears up fairly soon—usually several weeks, though sometimes longer—after discontinuance of the drug. Four varieties of bromide psychosis are known: 1. Simple intoxication, marked by dullness and mental sluggishness, with good orientation, and without delusions or hallucinations. 2. Delirium, marked by disorientation, thinking disturbances, mood disturbances (usually fear), delusions, hallucinations and other symptoms. The first two varieties are well known; the next two are not. 3. Hallucinosis, which differs from delirium in that orientation is intact. 4. Schizophrenia, a psychosis of predominantly paranoid coloring which, to the examiner who does not know the history and laboratory findings and has not yet seen the outcome, has all the earmarks of an \"ordinary\" paranoid schizophrenia, from which it differs only in that it is a transient psychosis which has supervened during bromide intoxication. Sometimes a bromide schizophrenia is accompanied by disorientation, a symptom which does not belong to the schizophrenic picture. In such cases it is believed that the bromide schizophrenia came first, and that delirium ensued subsequently because the drug was not stopped. Such cases are to be distinguished from those \"ordinary\" schizophrenics who, because of pre-existing psychotic symptoms, start taking bromide and take it long enough to become delirious. Anyone who takes enough bromide may become delirious, and there is nothing remarkable when this happens to an ordinary schizophrenic. It is quite different with the patient who was not manifestly schizophrenic until bromide made her so. Bromide schizophrenia differs from bromide delirium and hallucinosis in the following respects (leaving aside for a moment the basic difference between delirium and other psychoses in respect to orientation): 1. Bromide schizophrenia occurs by preference in persons with strong schizoid leanings, while delirium and hallucinosis show no such preference. 2. The characteristic schizophrenic disturbance of rapport is not found in delirium and hallucinosis. 3. The content of the schizophrenia, as in any ordinary schizophrenia, has a flavor of the bizarre: ideas of influence and mind-reading, ideas of electricity and somatic distortions are apt to be prominent. 4. In schizophrenia the patient's delusions and hallucinations are marked by heightened self-reference, which is not the case to the same degree in delirium and hallucinosis. It is concluded that bromide intoxication has the power to bring to the surface a latent schizophrenia, which, when favorable conditions have been restored, may once again go into hiding. In this respect bromide intoxication resembles many other intoxications. It is wise to examine the serum for bromide routinely in every acute psychosis, rather than to do so only \"when indicated.\" If the test is not made routinely, one will overlook some cases, for sometimes one does not suspect a bromide psychosis until an unexpected recovery has opened one's eyes, at which point it may be too late to verify the diagnosis chemically.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder defined by diagnostic criteria that include deficits in social communication and social interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Autism is a disorder with heterogeneity in phenotypes, including a spectrum of cognitive, communication, and behavioral differences and differences in etiology and outcomes. Initial signs and symptoms typically are apparent in the early developmental period. However, social deficits and behavioral patterns might not be recognized as symptoms of ASD until a child or adult is unable to meet social, educational, occupational, or other important life stage demands. Thus, individuals may not receive an accurate diagnostic assessment until they are well into adult years.",

      "abstract": "abstract Absence is characteristic of the psychotherapy of many different types of psychological disorder. However, it is perhaps particularly significant in the psychotherapy of anorexia nervosa. I hope to show that the notion of absence can help to draw together some of the many strands which go to make up this most complex of conditions. Recognition of what is absent can help illuminate the patient's unconscious conflicts and point to the capacities that she has been unable to develop. These absences arise out of early environmental deficiencies, such as a lack of containment, which can result in failures of introjection and an absence of the potential space. They can leave the child ill equipped to experience, understand or deal with her feelings, develop a secure sense of self or think symbolically. Sexual desire, aggression and envy often appear to be absent from the conscious world of the anorexic. In therapy, there is often a striking absence of feeling and of connection between patient and therapist. The work is done largely in relation to what is not talked about, felt or understood and what is apparently not happening. The therapist needs to create a space in which absence and emptiness can be thought about and symbolized, and a sense of self can begin to develop.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy differs from other chronic conditions because of the unpredictability of the seizures, the absence of an absolute diagnostic test other than video-telemetry and the stigma associated with the condition. Working from a hospital base with a biased population, one might be forgiven for thinking that most people with epilepsy have major problems either of seizure control or socially. This is naturally not the case, but the social problems of epilepsy are sufficiently frequent and/or severe to warrant comment. Simply making the diagnosis may produce parental anxiety and guilt. This is often compounded by societal misunderstanding of epilepsy and the incorrect association with mental illness. Furthermore, it is those children or adults who have severe epilepsy who stand out in society, with the tacit implication that all epileptics (people with epilepsy) are like them. There is a societal generalization that all epileptics are the same. It is not appreciated that there are many types of epilepsy (convulsive and non-convulsive) and that epilepsy varies from being very mild to intractable. Treatment also has implications: children and adolescents may not like to take, or be seen to be taking, medication. It is desirable where possible to recommend twice daily dosage with breakfast and dinner. This avoids the need to take medication to school, or in the case of adolescents, to work. In addition, compliance is enhanced with a twice daily dosage. There is without doubt a stigma associated with epilepsy which persists despite being to a less degree than in the past.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT– Thirty‐seven, out of a sample of 100 elderly subjects, all suffering from dementia, were found to have delusions. The delusions were more common in women, in patients with a history of psychiatric illness, and amongst those with higher information subscores (Blessed Scale); and were less common in patients suffering from apraxia or severe psychosocial incompetence. Amongst the deluded patients the simultaneous presence of disorientation, hallucinations and hyperactivity often signified the diagnosis of delirium, but on follow up it was not correlated with death within 18 months. The same symptoms in the non‐deluded patients were correlated with severe social incompetence and death within 18 months. It is concluded that the presence of delusions in subjects over 75 years old suffering from dementia is related, to certain extent, to previous or concomitant psychiatric illness, and that it reflects a relative preservation of mental function amongst those without such history.",

The violent shaking of the child results in devastating consequences up to death or can lead to serious neurological sequelae and/or compromise of their neurodevelopment. The clinical diagnosis of SBS is not always easy and immediate, especially in cases where the picture presents with subtle signs and symptoms not directly attributable to abuse: it is therefore fundamental that the family pediatrician is aware of this nosological entity, suspects it in the presence of certain risk factors, always considers it in the differential diagnosis like any other pathology, and above all prevents it through sensitization and education of parents and other caregivers to adequately manage their child's crying. This article aims to emphasize the role of primary care pediatricians in knowing, recognizing, and preventing the shaken baby syndrome.",

      "title": "The evolution of early psychosis with variable expression. Study of a clinical case",
      "abstract": "It is the study of a clinical observation, over a period of two years, of a 21-year-old man who often presented himself at the emergency room for severe anxiety and behavioral disorders characterized by repeated self-mutilation, psychomotor agitation, homicidal behavior toward his father, aggressive impulsivity, and sometimes antisocial behavior (running away and dangerousness). Ideas of persecution and reference often underlay his disordered behaviors. The patient also made frequent suicide attempts related to brief depressive periods, in which he verbalized great suffering that he explained by family relational difficulties and traumatic events (parental abuse, accidents). After two years, the clinical picture was aggravated by the appearance of symptoms of schizophrenia comprising paranoid delusion, hallucinations with mental automatism, social withdrawal, and affective and behavioral disorganization that had completely replaced his self-aggressive acting-out. These polymorphic symptoms initially posed a diagnostic and therapeutic problem for psychiatrists due to their persistence and repetition; these were made more complex by the sexual and identity problems that were later revealed through psychotherapeutic observation.The observation consisted of attentive listening during regular psychotherapeutic interviews that allowed to retrace the evolution of this pathology and his stabilization. The goal was to construct a clinical and evolutionary perspective taking into account the progression of symptoms over time until the onset of psychosis. Despite us being limited by a neurobiological exploration that yielded no apparent results, the semiotic analysis of the patient’s symptoms, writings, and symbols allowed us to research the different precocious phases of the disease, as well as the psychopathological analysis of his symptoms.Results: This method allowed us to determine the first symptom, to identify the initial period of disorders and their relationships with vulnerability factors (parental trauma, genetics), to describe their evolution according to age, and to trace the symptoms of psychotic transition. Our aim was to emphasize the preventive role of early treatment of prepsychotic disorders. We consider the impact of anxiety on the patient's neuropsychic development and on the genetic origins of the disease.Conclusion: We emphasize the preventive approach, which consists in detecting the subjects at risk of psychotic transition and determining an appropriate psychotherapy to avoid any recurrence or aggravation of the disorders.",

      "abstract": "High rates of diagnosable depression in adolescence, especially among young women, present challenging clinical and research issues. Depression not only portends current maladjustment but may also signal risk for recurrent or chronic depression and its associated impairment. Because depression is most often a response to stressful events and circumstances, it is important to understand the stress context itself. Individuals with depression histories are known to contribute to the occurrence of interpersonal and other stressors at a high rate, and for young women particularly, the occurrence of interpersonal stressors and conditions in turn predicts recurrences of depression, in a vicious cycle. Interpersonal dysfunction in early adolescence predicts the likelihood of continuing maladaptive functioning in peer, family, romantic, and parenting roles. The transmission of depression from one generation to the next involves not only heritable factors but also the likelihood that depressed youth become caught in life contexts of marital and parenting discord that portend dysfunction for their offspring and continuing depression for themselves.",

      "abstract": "Patient's statements or fears that they may \"go crazy\" and harm themselves or persons around them are rare, but extremely difficult for all participants to deal with. On the basis of the existing, unsatisfactory literature as well as an analysis of 196 incidents of homicidal-suicidal violence designated by German media as \"running amok\" and fulfilling defined criteria, we examined whether or not there are predictors for the degree of potential danger inherent in such threats. Impulsive, homicidal-suicidal acts of violence among patients with psychiatric disorders often occur in environments characterised by chronic psychosocial estrangement and isolation. Extremely distressing situations may trigger the course of violence, but the actual act is often planned during a seemingly peaceful interval. Personalities with a high affinity to weapons and a tendency toward acting out seem to increase the potential risks. Such events should be treated analogous to suicidal crises, with a strategy that takes the individual disorder into consideration. The parameters investigated in this paper are not sufficient, even in different combinations, to offer a satisfactory explanation or predict the occurrence of this extremely rare behaviour; further research is necessary.",

Schizophrenia is diagnosed by a characteristic set of symptoms (positive, negative, disorganisation, cognitive and affective) accompanied by a functional decline. Investigations are used to exclude other organic causes of psychosis and to provide a baseline for the negative effects of pharmacological treatments. Treatment requires a combination of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. Physical health is poor in this group of people and this is not helped by inconsistent care from health services.

However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

An intriguing question is whether the well-established abnormal neurodevelopment present in many children and adolescents who eventually develop schizophrenia is also present in bipolar patients. The literature on adult bipolar patients is controversial. We report data on a subgroup of patients with pediatric-onset psychotic bipolar disorder who seem to share some developmental trajectories with patients with early-onset schizophrenia. These early-onset psychotic bipolar patients have low intelligence quotient, more neurological signs, reduced frontal gray matter at the time of their first psychotic episode, and greater brain changes than healthy controls in a pattern similar to early-onset schizophrenia cases. However, patients with early-onset schizophrenia seem to have more social impairment, developmental abnormalities (eg, language problems), and lower academic achievement in childhood than early-onset bipolar patients. We suggest that some of these abnormal developmental trajectories are more related to the phenotypic features (eg, early-onset psychotic symptoms) of these 2 syndromes than to categorically defined Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders disorders.",

Serious medical and psychosocial issues can be overlooked or misdiagnosed if a broader perspective is not taken. Parents and medical providers of preschool children must take into account medical concerns that affect the diagnosis of preschool children with ADHD.",

The histrionic and narcissistic diagnoses are used much Jess now, in part because of pejorative, derogatory and, in the case of histrionic personality disorder, sexist associations. A person meeting diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder is generally more functional, less fragmented and more likely to be accessing private mental health services. There is considerable overlap between borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. A pervasive failure of empathy is not a criteria in the DSM-IV diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, but it was a clinically meaningful part of the old diagnostic terminology of psychopathy.",

Within each category, the degree of severity is determined and by using a multiaxial approach, different aspects of global social functioning, accompanying diseases, and characteristics of personality are assessed. Few long-term studies concerning outcome of the depressions exist. At least the following factors can be assumed to indicate a favorable outcome: minor extent of depressive symptoms at the beginning, no severe personality disorder, absence of psychotic symptoms, no alcohol dependency or major physical illness, reliable social background, intellectual functions not being impaired, and skillful choice of antidepressant drug therapy regimes.",

In addition, modifying psychological and social factors are discussed.Older adults appear to be at greater risk for major depression biologically, such as depression resulting from vascular changes, yet the frequency of depression is lower compared to younger adults. Older adults may be protected psychologically due to factors such as socio-emotional selectivity and wisdom, compared to younger adults, and perhaps relatively protected from social risks.A biopsychosocial approach to evaluating the origins of late-life depression is heuristically valuable, a continual reminder of the many factors that contribute to the onset and persistence of clinically significant symptoms in late life.",

      "title": "SCHIZOPHRENIC SYMPTOMATOLOGY IN MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "In summary, I think we should make a break with the facile generalizations that seem to simplify but really complicate and distort our work. There is no single entity of mental retardation: there are a great variety of factors, medical, psychological and social, which may impede mental growth and development. Similarly, there is no simple entity of schizophrenia: here too we encounter a variety of medical, social and psychological factors which induce bizarre distortions and disorganized patterns of behavior and development. Where the intellectual retardation dominates the picture, we are justified in labeling it descriptively as mental retardation: where the distortion and disorganization dominate the picture, we are justified in calling its schizophrenia. But we must recognize that there are many intermediate and overlapping types where we must be satisfied to describe the picture as retardation, with more or less prominent schizophrenic features. Moreover, in point of time, the clinical picture may change in any one case and latent or secondary features may become dominant. There is much to recommend Benda's(3) suggestion that cerebral defect or dysfunction present at birth is more likely to produce a picture of retarded development, while the same process superimposed later, after a period of normal development, is more likely to induce a pattern of disorganization that is called psychotic. This may be compared to the building of a small structure with a few bricks, or the later undermining or demolition of a good-sized building by removing bricks after the building is completed. In terms of research and scientific interest, it is reasonable to expect that some common etiologic factors may induce both syndromes; it can be regarded as already established that certain kinds of cerebral pathology or dysfunction can induce both retardation and schizophrenia. Post-anoxic, post-encephalitic, and phenylketonuric cerebral dysfunction can all demonstrably induce psychoses, mental retardation, or combinations of both. It is proper to suspect that other etiologic agents can do the same. At the same time, it would not be at all surprising to find that the hard core of schizophrenic cases, and the hard core of retarded cases, tend to have different types of etiology, with ganglion cell destruction and cerebral defect dominant in retardation, and toxic inhibitory factors dominant in schizophrenia. This was Kraepelin's view when he first propounded the concept of dementia praecox and there is much new work to indicate that his view may prove to be correct.",

      "title": "The Influence of Organic and Emotional Factors on the Origins, Nature and Outcome of Childhood Psychosis",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY I believe that child psychosis is not part of schizophrenia. It is a disorder which is usually associated with receptive and executive speech defects. These are often, but not always, part of a more general organic damage to the brain. Other disorders of perception are probably important in some children. Psychosis is not primarily emotional in origin and psychogenic factors usually play only a secondary role in the development of the condition. However, the child's emotional relationships may be fundamental in determining whether or not he is able to overcome his handicaps. Finally, the education received by the autistic child is a very important influence on outcome. RÉSUMÉ L'influence de facteurs organiques et émotifs sur l'origine, la nature et les conséquences des psychoses de l'enfance. Je crois que la psychose de l'enfance ne fait pas partie de la schizophrénie. C'est un désordre habituellement associéà des déficiences de parole réceptives et exécutives. Celles‐ci constituent souvent, mais pas toujours, un aspect d'une lésion organique plus générale du cerveau. D'autres désordres de la perception sont probablement importants chez quelques enfants. La psychose n'est pas principalement émotive d'origine; les facteurs psychogéniques ne jouent habituellement qu'un rôle secondaire dans le développement de cet état. Pourtant, les relations émotives de l'enfant peuvent être fondamentale pour déterminer s'il sera capable ou non de surmonter son handicap. Finalement, l'éducation reçue par l'enfant autiste a une très importante influence sur l'avenir. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Auswirkungen organischer und emotionaler Faktoren bei Ursprung, Charakter und Folgen der Kinderpsychose Kinderpsychose gehört nicht zu den schizophrenen Krankheiten. Es ist eine Störung, die meistens mit rezeptiven und exekutiven Sprechbehinderungen verbunden ist. Diese sind oft, doch nicht immer, Bestandteile einer mehr organischen Gehirnschädigung. Andere Perzeptionsstörungen sind wahrscheinlich wichtig bei einigen Kindern. Psychose ist nicht an erster Stelle emotionalen Ursprungs, und psychogenische Faktoren spielen mesitens nur eine zweitrangige Rolle bei der Entwicklung dieses Zustandes. Trotzdem können die emotionalen Beziehungsverhältnisse des Kindes von wesentlicher Bedeutung sein, wenn man feststellen will, ob es fähig sein wird, seine Behinderungen zu überwinden. Die Erziehung und Ausbildung, die man dem autistischen Kinde zukommen lässt, übt einen sehr wichtigen Einfluss auf das Endergebnis aus. RESUMEN La influencia de factures orgánicos y emocionales en los origenes, el carácter, y el progreso de la psicosis en los niños. Creo que la psicosis en los niños no forma parte de la esquizofrenia. Es una enfermedad asociada por lo general con defectos receptivos y ejecutivos de lenguaje. Muchas veces, pero no siempre, estos defectos forman parte de un dano mas general del cérebro. Es probable que otros disturbios de percepción sean importantes en algunos niños. El origen de la psicosis no es primariamente emocional, y los factores psicogénicos son generalemente de importancia secundaria en el progreso de la enfermedad. Sin embargo, las relaciones emocionales del nino pueden ser cardinales en decidir si puede o no vencer sus incapacidades. Por última, la educatión que recibe un nino autístico tiene una influencia muy importante sobre su progreso.",

      "abstract": "Our first basic hypothesis concerning the increased \" overindulgence \" of the \"only child\" according to the psychological definition of the term (hereafter referred to as \"only child\") and his associated characteristic qualities, e. g. neurotic passiveness , attitudes of indolence and pretension , inclination toward substitute gratification, lack of control, and timid evasion, has not proved valid where our patients are concerned. The \"only child\" among our patients did not exhibit these qualities any more often than our other neurotic patients. In the male \"only child\" we observed a conspicuous psychopathologic accentuation with regard to his behaviour in personal attachments. Also, provided that age groupings are the same, he is more often unmarried than other male neurotic patients, and he exhibits patterns of contact and attachment which are characterized by suspicion and remoteness . There is no indication that the \"only child\" among our patients seeks medical advice earlier or with fewer mental reservations because of his being accustomed to take advantage of outside help. In contrast to expectation, the behaviour of the male \"only child\" with regard to accepting the assistance of others is characterized by extraordinary reserve. He is not reported ill as often as the other male neurotic patients nor does hospitalization for longer periods of time occur as frequently as with them. This is interpreted as an indication that the male \"only child\" is \"healthier\" than other neurotic patients and less frequently tends to inflict injuries upon himself. With regard to his qualifications in school and in his profession the \"only child\" is particularly advanced. The question is raised as to whether the literary stereotype of the \" overindulged \" only child is in need of a certain differentiation, at least with respect to the social background of the patient. Our \"only-child\" patients originate predominantly from lower social strata and do not exhibit the classical attitudes of overindulgence any more often than other neurotic patients. Possibly \" overindulged \" patients mainly descend from the upper social classes.",

In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

With this aim we have assessed the relationship between somatoform dissociation and stress-related psychopathology (i.e. anxiety, depression, symptoms of traumatic stress, alexithymia) in a group of 250 healthy non-psychiatric and non-clinical young adults. Results of this study show that the symptoms of somatoform dissociation are significantly linked to stress-related psychopathology. Findings of this study show that the 'pseudoneurological' symptoms may be linked to stress-related psychopathological processes which indicate that also mild levels of stress may influence somatic feelings and may lead to various somatoform dissociative symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of psychoses increases with age with a number of factors leading to the increase in vulnerability and expression. They include comorbid physical illnesses, social isolation, sensory deficits, cognitive changes, polypharmacy, and substance abuse. Agitation and aggressiveness are also associated with psychosis in the elderly and frequently are the precipitating reasons for psychiatric consultation. A review of psychoses in the elderly must, therefore, consider psychotic symptoms within the context of the underlying etiologies of the psychotic symptoms. Elderly patients who present with psychotic symptoms require social, behavioral, and environmental interventions that are necessary for their safety and orientation. Given the likelihood of comorbid medical disorders and concomitant medications, the mere presence of delusions or hallucinations is not always an indication for additional medications. However, some patients may need pharmacologic intervention in order to manage the behavioral disturbance that often results from the psychotic symptoms. The atypical antipsychotics with their low propensity to produce extrapyramidal and cognitive side effects have greatly advanced the pharmacotherapy for elderly patients with psychoses.",

METHOD We examined the prevalence of autism and schizophrenia among synaesthetes and non-synaesthetic controls, and among their first-degree relatives.As predicted, autism occurred at elevated levels among synaesthetes and-we document for the first time-amongst their relatives. This was not found for schizophrenia, where a link may be expected, or in a control condition (type 1 diabetes) where we had no a priori reason to assume a link. Synaesthetes, compared to controls, were also more likely to have other synaesthetes in their family. People with three or more types of synaesthesia were more likely (compared to synaesthetes with fewer types) to have synaesthetic relatives and to report autism in themselves. People with two or more types of synaesthesia (compared to synaesthetes with only one type) were more likely to report familial autism.The results suggest a shared genetic predisposition between synaesthesia and autism, and more extreme synaesthetes may tend to hail from more neurodiverse families.",

      "abstract": "The authors reviewed available evidence regarding the status of dysphoric or mixed mania as a distinct clinical state and formulated operational criteria for its diagnosis.Studies of dysphoric mania or hypomania in patients with bipolar disorder were analyzed with regard to clinical characteristics, prevalence, demographic features, course of illness, outcome, family history, associated conditions, biological tests, and response to biological treatment.Although some studies suggest that dysphoric and nondysphoric mania are similar conditions, others suggest that, compared with nondysphoric mania, dysphoric mania may be more severe; more likely to occur in women; more likely to be associated with suicidality, a younger age at onset, a longer duration of illness, higher rates of personal and familial depression, concomitant alcohol or sedative-hypnotic abuse, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and poorer outcome; more frequently associated with cortisol nonsuppression; and less likely to respond adequately to lithium but perhaps more likely to respond to ECT or anticonvulsants.Substantial evidence suggests that dysphoric mania may be a distinct affective state. Contrary evidence, however, suggests that dysphoric mania may be a form of typical mania, a stage-related or severe form of mania, or a transitional state between mania and depression. Because the evidence may be inconsistent because of varying definitions of dysphoric mania among studies, the authors propose preliminary operational diagnostic criteria for the future study of dysphoric mania.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment during pregnancy can help a disturbed woman achieve better integration of internal resources and self-representations, thereby preventing postnatal maternal distress. The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "title": "Treatment of comorbidity in conduct disorder with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",
      "abstract": "Conduct disorder (CD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence. It is characterized by a variety of chronic antisocial behaviors, a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior that violates the basic rights of others, major age-appropriate societal norms, or both. Aggressive behavior, lying, stealing, fire-setting, and running away from home and school are the most frequent manifestations of CD and are often accompanied by hyperactivity, impulsive behavior, explosiveness, cognitive and learning problems, and poor social skills. The rate of comorbidity is high, with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) being the most common; comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders are also seen, especially in adolescents. The diagnostic process should include the use of structured interviews, and scores from reliable and valid rating scales that cover all psychiatric disorders must be considered in the differential diagnosis, because CD alone is an extreme rarity and multiple disorders are almost always the rule rather than exception. Treatment should include parenting skills training combined with training of the child to improve his or her relationships with peers, academic performance, and compliance with legitimate demands of authority figures. The appropriate use of medications and integration of patient/parent education and support, as well as individual, group, family, residential, and inpatient treatment may be beneficial for patients with CD and ADHD. The article describes a number of psychopharmacological agents that are used in patients with CD with ADHD and other comorbid disorders. Drugs that may be useful include psychostimulants; atomoxetine (Strattera); antidepressants (imipramine [Tofranil], desipramine [Norpramin]); Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs); atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone (Risperdal); or mood regulators including lithium (Eskalith).",

Un alto porcentaje se asocia a trastorno del lenguaje, disfunciones sensoriales, trastorno por deficit de atencion, bipolaridad, discapacidad intelectual o epilepsia, entre otras comorbilidades. Se estima que aproximadamente un 30% de los ninos con autismo, con desarrollo tipico inicial, pueden presentar regresion en los primeros anos de vida, lo cual ya fue comunicado por Kanner en uno de sus casos originales. Se denomina regresion a la perdida de habilidades sociales, comunicativas o motoras. Es esencial estar atentos ante cualquier cuadro de regresion autista, ya que no siempre es una manifestacion habitual inespecifica del espectro clinico de autismo.

We report the case of a 50-year-old man with SD accompanied by stereotypic behaviour who committed suicide despite not being in a depressive state. He initially had major depressive disorder accompanied by suicide attempts, but he gradually showed remarkable impairment in single-word semantic comprehension, naming memory, and facial recognition memory. After the diagnosis of SD, his suicidal behaviour by hanging with a cord became stereotypic and lacked seriousness. He repeatedly attempted to hang himself and finally completed suicide. The present report suggests that the risk for suicide in SD is increased not only by the presence of a depressive state, but also by stereotypic behaviour related to suicide attempts before the onset of the disorder.",

Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "title": "Risk, Disorder and Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and the presence of restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. Making a first diagnosis of ASD in adults has certain difficulties, including inaccurate recall of developmental history and overlapping behaviors with other psychiatric conditions. This case study presents a young man who was assessed to have no major mental illness during his first visit to emergency services in a psychiatric hospital. During his second visit, he was initially assessed to have first episode psychosis, due to his possible delusional beliefs related to the insurance payout, social withdrawal, and strange behaviors, and then later he was assessed to have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) instead of psychosis, because of his recurrent and intrusive thoughts. Eventually, his diagnosis was revised to ASD during outpatient follow-up after more comprehensive assessment. It is not easy to differentiate ASD from psychosis among some adult patients, even for expert psychiatrists. Cognitive rigidity in ASD may be similar to delusions in psychosis. Unusual behaviors in ASD can be confused with disorganized behaviors in psychosis. Differentiating ASD from OCD can be a complicated task as well, due to similarities between ASD and OCD. Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors in ASD may be perceived as obsessions and compulsions in OCD. Overall, diagnosis of ASD in adults requires comprehensive evaluation. Distinguishing symptoms of OCD and psychosis from autistic traits is critical for accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment. Although research in adult ASD has expanded alongside increased prevalence statistics over the past few years, more efforts to enhance the diagnostic processes in adult ASD are needed to reduce the challenges in this field.",

      "title": "A transient personality disorder induced by football matches.",
      "abstract": "Personality disorders are a class of mental diseases characterized by inflexible and maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience, involving several areas of functioning, such as affectivity, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking and reaction to stress factors. In the literature, personality disorders have always been described as stable patterns of long duration, and their onset can be found during adolescence or early adulthood. These patterns are associated with significant distress or impairment in a patient's life in which a main element affects every aspect of living, and in which no biological or other pathologies exist to assist in its identification. Therefore, they often lead to comorbidities such as dysfunctional anxiety, drug abuse, major depression and suicide.We present a case of a 37-year-old man, who came to the outpatient department needing support to quit smoking. During the follow up, he described some transitory changes in his personality while watching football (soccer) games. These episodes were characterized by inappropriate anger crises, rapid and dramatic shifts in emotional tone, dysphoria and superstitious and magical beliefs with paranoid elements; connecting himself, his family and friends to players in the match and to the unfolding of the game. Every manifestation was induced by the football match, and there were no signs of difficulty in handling impulses and in managing relationships, or any superstitious beliefs, outside of it.The combination of all the symptoms led us to think about a diagnosis of the borderline personality disorder. There was a lack of managing impulsivity, intense uncontrollable emotional reactions, and episodes of psychotic decompensation with unreal and paranoid connections made between the patient's entourage and the results of the match.With this case, we propose to consider the personality disorder, not just as a stable and inflexible pattern, but also as a transitory dysfunction induced by stress factors, as in this case, a football match, introducing therefore a new entity: transient personality disorder.",

In 17 cases the family or friends were worried about the patient's health. In eight, nervous or mental symptoms were rather marked. In 43 no abnormality of behavior was noted. There seemed to be no psychiatric symptom-complex common to lipodystrophy, aside from self-consciousness and the tendency to share in the alarm of friends and relatives. Psychiatric symptoms when present seemed on the whole to be psychoneurotic. No constant neurologic symptoms or signs were observed accompanying lipodystrophy. Although weakness is a usual symptom at one stage or another of lipodystrophy, no general symptom-complex or diseases can be considered closely related to it until more cases are available for study. Nervous symptoms in all cases resulting from self-consciousness over personal appearance are not constantly present. No conclusive evidence has been collected to support the theory that the integrity of the nervous system is affected by the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BPD), probably the most prevalent psychotic disorder in adults, has been relatively neglected or controversial in children and adolescents over the past century. We reviewed the literature on early-onset BPD. Estimates of prevalence, particularly before puberty, are limited by historical biases against pediatric mood disorders and by formidable diagnostic complexity and comorbidity. Although clinical features of pediatric and adult BPD have similarities, pediatric cases probably cannot be defined solely by features characteristic of adult cases. Onset was before age 20 years in at least 25% of reported BPD cases, with some increase in this incidence over the past century. Pediatric BPD is familial more often than is adult-onset BPD, may be associated with a premorbid cyclothymic or hyperthymic temperament, and can be precipitated by antidepressant treatment. Pediatric BPD episodes frequently include irritability, dysphoria, or psychotic symptoms; they are commonly chronic and carry high risks of substance abuse and suicide. BPD is often recognized in adolescents, but the syndrome or its antecedents are almost certainly underrecognized and undertreated in children. Controlled studies of short- and long-term treatment, course, and outcome in this disorder remain strikingly limited, and the syndrome urgently requires increased clinical and scientific interest.",

The hysteroid personality is mainly characterized by a strong need for social attention and respect as well as by a lack of emotional genuiness. For the diagnosis of hypochondriacal and hysteroid personality tendencies, a Hypochondria-Hysteria Inventory was developed and employed in 13 different samples with a total of 1206 persons. The index scores of the individual degrees of hypochondriacal and hysteroid tendencies were demonstrated to be of sufficient reliability. There was no important relationship between the individual degrees of hypochondriacal and hysteroid tendencies. Hypochondriacal tendencies are significantly correlated with general anxiety, neuroticism, depression, inhibition and psychasthenia as well as with a general negative self-concept. There is only a weak and partial significant relationship to the degree of introversion. The intensity of hypochondriacal tendencies increases with age. Hysteroid personality tendencies are significantly associated with extraversion, a certain degree of aggressiveness as well as with unconcern and sociability. The intensity of hysteroid tendencies in older adults is lower than in adolescents and young adults.",

First, attachment insecurity and disorganization characterize patterns of child/caregiver relationship that represent risk factors for later psychopathology. Second, so-called attachment disorders are categorical disorders of disrupted attachment usually associated with early social deprivation, neglect or maltreatment. These latter include both disinhibited attachment disorder, which reveals itself in indiscriminate sociability, and inhibited attachment disorder. In cases of attachment insecurity, various forms of intervention with parents appear to have effectiveness in increasing parental sensitivity but their impact on attachment per se is less clear cut. These interventions appear to work best when they are relatively brief and specifically target caregiver sensitivity. In more severe cases, especially those involving attachment disorder, interventions may require placement of the children in adoptive homes. ‘Holding therapy’ lacks empirical support and may pose serious risk to children.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Currently, psychodermatological disorders are classified under different criteria exhibiting several limitations, and no single universal classification system exists. Herein, we discuss previous suggested classifications in psychodermatology, highlighting their limitations, and we propose a new classification system, without redundant information and with accurate terminology, incorporating the relevance of the terms “disorder,” “disease,” and “illness” in psychodermatology. In this new classification, the following three groups are then suggested: “primary psychodermatological disease,” to include primary dermatoses, where psychological stress, a psychological mechanism, and/or psychopathology are some of the main elements that are recognized in the etiopathogenesis (which may induce and/or worsen a primary dermatosis); “primary psychodermatological illness,” to include skin symptoms, with or without secondary self‐induced skin lesions (such as excoriations), without a primary dermatosis, and where psychopathology, psychological characteristics, and/or a neuropathic mechanism, where stress plays a relevant role, are key features responsible for the skin symptoms and the secondary skin lesions; and “secondary psychodermatological disorder,” to include medications prescribed in dermatology with psychiatric consequences and medications prescribed in psychiatry with dermatologic consequences. Our goal with this system is to broaden the recognition of psychodermatology and improve patient management, with practical and scientific relevance for dermatologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists working in psychodermatology, but also for general practitioners, physicians from other medical and surgical specialties as well as specialists in esthetic dermatology, who frequently encounter patients with psychodermatological disorders.",

Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation.

Major comparisons were made between schizophrenics with FRS at follow-up and schizophrenics with psychotic symptoms exclusive of FRS. Positive findings in select areas of outcome functioning argue for the utility of FRS. However, several findings indicated that FRS were not more effective than non-Schneiderian psychotic symptoms in delineating central characteristics of the schizophrenic syndrome; they may identify a subgroup of schizophrenics with a more chronic course, but they do not appear to have the unique importance or diagnostic specificity that has been accorded them.",

The concept of health and disease varies with the sociocultural context. It is important to know the cultural characteristics to exercise good clinical practice. The stigma surrounding mental illness is widely known, and is even stronger in the Roma community, leading to marginalization and shame. Objectives We present a case of a gypsy woman misdiagnosed from the age of 8 with hebephrenic schizophrenia. Methods Patient frequents the emergency department with symptoms of predominantly anxiety, including episodes of psychomotor agitation, self-harm, verbalization of visual hallucinations of a mystical-religious nature. In treatment with antipsychotics since diagnosis, with no therapeutic adherence. It is observed during all the episodes how the anxiolytic treatment, even, sometimes, the verbal restraint, make the symptoms subside. Psychotic symptoms over the years are ruled out. Results Due to the diagnosis, this patient has been relegated from the gypsy community, she has not married or had children (an important milestone in gypsy culture), this has generated an exponential increase in anxiety symptoms and home problems. Conclusions It is important to know the cultural traits to which the patients we treat in consultation belong, and how the disease can affect their lives, and a simple diagnosis can be a source of greater anxiety.

      "abstract": "Abstract Illness behavior refers to the ways in which symptoms are perceived, understood, acted upon, and communicated and include facial grimacing, holding or supporting the affected body part, limping, using a cane, and stooping while walking. Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

      "title": "Postpartum Delirium: A Psychosis Born in the 18th Century",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and childbirth are moments of great vulnerability in a woman’s life, which can predispose her to the development of psychopathology, ranging from transient depressive symptoms (“baby blues”) to psychotic symptoms. Postpartum delirium is the psychiatric syndrome that some authors refer to as puerperal psychosis par excellence. It was first described in the 18th century and were thought to be associated with painful delivery, then became rare after the introduction of effective analgesia. Objectives The objective of this work is to contribute to a better understanding of this condition, through a literature review. Methods Bibliographic research using Pubmed® and the keywords: postpartum delirium. Results Clinical presentation of postpartum delirium includes: constantly varying degrees of consciousness; perplexity; hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations of one or more organs of sense; delusions or delusive-type thoughts; great motoric unrest and considerable motoric and verbal abandon; and acute aggressive discharges can also occur. It is thought to be due to organic complications, such as infectious disease, abnormal loss of blood, thrombosis, neurological disease, obstetric disease, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes. An article from 1975 mentions how difficult was to treat postpartum delirium despite the development of psychopharmaceutical therapy. The patients remained psychotic for long periods and had many relapses. They mention a comparative study that found that the symptomatic treatment of this syndrome with a combination of perfenazine and lithium carbonate produced relatively favorable results. For that reason, at that time, it was the medication of choice. Nowadays the psychopharmacological treatment of puerperal psychosis, in general, still consists of the combination of lithium and an antipsychotic, such as haloperidol, and possibly a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. Conclusions Postpartum delirium is rarely mentioned in the literature and just a few cases have been described. It is considered a rare postpartum psychotic condition but would perhaps be less rare if its existence were recognized. On this note, it is important for clinical practice to research on the psychoses of pregnancy and not just the most common. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

There is, however, a remarkable increase in schizophrenia during adolescence. Age and developmental stage also influence symptoms, course, and outcome. The evidence for a male preponderance in the very early-onset group (< 14) does not apply for adolescents over age 14. The presence of positive and negative precursor symptoms can be demonstrated in child and adolescent schizophrenia before the first clinical manifestation leading to inpatient treatment. With regard to pharmacologic treatment, atypical neuroleptics such as clozapine can be used successfully. As to outcome, schizophrenic psychoses with early manifestation have a poor prognosis. The patients' premorbid personality also seems to be of great importance: A poor prognosis can be found in patients who were cognitively impaired, shy, introverted, and withdrawn before the beginning of their psychotic state.",

In addition, children with ADHD are at increased risk for developing alcoholism and other drug addictions, especially if alcoholism or ADHD exists in other family members. Alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse may develop earlier in life (i.e., in midadolescence) when ADHD is accompanied by certain behavioral or mood disorders. The nature of the link between ADHD and AOD use disorder is unknown, although the association may be mediated by the co-occurring disorders just mentioned. In addition, ADHD-related AOD abuse may develop initially as an attempt to alleviate symptoms of mental distress associated with chronic failure, feelings of inadequacy, and conflict with parents and peers.

Emotional dysregulation can express itself both as emotional instability (i.e. an inability to modulate affects than can become uncontrolled) or in terms of poor emotional awareness (i.e. emotional numbing, alexithymic features). Whereas the first dimension is closely related to symptoms, such as impulsivity, suicidal behaviours or inappropriate anger, the latter can be associated with dissociative experiences and chronic feeling of emptiness. Although both dimensions have been related to negative experiences during childhood, however, little is known about the specific developmental pathways leading to emotional instability or emotional awareness in borderline adolescents.

The data have indicated that patients suffering from schizophrenia and their families not rarely have experienced social distancing, exclusion and rejection not only from the general public but also from mental health professionals. In general, respondents are fearful of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and desire emotional distance from them. The public attitudes tend to characterize people suffering from schizophrenia as dangerous, unpredictable, unreliable and so on.

      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, the focus of psychiatry has been to assess the clinical presentation of so-called 'disorders of the mind' and define diagnoses in order to establish successful therapeutic strategies. However, psychiatrists have become aware of the fact that this is not enough. Indeed, only a small percentage of patients discharged from hospital after their first episode of mania or psychosis, for example, had full syndromal and functional recovery in the long-term.1 Furthermore, social and vocational recovery is even more difficult to reach than clinical compensation.1 As a consequence, a shift towards a relatively new paradigm called 'positive psychiatry' is necessary. Not only prevention in general and primary prevention in particular, but also mental health promotion should be the focus of this approach. In clinical practice, positive psychiatry should promote well-being, personal growth and the reduction of perceived stress. Its background relies on certain psychobiological traits, mainly resilience, optimism and coping strategies, which can be promoted, and also on environmental factors, such as family dynamics, social support, and access to medical and psychological care.2 The three levels of prevention in mental health could be feasible targets of positive psychiatry interventions. Firstly, primary prevention is aimed at preventing the occurrence of a disease. This is done by preventing exposures to hazards or increasing resistance to a disease. An example of this is provided by the global pandemic situation. The ongoing vaccination campaign against the SARS-CoV-2 is aimed at preventing infection in an increasingly large part of the population. Nowadays, a similar, even though less extensive, effort is conducted in mental health to improve mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities in the face of future stressful events.3 This should be particularly promoted in individuals at higher risk of developing a psychiatric disorder, such as siblings of individuals suffering from a psychiatric condition. Interestingly, Kessing et al.4 in a recent nationwide population-based longitudinal study identified that the rates of presentation of any psychiatric disorder in siblings of patients suffering from bipolar disorder (BD) were increased not only in their 20 s but also above 60 years of age. As a consequence, preventive strategies should be provided not only during adolescence but should be implemented throughout life. In the case of individuals that have already experienced psychiatric symptoms, secondary prevention aims to reduce the impact of a disease that has already occurred. Providing targeted help and support to patients in their early stages is of paramount importance.5 Social, clinical and cognitive factors associated with more resilient trajectories of psychosocial functioning in the long-term in patients that presented a first episode of psychosis have been identified, providing insights for early interventions. Hence, less severe depressive and negative symptoms, a better premorbid adjustment and a diagnosis of BD and related disorders in comparison with schizophrenia and other psychoses were identified as clinical features associated with mild impairment and improving psychosocial functioning in the course of the disease.6 An important aspect of this 'new' paradigm in psychiatry is that not only the clinical condition but also other characteristics of the individual should be the focus of early interventions. An example is cognitive reserve, which is gaining momentum since it contributes to neuropsychological and functional outcomes in patients, particularly in those at the earlier stages of disease.7 Indeed, cognitive reserve represents a measure of 'intellectual resilience' since it was conceptualized as the contribution of premorbid intelligence quotient, years of education and leisure activities in promoting more efficient cognitive networks and therefore, allowing better clinical, cognitive and psychosocial outcomes over the long-term.8 Not only personal skills but also the social environment plays a major role in individual functioning. In particular, the family environment, being the first environment with which the individual comes into contact, can exert its effect as a protective or a risk factor depending on the family dynamics. Two years after a first psychotic episode,9 worse psychosocial functioning in psychotic patients has been seen to be associated with lower rates of active-recreational and achievement orientated family environment and with higher rates of moral-religious emphasis and control in the family. Similarly, in those suffering from a mood disorder, worse psychosocial functioning was associated with higher rates of conflict. This might have important implications for early interventions programs that should engage not only patients but also their caregivers. Again, the COVID-19 pandemic provides a useful example of how positive psychological traits are important even when stressful and unpleasant conditions occur. Particularly, resilience is a topic of increasing interest since it could provide a new framework to understand trajectories of mental illness, particularly in terms of improved mental health outcomes. Resilience is a dynamic process of adaptation to challenging life conditions encompassing several aspects of personal resources and can be identified as the 'emotional version' of cognitive reserve. A recent study10 evaluated mental health outcomes associated with bad resilience and predictors of good resilience in a sample of psychiatric patients and in the general population after the lockdown measures have been imposed by the Spanish government to overcome the contagion situation. Whilst the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with bad resilience, having pursued hobbies and conducted home tasks as well as a higher level of organization in the family were predictors of good resilience in psychiatric patients. Interestingly, a controlling family was associated with bad resilience even in those participants without a psychiatric condition. Therefore, therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing resilience,10 healthy life-style behaviours,11 coping strategies12 and peaceful family environment might have important implications in terms of mental health outcomes, not only in those patients already suffering from a psychiatric condition but also in the general population. Both primary and secondary preventive interventions aimed at promoting good mental health in young people, improved quality of life, insight, cognitive and social skills, physical and sexual health as well as academic and occupational functioning.13 Nonetheless, the quality of the evidence of interventions aimed at increasing subjective well-being and aspects of positive psychiatry is still low.14 Finally, tertiary prevention aimed at supporting patients with mental health disorders to have a good quality of life and better psychosocial outcomes, has also demonstrated to have an impact on prognosis. Indeed, patients who receive care through specialized treatment programmes have better illness outcomes than do those without this support.15 Interventions applying positive psychiatry concepts should be improved and provided to the different subjects being the targets of all prevention levels. Positive psychiatry can open new avenues of treatment strategies, which go beyond the traditional psychiatry approach.2 Firstly, when applied to the general population, these interventions might promote good mental health and avoid 'medicalisation'. Moreover, in those individuals at higher risk of developing a psychiatric disorder, the occurrence of the disease can be prevented or softened. Finally, patients both in the early and in the late stages of the disease can benefit from these interventions, since they could reduce disabling symptoms, improve psychosocial functioning and allow the patients to feel empowered to manage their own life, avoiding stigma, enhancing awareness and increasing quality of life. This is indeed the time to bring together positive psychiatry and precision psychiatry.

The negative symptoms are named as primary or idiopathic if they are present at beginning of the disease or if it is specific to the disease. If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Summary Objective Schizophrenia is a severe mental disor- der that compromises psychic activity, emotions, self-perception and social in- teractions and causes social impairment and disability. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately 1% in the general population and increases 5-10-fold in relatives of schizophrenic patients; the highest rate is reported in children of two schizophrenics, 50% of whom develop schizophrenia, and decreases in more distant relatives. Concordance rates for schizophrenia are 4-fold higher in monozygotic twin pairs (50-60%) than in dizygotic ones (10-15%), which reflects the propor- tion of shared genes in the two twin groups. Susceptibility genes for schizo- phrenia have been found on chromo- somes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 20, and 22. Neurocognitive functions such as attention and working memory are impaired in patients with schizo- phrenia and their relatives. Cognitive deficits are endophenotypes that con- fer susceptibility to schizophrenia and influence its outcome. Rehabilitation therapy reduces cognitive impairment and improves the outcome of schizo- phrenia. Environmental factors are also associated with the onset of schizo- phrenia, such as obstetric complica- tions which lead to perinatal hypoxia, viral infections (CMV; influenza virus), use of cannabis and psychostimulants, and stressful life-events. Environmen- tal factors contribute to the develop- ment of schizophrenia in individuals at increased genetic risk. This paper re- views schizophrenia endophenotypes and related genes to analyze the role of genetics in psychiatric rehabilitation; in addition, it discusses some genes that control sensitivity to environmental risk factors in individuals who develop schizophrenia, in order to develop new models for prevention.

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

      "title": "The causes of schizophrenia in adolescents",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the ten most disabling diseases in the world, mainly manifested by different syndromes such as incoordination of mental activity and behavior. Its pathogenesis and influencing factors are still unclear. Schizophrenia occurs mainly in patients who are in adolescence or just entering adulthood. Men are more likely to get the disease than women, and the disease course is longer, and is prone to recurring, exacerbating, or worsening. Research shows that the main causes of schizophrenia can be divided into psychosocial and biological factors. Among the social psychological factors, such as abnormal personality, it may lead to contradictory psychological phenomena; among family factors, the economic level is low, the family relationship is bad, and major psychological shocks are encountered; or social factors such as religious beliefs may lead to schizophrenia disease. Among the biological factors, schizophrenia can be caused due to the poor condition of genes. Genetic factors are the main pathogenic factors of schizophrenia. ErbB4, Dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1), Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), neurotransmitter dopamine and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes are biological factors that lead to schizophrenia. This article mainly discusses the etiology of adolescent schizophrenia. Risk factors for schizophrenia are abnormal personality and adverse genetic factors. By far the most important causative factor is due to biological genetic factors. In new scientific research, CRISPR technology may be able to cure genotype schizophrenia by modifying genes. However, maintaining a healthy mind or seeking medical attention when a problem is discovered can prevent mental illness in time.",

It was noticed that in depression past achievements appeared to be foreign to the patients. This was described in among other terms as \"emotionally empty judgments\". Analyzing the clinical picture of hypomanic states, stress was placed on the notion of the coexistence of logical thinking (and in some cases these thinking patterns are concerned with a feeling of heightened cognitive ability) with thinking styles based on logical errors.

The neurobiological and psychological mechanisms through which adverse early life experiences confer risk are poorly understood.Alterations in brain structure and function in limbic and prefrontal cortical regions have been linked to early negative experiences and to mood disorders.There are a number of psychological domains that may be dysfunctional in people with mood disorders, and which, if the dysfunction occurs prior to onset of mood symptoms, may signify a risk factor for depression. Cognitive dysfunction has been examined in patients with mood disorders, with some suggestion that changes in cognitive function may antedate the onset of mood symptoms, and may be exacerbated in those who experienced early negative trauma. Social cognition, including emotion comprehension, theory of mind and empathy, represent under-studied domains of psychological function that may be negatively influenced by early adverse experience. Temperament and personality factors may also leave people vulnerable to mood instability.This review summarizes the evidence for dysfunction in each of these domains for people with mood disorders.",

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

      "abstract": "In persons with impaired social regulation, the balance of value-need regulation is shifted towards the predominance of needs. Directions in their life are absent or their set is very limited. Their behavior is frequently situation-dependent. Social and psychological dysadaptation results from that the individual inadequately appraises the life situation and hence inadequately responds to the latter. The socially unacceptable behavior becomes normal up to criminogenic (theft, violence). In the homeless with tuberculosis, a change occurs in the structural hierarchy of vital activity motives by the motive-for-objective type. In this connection, there is a paradoxical attitude towards the disease for the purpose of acquiring a social benefit. In the homeless, the factors that are frustrating and inducing stress in ordinarily persons cause no emotional responses. This was a result of the mental defense worked out under constant stress.",

The disease is often manifested as perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Positive symptoms refer to abnormal or hyperactive mental functions, including abnormal sensations (visual and auditory hallucinations), delusions, confused thoughts, disorganized speech and behavior, etc. Negative symptoms refer to reduced or absent mental functions, including lack of motivation, lack of pleasure, social withdrawal, reduced willpower, etc. Cognitive deficits include impaired attention, decline in executive function and working memory, etc. Although the use of chlorpromazine in 1950 cured or alleviated the psychiatric symptoms of most SCZ patients, there were still 20% of the patients who were drug-resistant or dissatisfied with psychotropic treatments. So far, SCZ treatment mainly includes medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychotherapy, and rTMS treatment.",

The onset of psychotic symptoms during the postpartum period is considered a psychiatric emergency. This usually occurs in the first two weeks after childbirth. The etiology of postpartum psychosis is not fully known, but genetic and hormonal factors appear to be related. Women with history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder, family history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder, first pregnancy and recent discontinuation of lithium have increased risk to develop postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis usually presents as a combination of psychotic and mood disorder symptoms. In some cases, patient's mental status is altered. These women have a higher risk of suicide and infanticide. Other causes of psychosis should be excluded, such as intoxication or drug withdrawal, metabolic encephalopathy, endocrine dysfunction or central nervous system lesions. An acute approach should include hospitalization, antipsychotic medication and treatment of the underlying disorder. Prophylactic treatment with mood stabilizers should be considered in women previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis episodes can be severe and prolonged, and may affect bonding between mother and infant.",

      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much.

An equivalent deficit of expression of the same primary facial emotions in schizophrenics has not been clearly established. Twenty chronic hospitalised schizophrenics and 20 normals were therefore tested on tasks of facial emotional expression upon verbal command, of facial emotional expression imitation, and of non-affective bucco-facial praxic imitation. Results indicate that chronic schizophrenics do manifest a deficit of facial emotion expression which can best be explained by task parameters, such as verbal cueing of emotions, perceptual recognition, and bucco-facial dyspraxia in decreasing order of importance. The deficit does not appear to result from neuroleptic or anticholinergic medication nor length of hospitalisation or disease.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic reactions in the context of meditation and esoteric practices have been described in the psychiatric literature. In most cases, these psychotic conditions are transient and do not lead to functional impairment. The authors present the case of a 46-year-old woman who had worked as a spiritual healer for several years and, in the course of this occupation, increasingly developed a highly specific configuration of psychotic symptoms (all of which could be convincingly traced back to the formerly used spiritual techniques) along with depressive symptoms and severe functional impairment. The differential diagnosis was initially complicated by the relative conformity of the patient’s psychotic symptoms with her occupational practices and the absence of other, more typical, symptoms of schizophrenia. Only a thorough anamnesis with another spiritual healer and precise identification of psychopathology helped to disentangle the merely uncommon from the pathologic features of this case. Possible mechanisms of psychotogenesis are discussed in light of the literature and the specific features of the presented case. Although a single case report cannot prove a causal link between spiritual healing and development of psychosis, the patient’s specific psychopathology, with preeminently disturbed self-experience, and its consistency with the patient’s spiritual practices suggest at least a contributory role in this case.",

      "abstract": "In this work I tried to classify Anorexia nervosa into two groups, the central group and the reactive group. The central group contains four different subgroups, the immature, the schizoid, the hysterical and the compulsive type. In the first two subgroups the lack of appetite appears primarily at the onset of the disease, and the fear of growing up plays an important role. In the latter two subgroups the lack of appetite comes later on the basis of a conscious or subconscious suppression of the appetite; here prevails a wish to be slender and the disturbance of the aesthetic value orientation. The basis of this syndrome lies in the interpersonal constellation in the family during the childhood. In tests and interviews of the parents of 20 patients was proved, that the fathers have weak and immature character structures, show little interest in the family, they are hypochondriacl, undecisive and not self-confident. On the contrary the mothers are more normative and they endeavour to accept or compensate some parts of the father-role. In the course of these excessive efforts they lose their motherhood and become secondarily dominating grumbling persons. By the lack of the normal father-daugher-relationship, the maturation of sexuality and feminity is disturbed. The method of psychotherapy of those ambivalent, unmotivated patients with ego-splitting is different from that of other neuroses in many points, such as activity, flexibility and educational control on the part of the therapist instead of the psychoanalytic neutrality. In such cases therapists should not be reluctant to act as an object of identification for these patients.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

      "abstract": "Psychological traumas may occur during childhood in the form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional neglect. Trauma may be experienced when a person experiences serious loss or his/her life is under grave threat. If such traumatic event is neither dealt effectively nor resolved completely, it may predispose such a person to development of mental health issues such as drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS). Persons who experience or suffer from childhood psychological trauma tend to consume alcohol in order to cope with their trauma related experiences. Hence, generally, onset of alcohol dependence is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Childhood psychological trauma especially emotional abuse acts as a risk factor for the development of alexithymia in later life among persons with alcohol dependence. Alexithymia is a state of emotional dysregulation, which is characterized by the triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in distinguishing between the physical sensation and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others, which is known as externally oriented style of thinking. Alexithymia is itself a risk factor for the development of ADS. Thus, both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia play a significant role in the development of ADS. Findings of the present study showed that childhood psychological trauma(s), alexithymia, and ADS are interconnected. The present study findings conclude that significant relationship exists between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS.",

      "title": "12. IMPAIRED PERCEPTION OF ONE’S OWN BODY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: NEW EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE",
      "abstract": "Self-disturbances in schizophrenia include symptoms such as depersonalization, fuzzy demarcation between one’s own body and others, feelings of body disintegration or dislocation, the feeling of a distance between oneself and the world, and experiences of time fragmentation or disappearance. These are only a few examples of symptoms related to bodily or ‘minimal’ self-disturbances, which have been described both in patients with prodromal symptoms and chronic schizophrenia. Contrary to agency disorders, the listed symptoms do not imply voluntary actions, and may occur even when one stands still. They are non-verbal manifestations by definition, and thus hard to describe for the patients. Recent phenomenological developments have nonetheless brought these symptoms back to the forefront. However, compared to the exploration of agency disorders, experimental evidence for disorders of body self-perception is still scarce. The aim of the symposium is to bring together the work of four teams that have independently explored this question with distinct experimental psychology approaches. The sense of bodily self and the ability to see the world from one’s own first-person perspective relies on the integration of both interoceptive and exteroceptive information. Being ‘immersed in the world’, the impression of being in direct contact with the environment, relies on the ability to correctly attribute and integrate information from the outer world relative to oneself, and to synchronize oneself with the environment. It is precisely these abilities that are explored by studying the processing of interoceptive and multisensory information or time prediction, and the sensitivity to asynchronies. Lénie Torregrossa explores interoceptive signals in patients with schizophrenia by looking at their ability to accurately report heartbeats, and to precisely localize emotions in their body. Both abilities are affected in patients, and the results represent a unique insight in the alteration of how patients feel their own body. Anne Giersch explores time disorders and shows behavioral and EEG results suggesting that instead of reaching a sense of time continuity, patients with schizophrenia are abnormally sensitive to short asynchronies. She argues that such difficulties may affect the flow of sensory signals, and thus the bodily self. Neeltje van Haren explores body self-perception disorders using the rubber hand illusion, which is based on visuo-tactile stimulation. Patients report that the rubber hand feels like their own hand more than controls, reflecting the fragility of the patients’ body boundaries. Interestingly, agency disorders are explored in parallel, and the results allow for discussion of the relative roles of sensorimotor input vs. the cognitive body representation in sensitivity to the illusion. Roy Salomon induces a feeling of presence experimentally, and shows it affects the ability of first episode patients to distinguish between their own voice and the voice of another person. This deficit correlates with resting-state fMRI dysconnectivity in the cortical systems of bodily self-representations. Voice misattributions have been shown in people with auditory hallucinations, these results thus relate body ownership impairments with agency disorders. The presentations, taking different perspectives, provide complementary descriptions of body self-perception disorders and of their underlying mechanisms. The discussant (Steve Silverstein) will integrate these data on body self-perception disorders in schizophrenia and discuss potential mechanistic interpretations and therapeutic implications.",

      "title": "Family psychoeducation in the early stages of mood and psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "When combined with pharmacotherapy, family psychoeducation and skills training are key strategies for preventing, delaying or minimizing the severity of illness episodes in major psychiatric disorders1-3. High levels of expressed emotion – as indicated by critical comments, hostility and/or emotional overinvolvement from caregivers – are associated with high rates of recurrence in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. These familial attitudes can become more negative and fixed as the disorders progress4. Early on in the illness trajectory, there is a window of opportunity for prevention or mitigation of disability in young persons. During this interval, patients and parents are usually most open to the collaborative approach of psychoeducation, in which they examine their thinking and behavior in relation to one another. Family psychoeducational interventions, however, have never completely “made it out of the shop”. Few practitioners have been trained in these methods. When psychoeducation is offered at all, it is usually in the form of unstructured support groups or canned didactic lectures. Moreover, support groups have limited reach: in a 2017 survey of 2,395 patient and caregiver respondents from the Depressive and Bipolar Support Alliance, a US-based support organization, 87% of persons with bipolar disorder were taking medications but only 10% attended support groups5. When adolescents or young adults first experience symptoms of mood or psychotic disorders, both they and their families are understandably confused as to what is happening. Parents have basic questions about the diagnosis, the likely course of symptoms over time, and what treatments are likely to be successful. Unfortunately, many clinicians simply provide didactic information in rote fashion, instead of assisting the family and the patient in negotiating the complex challenges of a new illness. What psychoeducational strategies help engage families and patients at these stages of illness development? Consider an 18-year old male, Zak, who has had an acute manic episode requiring hospitalization. Zak's father is able to describe the prodromal symptoms prior to his admission (e.g., rapid speech, irritable mood), but believes that his son has schizophrenia. His mother thinks that he is depressed. Zak thinks that there is nothing wrong with him. A psychoeducational family clinician will start with the provision of factual material: the key symptoms of mania and how they are different from those of a psychotic episode or normal teenage behavior. The clinician will personalize this information by encouraging Zak to describe the development of his symptoms and parents to chime in with their observations. The patient is identified as the “expert in the illness”, because “you can educate us as to what you've gone through and what might help you recover”. When their position in the family is elevated in this way, young people are more able to cope with the well-intended but often intrusive or critical comments of their relatives. Moving a step further, the clinician will encourage the parents and offspring to explore the practical application of Zak's diagnosis: what might be the early warning signs of new manic or depressive episodes? A paper or online mood chart6, completed daily by Zak and his parents, will help the family to become familiar with his patterns of mood shifts. The parents’ attributions about the causes of these fluctuations (e.g., “He has a biologically-based mood disorder” versus “He's lazy”) will be addressed. The clinician will gently challenge parents as to the usefulness of certain beliefs, especially those that lead them to become harsher or expect an unrealistically high level of functioning in their offspring. In a similar vein, families need help locating and evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of treatment options. They may be confused about how to decide on the intensity (e.g., weekly individual therapy vs. partial hospitalization) or type of care (e.g., pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or support groups). The parents may not agree on the need for medications or, if they do, they may not agree on what type or dosage is needed. They may need guidance in advocating for the child within the school system. Siblings may be confused as to their role in helping their ill brother or sister (or, at minimum, how not to trigger symptoms further). A different set of questions may haunt young affected people during this period. These issues surround how the illness will impact their peer and school relationships or activities, or even how their identity has been changed by the illness. They may express considerable resentment toward their parents for seemingly overreacting to minor symptoms or for insisting on a regimented lifestyle. These issues can become intertwined with the young persons’ struggle for autonomy. Psychiatric treatment may come to symbolize the last bastion of their parents’ control over them, with the psychiatrist seen as an agent of the parents. A key component of psychoeducation is the relapse prevention plan. The patient and the parents make a list of early warning signs of episodes and past stressors – major or minor – that appear to have triggered those episodes (e.g., the start of a new school year). Then, clinicians coach the family to make a list of potential coping strategies (e.g., try to regulate sleep and wake times) and potential obstacles to their implementation (e.g., foregoing late-night parties). The plan is modified over time as more data are collected on warning signs, eliciting stressors and effective coping strategies. In later segments of psychoeducation, clinicians attempt to modify levels of expressed emotion by guiding families in effective communication and problem-solving. Clinicians elicit role-play interchanges between parents and offspring with practice of skills such as active listening, making requests for changes in each other's behaviors, and balancing positive and negative feedback. To reduce parent/offspring criticisms (e.g., “I resent the hours you keep”), clinicians can take several steps: a) reframe the criticism as coming out of positive intentions (e.g., “I am worried about you not getting enough sleep and getting ill again”); b) point out that the parent's manner of delivery is inadvertently alienating the offspring; and c) model for the parent how he/she might make a request for behavior changes (e.g., “I'd appreciate your helping me manage my own anxiety by keeping to a regular bedtime”). These exchanges can be followed by problem-solving exercises in which family members offer practical input about how to keep consistent nightly routines. Severe family conflict often grows out of parents’ disappointments over failed expectations of the child. Input from the offspring about what they can or cannot accomplish while still symptomatic is essential. The offspring can be coached to make decisions that will enhance their chances of recovery (e.g., avoiding enrolling themselves in too many courses; discontinuing use of cannabis or psychostimulants). Recovery can be framed as an objective that must be achieved by the family as a whole, not only by the patient. Randomized clinical trials indicate that, among youth in the early stages of bipolar disorder, a 12-session, 4-month protocol of family-focused therapy (psychoeducation, communication training and problem-solving) is associated with shorter depressive episodes, longer periods of wellness between episodes, and less suicidal ideation and behavior than briefer forms of education1, 7. The broader availability of psychoeducational therapy may do much to reduce the long-term personal, familial and societal burdens imposed by severe psychiatric disorders.",

The usual environmental and psychological factors that influence maturation are modified by the attitudes of other persons toward the disabled one and by his own attitudes toward his defects and the limitations which they impose upon him. During the first few formative years, the normal child develops increasing physical independence as his motility and equilibrium patterns mature, enabling him to erect himself against gravity and to locomote independently. This growing capability is paralleled by the ego development and the appreciation of body image concept. The development of speech is a major step in communication and greatly facilitates the child's contact with his environment. The alteration of these patterns of maturation by central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders may influence profoundly the individual's personality. This results from the anxiety",

      "title": "F34. AUDITORY SENSORY GATING IN YOUNG ADOLESCENTS WITH EARLY-ONSET PSYCHOSIS: A COMPARISON WITH ADHD",
      "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated impaired sensory gating in schizophrenia and this phenomenon has been proposed as a candidate biomarker for the disorder. Sensory gating is typically assessed during an auditory paired-click test commonly referred to as a P50 suppression paradigm. When two identical stimuli are presented, healthy subjects show a decrease in their neural response to the second stimulus, reflected in a decreased P50 amplitude, whereas schizophrenia patients on average show a much smaller decrease. So far, sensory gating has primarily been investigated in adult patients with schizophrenia, but gating disturbances have also been demonstrated in other illnesses, e.g. in schizotypal personality disorder, albeit less marked. Although the typical age of onset for schizophrenia is late adolescence to early adulthood, a sizable group of patients presents with psychotic symptoms during childhood or early adolescence. Manifestation of psychotic symptoms before the age of 18 is commonly referred to as early-onset psychosis (EOP). Various studies have reported a more severe course of illness and a poorer outcome in EOP compared to the adult-onset form of the disorder. In parallel, we expect more pronounced sensory gating deficits in EOP. Impaired sensory gating may not be specific to psychosis, but rather a shared disturbance of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) differ in many ways from those found in schizophrenia, there are common characteristics. Compared to schizophrenia, relatively few studies have investigated sensory gating in ADHD, and some report P50 gating deficits similar to those frequently found in patients with schizophrenia. We investigated P50 suppression in a large cohort of adolescents (12–17 years old) consisting of patients with either EOP (N=56) or ADHD (N=28) as well as age and gender matched healthy controls (N=72). In our paradigm two identical sounds (clicks) were presented separated by a 500ms interval. The amount of suppression was expressed as the ratio between the P50 amplitude of a subject’s response to the first click and his/her amplitude in response to the second click. The EOP patients scored significantly higher on PANSS (positive, negative, general, and total PANSS scores) compared to both ADHD patients and healthy controls. However, there were neither significant group differences in raw P50 amplitude, nor in the gating ratios between young adolescents with EOP, ADHD and healthy controls. This is the first study to investigate sensory gating in young adolescents with EOP. We found no P50 suppression deficits in these patients which, given the relatively large sample size in our study, cannot merely be ascribed to power issues. The results are in contrast with the majority of studies investigating sensory gating in schizophrenia and ADHD. However, the results are in agreement with earlier studies from our lab showing evidence of inconsistent P50 suppression deficits in two separate cohorts of adult, antipsychotic naïve, first-episode patients with schizophrenia. Based on our findings, P50 sensory gating cannot differentiate between young adolescents with EOP or ADHD, and deficient P50 suppression does not seem to be a valid biomarker for EOP.",

      "abstract": "As diagnosis criteria of personality disorders are developing, people are more aware of the effects of mental disorders. Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is one of the ten personality disorders that is classified by DSM-V, which has typical patterns of attention-seeking behaviours. HPD symptoms not only make individuals struggle to properly interact with their surrounding people, but also make them unable to build or maintain long-term relation-ships, which can further lead to mental distresses. Serious consequences of HPD people’s unpredictable emotions are also witnessed, such as embarrass-ing or harming others, which disturb normal social orders. This article anal-yses the potential causes, impacts and treatments of HPD based on previous studies on cluster B personality disorders. According to the results, various triggers of HPD include the experiences of being ignored or mildly annoyed by parents and anxious-preoccupied attachment styles, and HPD can lead to serious cooccurring mental disorders including other personality disorders, depression, and also various cognitive issues related to mental disorders. In addition, questionnaires have been developed to diagnose HPD, and effec-tive treatments methods such as functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP) and cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) are used to reduce HPD symptoms.",

      "abstract": "FOXP1 syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with complex clinical presentations including global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual disability, speech and language impairment, autism traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a range of behavioral challenges. To date, much of the literature focuses on childhood symptoms and little is known about the FOXP1 syndrome phenotype in adolescence or adulthood. A series of caregiver interviews and standardized questionnaires assessed psychiatric and behavioral features of 20 adolescents and adults with FOXP1 syndrome. Clinical interviews captured change in various psychiatric manifestations over time. Medication, social, educational, and vocational history was collected, and visual analog scales measured top caregiver concerns during childhood and adolescence/adulthood. Anxiety and externalizing behaviors were common in this cohort and psychiatric features, such as psychosis or bipolar symptoms, were present in two participants. There was no reported regression or loss of skills, early in development or during adolescence/adulthood. Medication use was common particularly for features of ADHD, although multiple trials were required for some individuals to achieve benefit. Standardized assessments accurately picked up on externalizing symptoms and were less sensitive to internalizing symptoms. Educational setting varied up until late elementary school and gradually shifted to special education. Cognitive and developmental concerns were reported as primary during childhood and independence/safety and housing concerns became top concerns by adolescence/adulthood. Caregivers reported continued development in adaptive skills even into adulthood. Taken together, results are reassuring, with many families reporting their adolescent and adult children continued to gain skills over time, particularly related to increased independence in communication and personal care. There were no reports of developmental regression, neuropsychiatric decompensation or catatonia.",

There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive; predominantly hyperactive-impulsive; and combined type. For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. At the age of 25, half will still have symptoms which continue to cause significant impairment. ADHD is associated with an increased rate of other disorders: mood disorders; anxiety; other behavioural disorders; autism spectrum disorders; tic disorders; specific learning difficulties; developmental co-ordination disorder and sleep disorders.

Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

      "title": "TWO CASES OF DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS DEVELOPING AFTER SEVERE MENTAL EMOTION AND SHOCK",
      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

Bekannt ist, dass selbstverletzendes Verhalten mit verschiedenen psychischen Störungen assoziiert ist; bislang fehlt es an einer systematischen Aufarbeitung. Methoden: Es wurde eine systematische Literaturrecherche durchgeführt. 21 der gesichteten 1298 Studien erfüllten die vorgegebenen Auswahlkriterien. Ergebnisse: Bei Jugendlichen und Erwachsenen mit selbstverletzendem Verhalten fanden sich am häufigsten affektive und Persönlichkeitsstörungen; in der Klasse der Charakterstörungen dominiert die Borderline-Störung. Dahinter folgten Angst- und Substanzmissbrauchs-/Abhängigkeitsstörungen. Speziell bei Jugendlichen zeigten sich häufig externalisierende Störungen, während im Erwachsenenalter verstärkt Essstörungen komorbid vorlagen. Schlussfolgerungen: Selbstverletzendes Verhalten tritt in der Adoleszenz häufiger im Rahmen einer psychischen Störung auf als im Erwachsenenalter. Unabhängig von der Alterskohorte sind depressive Erkrankungen und die Borderline-Persönlichkeitsstörung eng mit Selbstverletzungen assoziiert. Unklar ist, inwiefern das Auftreten von selbstverletzendem Verhalten mit einer bestimmten Störung durch die Komorbidität mit dem Borderline-Syndrom erklärt werden kann.",

      "title": "PSYCHIC TRAUMA IN PATHOGENESIS OF EXOPHTHALMIC GOITER*",
      "abstract": "The taking of a careful history in patients with exophthalmic goiter commonly yields three important facts: (1) Information to the effect that one or more blood relatives is or had been suffering with \"nervousness,\" exophthalmic goiter, or diabetes mellitus; (2) the patient has been of more or less \"nervous\" temperament, characterized by irritability, impatience, fractiousness, and emotionalism, usually since childhood; (3) the onset of the symptoms of the disease followed soon after the occurrence of a psychic trauma. From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder is a severe, chronic, and disabling illness that adversely impacts the child's psychosocial development including family, social, and academic functioning. Prevalence of bipolar disorder is about 1% in adolescents. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and younger adolescents is a challenge, as symptoms may differ from those typically observed in late adolescence and adulthood. One main area of debate centers around the core mood symptom of pediatric mania. The presence of classic cardinal symptoms of euphoria and/or grandiosity characterized by distinctive developmental expressions is emphasized by one view, while another view stresses the distinctly assaultive and persistent irritability of pediatric mania. The non-episodic, continuous, rapid cycling pattern and the high rate of mixed mania pose additional diagnostic challenge, as clinicians may not be able to rely on the typical presence of mood swings to make the diagnosis. Frequent occurrence of comorbid disorders exhibiting symptom overlap with pediatric mania, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may further complicate the diagnosis. Appreciation of current evidence combined with exercise of good clinical judgment may help clinicians optimally diagnose a substantial number of psychiatrically referred youths who present with a complex and severe symptomatology suggestive of bipolar disorder.",

The descriptor \"psychoeducation\" can be misleading: family psychoeducation includes cognitive, behavioral, and supportive therapeutic elements, often utilizes a consultative framework, and shares characteristics with some models of family therapy. If family members confronted by negative symptoms in a loved one have little formal knowledge of the illness, they are likely to respond with increased involvement, emotional intensity, criticism, or even hostility. The available evidence across several severe and chronic illnesses indicates that ongoing access to social contact and support prevents the deterioration of conditions and improves their course. The cumulative record of efficacy for family intervention, variously termed \"family psychoeducation,\" \"family behavioral management,\" or \"family work\" is remarkable. Once the family is engaged and while the patient is being stabilized, the family is invited to a workshop conducted by the clinicians who will lead the multifamily group.",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "abstract": "The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is one of the main causes of neurodegenerative dementias in adults. Patients present with an early decline in social conduct, impaired regulation of interpersonal conduct, apathy, emotional blunting, and general loss of insight. However, symptoms are highly variable among patients, leading to misdiagnosis or diagnosis delay in particular when psychiatric symptoms are prominent at the onset of the disease. More specifically, personality disorders have been described as either a risk factor for misdiagnosis or as part of the bvFTD phenotype.\r\n\r\nHere we report the case of a 52-year-old woman, born from consanguineous parents and with a family history of early-onset dementia, who was first diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Nonetheless, atypical symptoms such as apathy, disinhibition, hyperorality, depressive symptoms and psychotic manifestations were described.The clinical exam revealed a frontal lobe dysfunction, along with severe cognitive impairment as revealed by the neuropsychological assessment (alteration of facial emotion recognition and theory of mind, with a relative sparing of executive and instrumental functions). Brain imaging revealed atrophy of frontal lobes and right hemisphere, and a hypometabolism of the right frontotemporal lobe.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the clinical presentation and her family history, screening for hereditary diseases was performed, revealing a heterozygous mutation of PGRN gene. The diagnosis of bvFTD with progranulin mutation was finally made. This case highlights for the first time a diagnosis of bvFTD associated with a progranulin mutation and a history of late-labeled histrionic personality disorder. It emphasizes the need to actively seek frontal symptoms and consider PGRN mutation in late-labelled patients with personality disorders with a family history of neurodegenerative disorders.",

Jellemzően csak egy-két tünet utal hangulatzavarra, melyek sokszor testi betegség, vagy kognitív deficit (pszeudodemencia) formájában vehetők észre, ezáltal a páciens és a háziorvos is félreértelmezheti a depresszióra utaló jeleket. Mindezek mellett a mentális betegségekhez kapcsolódó stigmatizáció is szerepet játszhat idősek körében abban, hogy nem jelentik a hangulatzavarral kapcsolatos tüneteiket.&#x0D; Az egészségügyi ellátó intézmények közül az alapellátásban dolgozóknak van a legnagyobb hozzáférése a depresszióban szenvedő idős személyekhez, ezért célszerű őket egyebek mellett a hangulatzavar időskorra vonatkozó sajátosságairól tájékoztatni, valamint szűrésére ösztönözni, hiszen kezeletlensége számos kockázatot von maga után.",

The provisional diagnosis \"acute psychosis\" involves psychotic conditions with acute onset, psychotic conditions with unknown course and acute behavioural disorders with unknown subjective experiences. Because this provisional diagnosis is not a proper category, dimensional assessment of psychopathology including delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, mood/affect, catatonia and disorder of consciousness is required to start specific treatment. As \"acute psychosis\" is nosologically ill defined in the dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorder, traditional types such as bouffée délirante, cycloid psychoses and reactive psychosis are useful in practice as frames of reference.

      "title": "Is it appropriate to treat people at high‐risk of psychosis before first onset ‐ Yes",
      "abstract": "Youth mental health expert Alison Yung says safe treatments should be offered Schizophrenia carries a great personal and economic burden. It begins with a non-psychotic prodromal phase before the onset of characteristic positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. This prodromal phase is therefore a potential target for early intervention. Criteria have been developed to identify the prodromal phase.1 Essentially, they include transient or subthreshold psychotic symptoms and/or a genetic risk for schizophrenia combined with a significant decrease in functioning. Exact age criteria vary across different settings, but tend to be age between 14 and 30 years, the age at highest risk of psychosis onset. These “ultra-high risk” (UHR) criteria are associated with high rates of onset of disorder, of 36% at 3 years after clinical presentation.2 About 73% of people “transitioning” have a schizophrenic psychosis, so individuals meeting UHR criteria are considered to be at high risk of schizophrenia. Clinical services that treat individuals at ultra-high risk of psychosis who are symptomatic and help-seeking are now available almost worldwide. They receive referrals from general practitioners, counsellors, and other services that manage young people. Presenting problems include a range of psychiatric symptoms and problems with living, and there are high rates of non-psychotic mental disorders. Treatment involves managing individuals’ current needs; monitoring for signs of deterioration and for evidence of the onset of psychosis; and attempting to prevent the onset of psychotic disorder. Case management involves providing practical help with finances, accommodation, education and other issues. Other treatment offered includes supportive therapy, stress management, cognitive therapy (CT), family-based treatment and pharmacological management of non-psychotic disorders. Monitoring an individual's mental state and detecting psychosis early allows prompt treatment and minimisation of the duration of untreated psychosis, which, if prolonged, is harmful to both patients and their families and is known to be associated with a poor outcome. Additionally, if a person becomes psychotic, treatment for the first episode of psychosis can begin with an existing treating team. Trials of treatment with low-dose antipsychotics, CT and fish oil have been conducted and have shown reductions in transition rates. A recent review of five trials found a significant effect of specific treatment (such as supportive counselling), compared with control treatment, in reducing the transition rate at 12, 24 and 36 months although antipsychotics were not proven in any trial to confer additional benefit.3 However, this review did not include two recently published articles that found no difference between treatment and control groups.1,4 All trials found that the interventions tested were effective at reducing symptoms and improving functioning among individuals at ultra-high risk of psychosis. Importantly, since it seems that antipsychotics are no more effective than more benign treatments, the current recommendation is to use these safer options. This approach has the additional advantage that these interventions are likely to be effective across a range of different psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Even if an individual meeting UHR criteria is not truly at risk of psychotic disorder, the therapy will still be of benefit. Antipsychotics are not recommended for individuals at ultra-high risk.1,4 Evidence is also emerging that clinical services are at least likely to be cost-effective. They may even be associated with a reduction in health costs5 through a reduction in the proportion of people developing schizophrenia and a decrease in the duration of untreated psychosis. Savings are made through reductions in direct service contacts and in unemployment. Telling individuals that they are at risk of psychotic disorder could lead to anxiety and self-stigmatisation. This may be offset by the help provided. The knowledge that monitoring of mental state will detect signs of deterioration should they occur, and the realisation that others have similar experiences, can be reassuring. Communication of risk can be seen as a relief. It is important to note that treatment within a service for individuals at ultra-high risk and discussion of risk is different from giving a formal diagnostic label that implies a person has a valid and distinct diagnostic entity with an invariable outcome. Individuals at ultra-high risk of psychosis presenting to services are distressed and are seeking help. Their management within specialised services enables the provision of practical help, treatment of current needs, assessment of mental state and early detection of onset of psychotic disorder. In some cases, psychosis may even be prevented. Currently recommended treatments such as supportive therapy, CT and fish oil are also likely to be of benefit for other psychiatric disorders. Rather than waiting to see if schizophrenia develops, these benign interventions at this stage are justified. Commissioned; not externally peer reviewed. No relevant disclosures.",

Schizophrenia usually occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood but is generally preceded by a prodromal phase or by a high risk mental state which corresponds to the onset of the disease. Early detection of symptoms and rapid specialized intervention begin at this stage. Medical intervention at this stage aims to influence the course of the disease and to limit the transition to a first-episode psychosis (FEP). Patients with FEP will require initiation of antipsychotic treatment. A long delay before antipsychotic treatment initiation will negatively impact the short and long term outcomes: more severe symptoms, worse treatment response and less global functioning. Early detection of schizophrenia involves general practitioners who will be firstly solicited by patients and their families. Patient should then be addressed without any delay to specialized psychiatric teams.",

(1) For its part, SDC related to major depressive disorder (MDD) is a growing phenomenon even though its clinical characteristics are easy to hide or are less evident in the social sphere (2,3); in these cases, said association may have more negative effects on people’s lives than the disorder itself. (4,5) Consequently, the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) was designed to quantify the relationship between SDC and MDD (SDC-MDD). This is a Likert scale consisting of two subscales with nine items each. The first addresses the issue of attitude towards people who meet criteria for MDD, i.e. perceived stigma, and the second, the anticipated attitude for MDD, i.e. personal stigma or self-stigma. (6)",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with upheavals in personal relationships, through alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-reported because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see Definition and comparability).",

      "abstract": "Depression and moral masochism are inseparable, and originate in a particular climate of lived experience in which one or both parents suffer from a masochistic-depressive disposition. Developmentally, there has been a deficit in the child's experience of shared pleasure, and of being a source of enjoyment to the parent. Instead, the child experiences himself or herself as a source of pain and feels responsible for the parent's dysphoric, anhedonic state. This is not simply a fantasy construction of the child, as parental reproachfulness is characteristically encountered. The child makes reparative efforts, but they generally do not succeed. Central psychological capacities are compromised under these conditions, particularly a sense of personal efficacy and of natural entitlement. The evolution of initiative, autonomy, and individuation are also significantly affected. The aggression, both conscious and unconscious, which is generated by these early conditions creates intrapsychic conflict which further inhibits the development of these essential psychological functions. Some therapeutic recommendations are proposed based on these considerations.",

      "abstract": "Introduction ADHD is a diagnosis almost always made in childhood or adolescence and oftent difficult to make it new in adults because it is not thought of in the differential diagnosis process and for the lack of experience from adult devices. - ADHD in adults is characterized by symptoms of executive dysfunction, inattention, emotional dysregulation. The symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity tend to be less evident. Objectives - Frequently, the adult patient with ADHD comes to the consultation with a secondary symptom and the primary pathology is hidden and often not evident at first glance. Methods - A 20-year-old woman, university student, with no relevant medical or psychiatric history, without toxic habits, who attended her first consultation referred by her primary care physician for long-standing insomnia, restless legs and anxiety. - The patient’s underlying complaint and her bigger concern is her poor academic performance. It is striking that she has just started her third year at the university, the first year she did not pass any subjects, the second year she changed majors and only passed two, now she is repeating the course. - The examination did not reveal overt affective symptoms, nor psychotic symptoms or other notable psychopathology. The patient’s speech tended towards superficiality, inconcretion, it was salty, it was difficult for her to express herself, even suggesting a certain intellectual disability. - In the first consultation sleep study is requested. And referral to clinical psychology consultation for psychometric study. Results - She is administered Clinical interview and WAIS IV (Adult Intelligence Scale), Trail Making Test, d2 and Stroop, Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (inattention items). - The WAIS-IV demonstrated global cognitive abilities within normality, although with significantly lower scores in the IMT and IVP indices which involve the functions of attention, concentration, mental control and short-term visual memory). Trail Making Test, d2, Stroop and Diagnostic Interview of ADHD in adults (inattention items) yielded profile results highly suggestive of Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity. - The insomnia subsided with a regimen of 7.5 mg of mirtazapine per day. Subsequently, after starting treatment with low-dose methylphenidate (20 mg/day), the patient improved very significantly, both academic performance and social functioning and mood, self-esteem and subjective well-being. Conclusions - We must always include ADHD in the differential diagnosis of a young adult patient when faced with a wide variety of consultation symptoms, especially if they report some type of deterioration or dysfunction in their social, family or academic life. - An adequate clinical evaluation supported, if possible, by psychometric tests is essential to reach the diagnosis, which allows establishing an effective treatment that modifies the patient’s overall prognosis.

      "title": "Dissociative Identity Disorder and Its Relationship with Other Diagnoses",
      "abstract": "Dissociative identity disorder is the most complex, severe, and chronic condition within the category of dissociative disorders. The core issue in dissociative identity disorder involves significant divisions and discontinuities in an individual's memory, behavior, emotions, consciousness, and identity, which typically function as a cohesive whole. These dissociative experiences lead to impairments in various psychological functions and are often accompanied by other psychological disorders. Compared to other mental health conditions, environmental factors play a more prominent role in the development of dissociative identity disorder. This is primarily because the etiology of dissociative disorders is closely linked to repeated, systematic, and traumatic experiences, particularly during childhood. Historically, dissociative identity disorder has been diagnosed late, and its association with trauma has often been overlooked. The presence of alter identities and the challenges in recognizing dissociative identity disorder have contributed to this oversight, resulting in a delay in exploring the connections between dissociative identity disorder and other diagnoses. This study aims to investigate the history, diagnostic criteria, treatment approaches, and dissociative aspects of dissociative identity disorder, as well as its relationships with other mental health disorders. Notably, dissociative identity disorder has strong associations with conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, somatization, eating disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The interplay between these diagnoses and dissociative identity disorder is examined through the lens of shared symptoms, comorbidity, etiology, and epidemiology. The delayed recognition of the diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for dissociative identity disorder and the consequent neglect of its relationship with other disorders in the literature underscore the significance of this study. By highlighting these connections, we can enhance our understanding and improve the treatment of individuals affected by dissociative identity disorder and its comorbid conditions.",

      "abstract": "Although psychosis is not one of the most commonly recognized psychiatric comorbidities of Eating Disorders (ED), there is an increasing empirical evidence of associations between these psychopathological conditions. Indeed, ED as well as early manifestations of schizophrenic psychosis emerge during developmental years and might present some affinities in the presentation at onset. For example, adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) may report psychotic-like eating-related symptoms such as delusional-like body image distortions and/or \"anorexic voice\". Conversely, early expressions of schizophrenia spectrum vulnerability might involve altered bodily experiences, delusional ideation on food and eating as well as pseudo-anorectic behaviors. From a phenomenological perspective, this partial symptomatic overlap may lie on common features of disturbed corporeality in terms of disembodiment, although these alterations of embodiment are presumably rooted in distinct pathogenetic pathways (e.g., primary childhood ontogenetic pathway in schizophrenia vs. a secondary adolescent ontogenetic pathway in AN). A clinical-phenomenological attitude could be important not only to better discern potential overlaps and affinities between the two conditions, but also to better conceptualize and treat those background alterations of the embodied self. In particular, a phenomenological exploration of the experiential side of eating-related behaviors could be a decisive step to support early differential diagnosis and treatment appropriateness.",

The said section covers all conditions and problems that are a focus of clinical attention or that may otherwise affect the diagnosis, course, prognosis, or treatment of a patient's mental disorder. While cults are usually led by charismatic leaders, who offer acceptance and guidance to troubled followers, cult followers are strongly controlled and forced to dissolve commitment to family and others to serve the cult leader's directives and personal needs. On the other hand, there were many cult leaders, who have been convicted of violent or non-violent crimes, as a commander or committer, before, during or after their period as a cult leader. While many bio-psycho-social factors involve in the grouping and formation of sects or cults, numerous dynamics, too, may prepare the group’s state of mind for perpetrating crime. Among a number of conceivable historical, cultural, or radical causes, while psychopathy, at all times, have had a firm position in forensic psychiatry, narcissism, whether as a primary trait or as a misleadingly stirred quality, have been generally over looked. Interrelationship between narcissism and psychopathy, from one hand, and the scarce set of circumstances, on the other hand, may create a situation, full of mix-ups, which can be continued melancholically and hazardously.

      "abstract": "Acute stress disorder is a psychiatric diagnosis that may occur in patients within four weeks of a traumatic event. Features include anxiety, intense fear or helplessness, dissociative symptoms, reexperiencing the event, and avoidance behaviors. Persons with this disorder are at increased risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder. Other risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder include current or family history of anxiety or mood disorders, a history of sexual or physical abuse, lower cognitive ability, engaging in excessive safety behaviors, and greater symptom severity one to two weeks after the trauma. Common reactions to trauma include physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. Persistent psychological distress that is severe enough to interfere with psychological or social functioning may warrant further evaluation and intervention. Patients experiencing acute stress disorder may benefit from psychological first aid, which includes ensuring the patient's safety; providing information about the event, stress reactions, and how to cope; offering practical assistance; and helping the patient to connect with social support and other services. Cognitive behavior therapy is effective in reducing symptoms and decreasing the future incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder. Critical Incident Stress Debriefing aims to mitigate emotional distress through sharing emotions about the traumatic event, providing education and tips on coping, and attempting to normalize reactions to trauma. However, this method may actually impede natural recovery by overwhelming victims. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of drugs in the treatment of acute stress disorder. Short-term pharmacologic intervention may be beneficial in relieving specific associated symptoms, such as pain, insomnia, and depression.",

People with schizophrenia misinterpret social information and it is suggested that this difficulty may result from visual processing deficits. As faces are one of the most important sources of social information it is hypothesized that people suffering from the disorder have impairments in the visual face processing system. It is unclear which mechanism of the face processing system is impaired but two types of deficits are most often proposed: a deficit in face perception in general (i.e., processing of facial features as such) and a deficit in facial emotion processing (i.e., recognition of emotional facial expressions). Due to the contradictory evidence from behavioural, electrophysiological as well as neuroimaging studies offering support for the involvement of one or the other deficit in schizophrenia it is early to make any conclusive statements as to the nature and level of impairment. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the key mechanism and abnormalities underlying social dysfunction in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "A successful social interaction depends on the social cognitive traits that are defined as the ability to understand other people's feelings and what goes through their minds. Inability to correctly assess the motivation of other's feelings and behaviors, and anger control disorders are among the underlying causes of violent behaviors that have been escalating in our day. On the other hand, there is a negative relationship between empathy and criminal behavior. In this context, the role of neurodevelopmental disorders in the development of such behaviors have been discussed. It has been reported that neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (OSD), specific learning disabilities, and intellectual disability may have negative effects on empathy development. Children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders, especially ADHD, are experiencing developmental difficulties in cognitive, emotional, academic, and social areas. However, in the research, inconsistent findings related to difficulties in interpreting social cues and empathy skills in ADHD have been found, and it has been suggested that this may be related to comorbid psychopathologies. It has been determined that cognitive impairment is deteriorated in OSD due to social cognitive problems. In this article, it is aimed to review the literature on development of empathy in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially ADHD. Key words such as 'empathy', 'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'autism', 'learning disabilities' were entered in this direction and Medline, PSYCInfo and Turkish Medical Journal were scanned from 1990.",

It has been often wrongly diagnosed as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, impulse control disorder, or borderline personality disorder among others. We are presenting one such case. Ms. M, a nineteen year old college going girl was brought for consultation by her mother for repeated attacks of amnesia and poor impulse control related symptoms like irritability, destructive behaviour and self harm. On further enquiry, the patient gave a history of being accused of lying and being hypocritical since she was in the sixth grade; having no memory of how she landed up in unexpected places (a nearby zoo/friend's place); having a sense of being estranged, hearing voices in her head of her mother talking with other people. Her mother gave a history of being able to see 3 different states in her daughter- a nineteen year old intelligent college student; a trusting state in which she speaks in a childish voice and having high risk behaviour (like going off with strangers, taking drinks mixed with intoxicants, not recognizing treating doctors); and an aggressive state in which she is easily irritable, paces about and attempts to harm her mother or herself. She (patient) herself is unaware of these episodes and states. On admission, organicity was ruled out by appropriate tests. She was put on a mood stabilizer and anti depressive agents for symptomatic control. Safety and security was established. The patient narrated her abuse (during adolescence) in one of the other dissociative states. This could have been misdiagnosed as psychosis, intermittent explosive disorder, depressive disorder, or borderline personality disorder. The keen observation by the mother (who herself had possession syndrome and depression earlier in life) helped in the diagnosis. A treating clinician must be aware and be on the lookout for dissociative states and be prepared for therapeutic work with such patients.",

It is unclear, though, if life stress is related to particular classes or specific symptoms in depression. The association between severe life events and depressive symptoms was tested in 59 individuals diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria with endogenous primary nonpsychotic major depression. As predicted, life stress was associated principally with cognitive-affective symptoms, not somatic symptoms. There also was a consistent association across different assessment methods between severe events and suicidal ideation. Finally, associations held specifically for severe events occurring before onset, not for severe events occurring after onset. Symptom variation in major depression is related specifically to severe stressors before onset and includes primarily cognitive-affective types of symptoms. There is an especially pronounced association of prior severe stress with suicidal ideation. The implications of stress-symptom associations are addressed for enlarging understanding of symptom heterogeneity and subtype distinctions in major depression.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan).

      "title": "Caring for the patient with acute psychosis",
      "abstract": "FigureIn this article, we discuss how to recognize the event sequence that frequently takes place during a psychotic episode, measures to take when a patient with psychosis experiences anxiety, strategies to help patients with psychosis establish and maintain control of their behavior, how to monitor physical health in the patient with schizophrenia, effective communication techniques when a patient exhibits thought disturbances, and appropriate interventions to use when a patient expresses delusions or has hallucinations. What's schizophrenia? Schizophrenic spectrum is a group of psychotic reactions in which the patient experiences loose association of thoughts, dulled or blunted affect, anhedonia, ambivalence, and impaired social relationships. Schizophrenia is characterized by ideas of reference, delusions, and hallucinations (see Common symptoms of schizophrenia). Many causative factors have been suggested for this psychiatric disorder, including cortical atrophy, life stress, faulty family interactions, and low socioeconomic status. But prevailing notions about schizophrenia's etiology point to hereditary contributions of various genes, which predispose a person to an increased number of and sensitivity to dopamine-regulated neurons. In the active phase of schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms are prominent. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: delusions hallucinations disorganized speech grossly disorganized behavior negative symptoms such as apathy level of everyday functioning in work and self-care markedly below expectation continuous disturbance of premorbid or acute symptoms lasting 6 months or more schizoaffective, depressive, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features ruled out the disturbance isn't attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance or another medical condition. Table: Common symptoms of schizophreniaAntipsychotic medications remain the mainstay of treatment for psychotic disorders. Atypical antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole, olanzapine, and ziprasidone, have become the first line of therapy. These medications have a more favorable adverse reaction profile and they address both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Because schizophrenia is a chronic illness, patients require long-term integrated treatment. For the majority of patients, the most effective treatment is a combination of antipsychotic medication and psychotherapy. Understanding the breakdown There are four stages of a schizophrenic breakdown. During the first stage, patients experience a kind of euphoria with high energy. They may feel quite good temporarily as if they're on a mission or quest and their life has been given some greater meaning. This phase usually lasts a few days during which the patient doesn't get much sleep, calls friends and family at all hours of the day and night, and may be difficult to live with. The second stage includes what are termed ideas of reference—everything refers to the patient and there isn't anything that doesn't have special and deep meaning. There's a subtle shift between the euphoric sense of purpose and the patient's belief that everything that's happening has some personal significance. Words spoken on TV are specific messages to the patient, not general advertising. Little glances and conversations between people on the street aren't to each other, but are secret codes to the patient. The third stage is associated with what's known as the destructuring of perception. Events are either super strong or too weak for the patient to perceive, and there's a breakdown in the sensory processing apparatus. Have you ever seen the world through a kaleidoscope? People and places that were once predictable and familiar become disorienting and unfamiliar; the world is on a tilt. This is what happens to the patient experiencing psychosis. In the fourth and final stage, patients aren't able to inhibit extraneous or irrelevant stimuli—everything comes flooding in on them. This is no longer a euphoric state, but a very frightening one. At this point in their breakdown, patients often exhibit full-blown delusions and hallucinations. Generally, patients who experience such a break or exacerbation of illness are hospitalized in a community mental health center for a short stay, usually averaging 5 to 7 days. Outpatient treatment is also recommended. During this hospital stay, psychotropic medications are administered and schizophrenia will usually be brought under control within 2 to 4 weeks. Measures will be taken to reduce the patient's anxiety and care for the patient's physical needs until he or she is well enough to assume these responsibilities. A therapeutic, interpersonal relationship between nurse and patient helps the patient tolerate symptoms when acutely ill. The relationship also serves as a basis for further interaction as the patient gets better. Reducing anxiety Reducing the patient's anxiety is one of the most important initial measures you can take. The patient having an acute psychotic episode is intensely frightened. Fear is the prevailing problem in the initial phase of treatment; the more intense the fear, the more intense the psychotic symptoms. You can assume that the more the patient is talking through delusions, the more intense the hallucinations, the more frightened and anxious he or she is. The best approach to a patient whose psychosis appears to be increasing is to reduce his or her anxiety. You can do this by bringing the patient back to your reality. You might say, “I think I'm making you more anxious” or “Talking about this seems to make you more anxious.” For example, if a patient says, “I'm Jesus Christ, I'm God”—a grandiose delusion—you shouldn't respond by interpreting that the delusion is a response to the patient's insecurity. Rather, you want to respond to the process: the patient is getting more anxious, which is fueling the psychosis. You might say, “I think right now you're getting more anxious. Why don't we stop this discussion and sit here quietly for a minute” as opposed to “It sounds like what you're saying or feeling is...” There are times when sitting with the patient silently is the best response. You aren't overstimulating the patient, but you're giving him or her a sense of security—the patient isn't alone and he or she can rely on your reality for a while. To review, techniques that can help reduce anxiety include sharing your reality, responding to the process rather than interpreting, and staying with the patient quietly. Helping patients gain control In addition to reducing anxiety, you'll want to help patients establish and maintain control of their behavior. If you're working with a newly admitted patient experiencing psychosis, you need some capacity to relate to that individual and these skills must be learned. You must learn to speak to the patient's concern without hemming him or her in and without pressuring too much, yet you have to set firm limits. The symptoms of psychosis usually wax and wane; that is, if the patient is having auditory hallucinations or ideas of reference, the intensity of those symptoms—and the patient's capacity to distance him- or herself from them, control them, or resist them—probably varies throughout the day and day to day. So a patient who can't help him- or herself at one point during the hospital stay may be able to at another time, particularly if you encourage him or her to do so. This vacillation in self-control means that extremes are to be avoided. To treat patients with psychosis as if they have no capacity to control themselves is an error. To treat them as if everything is under their control is also an error, but for you to exhort them to manage whatever degree of control they can maintain is quite a reasonable expectation. You must remember that the patient with psychosis is responding to an internal state of mind over which you have little or no control. In fact, the patient is experiencing things that the observer isn't experiencing. You might say, “We know you may be terribly frightened, but we want you to know that you're safe here. These fears are symptoms of your illness, and we're going to protect you. We aren't going to let you get out of control if that should be a concern to you. And we would like you to warn us if you're concerned about getting out of control.” When you make that sort of unilateral statement, the patient is often comforted. If patients sense, in the midst of their terror, which is often inexpressible, that you understand to some degree what they're experiencing, they're often reassured. If patients fear that they may lose control of their impulses—usually violent impulses—they may be relieved to know that you aren't frightened that they have those concerns, and there are sufficient personnel that if they act out their impulses, you'll assist them to regain control. Most patients with psychosis, even though they may seem out of touch with reality, have excellent memories for what goes on during an acute episode. They remember what you do for them; what you don't do for them; and whatever you may do to them, which they may interpret negatively. Although they may be mute and unresponsive, patients with psychosis remember what's said. Keep this in mind when you work with these patients. In review, to help patients establish and maintain control, you should speak to patients' concerns, set firm limits, encourage patients to control themselves as much as they're able, and ensure them of their safety. Monitoring physical health Monitoring the physical health of patients with psychosis is also necessary. You must make sure that patients are having their daily needs met—eating, toileting, and resting sufficiently. Patients may ignore some of these functions during a psychotic episode. Be alert to signs of physical illness, such as lassitude or lethargy. Not all of the patient's physical symptoms may be manifestations of the psychiatric problem. You should actively intervene when the patient is behaving in ways detrimental to his or her health. Although an intervention principle is to allow the patient to control as much of his or her life as possible, there are instances when a psychiatric disorder can seriously interfere with the patient's well-being. An instance might be when a patient is unable to voluntarily decide to rest for the sake of his or her own health. Because of the patient's ambivalence, he or she might walk into the room in preparation for taking a nap, then walk back out, walk in, and walk back out. You have the difficult challenge of deciding at which point you need to take responsibility for the patient's well-being, with the ultimate goal of gradually transferring that control back to the patient as he or she achieves some level of readiness. In this instance, it would be appropriate for you to take the patient gently, but firmly by the arm and walk with him or her to the room. After you're there, you would assist the patient to sit on the bed and then lie down. You might say, “Now you'll rest. I'll stay with you while you rest or I'll check back with you to make sure you're resting. But now you'll rest.” To review, monitoring the patient's physical health includes meeting basic needs, attending to urgent health concerns, recognizing signs of illness, and preparing for the patient's indecision related to matters affecting his or her physical well-being. Communicating effectively The ability to communicate effectively is important when caring for patients who are experiencing an acute psychotic episode. It's impossible to provide a nurse with a script of therapeutic words, phrases, or sentences; instead, it's preferable for you to use your own personal style to operationalize a number of therapeutic principles (see Five therapeutic principles). If you're extroverted and sociable, then use it to greatest effect without overstimulating the patient. If you're introverted and soft-spoken, then use silence to allow the patient to reveal his or her feelings. Consider these strategies to communicate effectively (see Suggestions for communication). Listen for themes. When interviewing a patient with psychosis, it's often difficult to understand his or her story. If the patient is talking but is difficult to follow, you can listen for themes. Try to understand the most important theme in the patient's conversation. For example, the patient might be repetitively speaking about “decapitated babies, bloody knives, zombies, and empty graves.” Rather than asking questions about these things, it's better to simply ask the patient, “Are you feeling frightened?” Often, a patient who's rambling will respond that he or she is feeling frightened. Speak simply and concretely. One of the most important things to keep in mind when caring for a patient with psychosis is to speak simply and concretely so that the patient is able to follow. A long paragraph with many abstract ideas will be difficult for the patient to understand and respond to because it's too much stimulation. Accompany simple language with simple gestures. Rather than orienting the patient to his or her room using complex instructions about the call bell, TV remote device, or bed controls, you might say simply, “Come and sit” while gesturing with an open hand and an inviting facial expression. Anticipate the patient's experience. Sensitive communication is particularly helpful when a patient experiences thought blocking (the patient has many thoughts but can't choose one to say), expresses a delusion, or appears to be having hallucinations. When a patient is having tremendous difficulty with thought blocking, letting him or her know that you understand what's happening is often a relief. The patient who can't complete a sentence is very embarrassed and feels that something strange is happening to him or her that no one can understand. So it's immensely helpful for the patient to know that you can anticipate what he or she is experiencing, even if just a little bit. If the patient is experiencing delusions, one of the key principles of effective communication is letting him or her know when you don't understand. Communication can proceed most effectively if you're clear on what has been understood and what hasn't. It's important that you don't disagree with the patient's delusion; don't attempt to rationalize or argue with him or her. What you can say is, “I don't share that fear, but I understand that's the way you see things now.” In that way, you provide some consensual validation of the patient's reality without taking a punitive or disrespectful attitude toward his or her experience. If the patient is experiencing hallucinations, to intervene constructively you need to remember, first and foremost, that hallucinations, although not real for you, are experienced as very real for the patient. In most cases, hallucinations are threatening and ominous. It's useful for you to reassure the patient who's hallucinating. Any areas in which you have some control over protecting the patient should be pointed out. You might say, “I won't let anyone hurt you. I will protect you. I will stay with you.” You can share your perception of reality by saying, “I don't see, smell, or hear what you're experiencing, but I can see how it's upsetting you.” It's critical for you to realize that whenever a patient is experiencing perceptual distortions, other sensory input can be equally distorted and become equally frightening. Avoid touching patients who are actively hallucinating without telling them that you're going to touch them. Patients who are hallucinating may interpret sensory input in a way other than you intended. For patients experiencing auditory hallucinations, some of the time it's blatant enough that they'll respond to the voices. Often, you can pick this up through subtle behavior. You see the patient moving his or her head or lips as if responding to something in the environment. You should then ask, “Are you hearing voices?” If the answer is yes, then say, “What are the voices telling you?” It's important to know the content of auditory hallucinations: there's a difference between voices making benign statements and voices telling the patient to harm him- or herself or someone else (command hallucinations). When a patient hears auditory imperative or command hallucinations, stay with the patient and constantly observe him or her. In review, to communicate effectively, you should use your own style, listen for themes, speak simply and concretely, indicate when you don't understand, avoid disagreeing with delusions, share your perception of reality, and remain with the patient having auditory command hallucinations. Awareness and sensitivity needed Care of the patient with acute psychosis requires your awareness of the sensory-perceptual problems he or she is experiencing and being able to apply that awareness to specific situations. Care also requires you to be sensitive to the patient's feelings and preserve as much of his or her dignity as possible. Doing so will positively influence patients' progress during the rehabilitative phase of their illness. consider thisFigureMr. M talked nonstop about fulfilling his messianic mission. He repeatedly emphasized that in the second millennium, he would exalt the 12 tribes of Israel and the saved would number only 2,000. Often, he stopped midsentence and asked, “Do you understand?” To which I replied, “No, I don't understand.” Frustrated, Mr. M, said, “Of course, you wouldn't understand. You don't have superior, Godly intelligence.” Then he grabbed my legal pad and pencil, and wrote the numerals 2, 12, and 2,000 while continuing to rant. At this point, I said, “What I do understand is that you wrote the numbers 2, 12, and 2,000 on my paper.” Mr. M stopped ranting and said, “Yes, I wrote 2, 12, and 2,000 on your paper. Would you like to see my drawings? They're in my room.” Analysis: This patient was talking through his delusion at a rapid pace, anxiously wanting to be understood. When I finally validated something we could both agree on, he ceased his ranting and invited me to see his artwork. Five therapeutic principles Show acceptance without value judgment. Observe the patient's verbal and nonverbal cues. Focus on the patient's feelings. Be honest and direct. Actively listen. Suggestions for communication Listen for themes. Speak simply and concretely. Anticipate the patient's experience. Ask if the patient is hallucinating; if so, ask if he or she is hearing voices and what they're saying. Avoid disagreeing with delusions or asking detailed questions about them. Notice the patient's nonverbal cues; look for incongruence with what he or she says. Stay with the patient who's having auditory imperative or command hallucinations. consider thisFigureMs. R stood in a corner of the day room waiting her turn for morning snacks, which included peanut butter and sliced apples. When she finally approached, I asked her pleasantly if she would like a piece of apple. She responded with a deep and furious growl, “I don't want an apple unless there's a snake wrapped around it.” Instead of trying to interpret Ms. R's imagery, I simply said, “I'm not going to harm you with this apple slice. Apples are good for us...see,” and I bit into the apple slice. Ms. R reluctantly took two apple slices and some peanut butter. Analysis: Rather than rush to interpret Ms. R's response as an allusion to the Genesis narrative about Eve, the serpent, forbidden fruit, original sin, and guilt, I responded to the process. Ms. R was fearful and I spoke to her fear. Epilogue: Eight days later, as she was preparing for discharge, Ms. R sat next to me and said, “I'm sorry for the way I spoke to you that day you offered me the apple. I know I scared many of the other patients, including my roommate. I was scared, too. I saw the snake as vividly as I see you now.” on the webFigure American Psychiatric Association: http://www.psychiatry.org/schizophrenia Cleveland Clinic: http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/psychiatry-psychology/schizophrenia-acute-psychosis Mayo Clinic: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/basics/definition/con-20021077 National Alliance on Mental Illness: http://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Schizophrenia National Institute of Mental Health: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/mental_health/management/schizophrenia/en",

Originally, as ‘adjustment reaction’, it was one of a very few disorder categories included in major psychiatric classification schemes specifically for use in children and adolescents. In DSM-I, for instance, adjustment reaction and childhood schizophrenia were the only two categories of childhood psychiatric disorder. The intention was to indicate that some instances of disordered behaviour or emotions arose specifically because of an identified stressor rather than, say, a process of mental illness. The source of stress was originally thought of as including both external events (such as bereavement) or an internal developmental process, which might require significant adaptation of mental functioning (such as maturational changes during adolescence). There was an implicit idea that adjustment to adversity or intra-psychic conflict could be either adaptive or maladaptive. If it was maladaptive, then personal dysfunction was to be seen as a psychiatric condition.",

In most cases, the trauma recalled was child sexual abuse, but in some cases the trauma was ritual abuse by satanic covens. Therapists who treat such patients theorize that memories of extremely traumatic events, especially of early sexual molestation, are so painful that they are barred from awareness by repression or dissociation.1 “Repressed” memories are those that are strictly forbidden to surface, while “dissociated” memories are allowed expression only when the patient is in an alternate state of mind, as in MPD. Whether in the context of MPD or another disorder, repressed or dissociated memories are thought to cause various symptoms, both mental and physical. Patients with repressed memories of childhood rape, for example, may fear intimacy with others or have undiagnosable pelvic pain.",

      "title": "Harm reduction psychotherapy: an innovative alternative to classical addictions theory.",
      "abstract": "Harm Reduction Psychotherapy is an innovative treatment for people with alcohol and other drug problems. Unlike the traditional disease model of addiction, HRP uses a biopsychosocial approach to understand the complexities of drug use, abuse, and addiction. In other words, in the context of HRP, addiction is not the primary issue. Rather, it is an interactive phenomenon in which the relative weight of biology, psychology, and social factors varies for each person and for each drug he or she uses. HRP allows us to assess each person individually and to plan treatment that is tailored to the individual's relationship with alcohol and other drugs. It also incorporates other important problems: emotional disorders, family problems, social alienation, and medical complications. These issues are discussed at the beginning of consultation, without patients having to focus solely on their alcohol or drug problem. The unique aspect to HRP is that patients do not have to commit to abstinence as a condition of, or even necessarily as a goal of, treatment. HRP seeks to identify and work with the barriers to treatment adherence in any patient. It is clear that most medical patients have some difficulty understanding and adhering to medical recommendations and treatment protocols. However, drug users have particular problems that must be identified. HRP helps people create individual strategies to decrease harmful alcohol and drug use. It uses a nonjudgmental and collaborative approach to actively encourage individuals to explore their own barriers to change and to choose among a range of options such as abstinence, moderation, or other short-term goals. Motivational interviewing can be used to motivate behavioral change with the goal of reducing the effects of adverse consequences.",

      "abstract": "Aggressiveness is a threatening behavior that results in mental, physical or material harm. It can be directed towards oneself, towards other persons or towards objects / things. Aggression can be expressed physically, verbally or even by neglect. Aggression in individuals depends on various risk factors and factors that influence the dose of aggression and therefore aggressive escalation. As in society and in the population, so do aggressive individuals find themselves in psychiatric wards. There are various psychic conditions that lead to an aggressive act. Schizophrenic patients can act aggressively as well as people who are in an alcohol overdose or people who have been overdosed on opioid substances. Any patient who tries to injure himself, another person, or who tries to cause great material damage shall endeavor to be taken care of by non-punitive or coercive methods. Deescalation procedures based on communication with the patient and using communication skills through which the patient seeks to calm down with words and the atmosphere during communication are cited as non-striking methods. Coercive methods are only used when non-coercive methods have failed. Forcing methods include pharmacological therapy, isolation and physical restraint. Pharmacological therapy involves the appeasement of the patient by administering therapy or medication. Isolation is the process of separating an aggressive patient from other patients from the ward into a specially arranged room where he or she resides until the physician estimates that the patient can return to the room where he or she resides with other patients. Physical restraint is the last phase of coercive methods, it involves the humane physical restraint of the patient with the aim of calming the patient and ceasing to be aggressive. The extremities, head and chest are fixed. The patient is unbound only when the physician determines by psychophysical assessment that the patient no longer needs to be fixed. Education is a very important process in such cases. Educating staff eliminates their possible fear or insecurity and increases the security of all people in the department where aggressive escalation can occur.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Because of its important social impact, psychopathic personality (psychopathy) is one of the most studied personality disorders. Psychopathy is characterized by distinctive emotional (shallow affect, lack of remorse or shame, callousness), interpersonal (charm, grandiosity, deceitfulness, manipulativeness), and behavioral features (impulsivity, irresponsibility, norm‐violating acts). Antisocial personality disorder (APD) comprises a related, but distinguishable syndrome. The diagnostic criteria for APD include extensive coverage of behavioral deviancy in childhood and adulthood but limited coverage of affective and interpersonal features.",

      "title": "THE MYTH OF THE PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY",
      "abstract": "1. The concept of psychopathic personality is at present in a transitional state. While most clinical workers in the field still move at the superficial descriptive level, some attempt for delimitation is already being made, though it is still mainly at the descriptive level; while a few, as yet in great minority, are attempting to interpret the reaction in terms of underlying dynamics, emphasizing motivation rather than behavior. 2. One of the greatest difficulties in the whole situation is that the majority of writers do not offer adequately worked up case material, which therefore precludes a dynamic formulation. 3. Some workers appear to get away from the previously held concept that the condition is hereditary and constitutional. Instead, the emphasis on psychogenesis appears to be gaining ground. Unfortunately, this remains for the most a statement without casuistic material to support it. 4. Equally, the grouping is being more and more narrowed, and some workers exclude from the consideration of psychopathy the psychotic reaction types, even if and when they have an undoubted antisocial and delinquent character. But the great variety of hysterical and neurotic conditions are still grouped with psychopathy, when these conditions include some definite anti-social and delinquent behavior. 5. On the basis of carefully studied material and due consideration being given to dynamics of the situation, the following reorientation is offered, namely: a. That what is commonly diagnosed now as psychopathic personality should be divided into two main groups: the symptomatic or secondary psychopathy, and primary, essential, or idiopathic psychopathy. b. Under the heading of symptomatic or secondary psychopathy are to be included those cases of psychoses and neuroses that have a strong antisocial or delinquent aspect, and the case in question should be put into its proper clinical heading (psychosis or neurosis as the case may be). Thus a case may be diagnosed as manic-depressive psychosis, hypomania, antisocial delinquent trends. The term psychopathic, therefore, may be completely eliminated from this group of cases as being only confusing. c. The clinical worker who puts emphasis on motivation rather than behavior will have no difficulty uncovering pointed psychogenesis in all these cases. By the same token they are amenable to psychotherapeutic treatment and therefore offer a far more hopeful outlook than is currently given to psychopathic cases. d. In the remaining small group are to be put those individuals who do not fit at all into any of the cardinal reaction types; above all they seem to lack any psychogenetic aspect even when definite effort has been made to elicit the same. They form a disease of its own designated as anethopathy, a specific mental disease, characterized by a special personality organization having in particular a virtual absence of any redeeming social reaction: conscience, guilt, binding and generous emotions, etc., while purely egoistic, uninhibited instinctive trends are predominant. They are as close to the constitutional as can be found. The term psychopathic personality may be omitted from these cases too. 6. With the larger number of psychopathic personality cases being properly put under the respective headings of the cardinal reaction types, and the balance being put in a new group designated anethopathy, nothing remains of the original concept of psychopathic personality, for which reason it should be completely deleted from psychiatric nosology. The term may be left entirely for lay use. 7. A number of cases have been cited demonstrating the various types of psychopathic personality with emphasis on the dynamics of the situation.",

If of early onset (before 7 years), present in different settings and to a degree that causes functional impairment, a diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ‘hyperkinetic disorder’ should be considered. The age criterion is crucial to distinguish ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder from later-onset conditions such as agitated depression, adolescent-onset socialised conduct disorder (probably not linked to ADHD) or hypomania, that might appear superficially similar. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and hyperkinetic disorder are commonly associated with language, learning and social impairments. Indeed, in severe cases hyperactivity could be a marker of a multifaceted developmental disorder. Hence, competent assessment usually requires a thorough history, often using a number of sources.",

      "title": "Psychological-Mindedness as a Defense",
      "abstract": "Many patients seen today use sophisticated capacities for psychological reflection and premature synthesis to ward off knowledge of more primitive conflict and islands of unintegration. They show a precocious talent for free association, a talent they perversely misuse. Similarly, they enjoy access to a rich fantasy life, even as they subtly impoverish it. Effective therapeutic work requires that they suffer „traumatization”—experiences of dedifferentiation that undermine their considerable capacity to know what they feel and think. Structural and process variables interact with content variables in complex and ambiguous ways. As a consequence, estimates of the authenticity and „fit” of personal and interpersonal experiences and behaviors of both partners in the therapeutic encounter become necessarily involved. Such factors may increase the possibility of misunderstandings, but also of more authentic and firmly grounded understandings. Similar issues are eventually revealed in these patients' early lives, where psychological and other formulaic understandings were prematurely applied to offset overwhelmedness and other unarticulable experiences; the patientapos;s talents for ambiguity, irony, self-soothing, or responsiveness to others were, in effect, exploited at the expense of full psychological growth. Versions of this clinical presentation may be increasingly common in a new generation of analyzable patients. Clinical work with them is facilitated by a synthesis of contemporary developmental, structural, and object relations theory.",

      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that is common and usually causes substantial distress and impairment in psychosocial functioning. BDD is associated with markedly poor quality of life and high rates of suicidal ideation and behavior. The first-line pharmacologic approach is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, often at relatively high doses; serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also recommended for patients with delusional BDD beliefs. The first-line psychosocial treatment is manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy that is tailored to BDD's unique clinical features; it is not recommended that therapists simply apply cognitive-behavioral approaches for other disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Because insight is so often absent or poor in BDD, motivational interviewing techniques are often needed to engage and retain patients in treatment. Cosmetic treatment (e.g., surgery or dermatologic treatment) is not recommended because it appears to only rarely improve BDD symptoms and can even make them worse. BDD has many similarities to OCD and is probably closely related to OCD, but the two disorders also have some important differences. From a clinical perspective, the most important differences are that BDD is characterized by poorer insight, more frequent comorbid major depressive disorder and substance use disorders, and more frequent suicidality. Although treatment approaches have similarities to those for OCD, effective cognitive-behavioral therapy for BDD meaningfully differs from that for OCD.",

These symptoms are experience for over 1 month, but in some cases, symptom onset may be delayed. Due to the severity of the comorbid depression and/or anxiety disorders, sleep disturbance and anger, many patients are unable to focus on psychological treatment without the assistance of pharmacotherapy. Factors that contribute to recovery include the presence of positive social and community supports and an empathetic therapeutic relationship. Factors such as substance abuse and antisocial personality can have a negative effect on the response to treatment. (author abstract)",

The clinical evolution and prognosis of these patients are still discouraging. Although are less disruptive for families and society, negative and cognitive symptoms heavily precede the psychotic onset of schizophrenia and have the tendency to persist even after the remission of the disease’s positive symptoms, sometimes considered as a state of psychic defect. These two symptomatic dimensions have the highest share in influencing disability and in the reduction of the autonomy degree of these patients. In the last decades, other cerebral neurotransmission pathways have been identified, and their dysfunction are supposed to underpin the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Highlighting the contribution of cholinergic, glutamatergic and serotonergic receptors, along with the role of other dopaminergic receptors besides those previously known have generated hope for the development of a new psychotropic class that can specifically target these types of symptoms.",

Among these domains, cognitive dysfunction has received considerable attention as a possible endophenotype for BD, with some suggestion that changes in cognitive function may antedate onset of mood symptoms in individuals at risk for BD. Domains of social cognition, including emotion comprehension, theory of mind, and empathy, along with autobiographical memory, represent understudied aspects of psychological function that may be dysfunctional in people with BD. Temperament and personality factors, such as ruminative tendencies and neuroticism, may also leave some people vulnerable to mood instability. This review summarises the evidence for dysfunction in each of these domains for people with BD and examines whether there is any evidence that this dysfunction antedates the onset of mood symptoms or confers risk for illness.",

Cycloid psychoses and bouffée delirante are recognized in ICD-10 under the name of acute polymorphic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.0) and with symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.1). Objectives Clinical case Methods We present the case of a 16-year-old patient with no psychiatric history, with medical background of epilepsy; she was in fllow-up by Neurology and in treatment with valproate.Neurology indicates to stop treatment; it is then whwn the patient begins to appear disoriented, confused, with significant anguish and lability and regressive behaviors.She has sudden mood swings (from laughing to crying); sudden changes in emotional reaction (from distress to anger) and sudden changes in behavior (from agitation to prostration); verbiage with pressure of speech and dysprosodia; delusional ideation and incongruous affect; visual, auditive and kinesthetic hallucinations with important repercussion. We request blood and urine tests, drug test, EEG, cranial MRI. Results She presents fluctuating, polymorphic and unstable affective and psychotic symptoms. What is the most appropriate diagnosis? We treat the patient with antipsychotic, mood stabilizer and anxiolytic treatment. Conclusions Psychopathology in early ages is not so clearly defined and it can take very different forms. The diagnosis of cycloid psychosis can be useful as well as necessary to describe certain patients with similar characteristics and different from other groups.

When episodes of depersonalization are recurrent or persistent and lead to distress or dysfunction, the diagnosis of depersonalization disorder is made. Certain similarities in phenomenology, comorbidity, neurochemistry, and treatment response suggest a relationship to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. However, depersonalization is a very poorly studied condition, and any conclusions must be viewed tentatively.

      "abstract": "The majority of first-episode psychoses are preceded by a prodromal phase that is several years on average, frequently leads to some decline in psychosocial functioning and offers the opportunity for early detection within the framework of an indicated prevention. To this, two approaches are currently mainly followed. The ultra-high-risk (UHR) criteria were explicitly developed to predict first-episode psychosis within 12 months, and indeed the majority of conversions in clinical UHR samples seem to occur within the first 12 months of initial assessment. Their main criterion, the attenuated psychotic symptoms criterion, captures symptoms that resemble positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) with the exception that some level of insight is still maintained, and these frequently compromise functioning already. In contrast, the basic symptom criteria try to catch patients at increased risk of psychoses at the earliest possible time, i.e. ideally when only the first subtle disturbances in information processing have developed that are experienced with full insight and do not yet overload the person's coping abilities, and thus have not yet resulted in any functional decline. First results from prospective studies not only support this view, but indicate that the combination of both approaches might be a more favorable way to increase sensitivity and detect risk earlier, as well as to establish a change-sensitive risk stratification approach.",

      "title": "Insight into psychosis in patients in the early stages of psychotic disorders and their parents",
      "abstract": "Introduction Clinically insight is a multifaceted phenomenon related to acceptance of one’s condition as being psychiatrically ill, recognition of symptoms as pathological, recognition of the social consequences of illness and treatment acceptance. The common features of psychotic disorders are symptoms classified through several dimensions: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive symptoms, affective symptoms and psychomotor symptoms. These symptoms often cause impaired reality testing and poor insight. Impaired insight is common during early stage of psychosis with its prevalence ranging from around 30-50% and may cause treatment delays, more severe symptoms, poorer treatment adherence, involuntary admissions, potentially aggressive behaviour, poorer social functioning and outcomes. Insight is directly related to the severity of psychotic symptoms and inversely related to depression score. Enviromental factors such as family beliefs and stigma can influence on insight level. Considering that the first symptoms of psychosis often appear in young adulthood while the affected still live with their parents, we believe that the role of parental insight is important in recognizing the signs and treating psychosis. Objectives Aim of this study was to investigate level of patient’s and parent’s insight into early psychosis. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study on 105 diads parents - children suffering from early stage of the psychotic disorders, during disease &lt; 5 years, diagnoses from the spectrum F20-F29, both sexes, aged 18-35 years who were hospitalized at “Sveti Ivan” Psychiatry Clinic. The purpose and objectives of the research were explained to all participants, and they signed informed consent. The instruments used: sociodemographic questionnaire, The Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder - Abbreviated version (SUMD), The Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS) – The Five factor models, Clinical Global Impression-severity scale (CGI-s). The research was conducted in accordance with Helsinki declaration. Results Among the patients, the male gender is slightly more represented, with a good level of education, mostly with the F23 diagnosis, while in the group of parents, mothers are significantly more represented. On the PANSS Five Factor scale, the patients showed significant improvement in all domains. The patients were more aware of their disorder than their parents. The fathers were more aware of their children’s disorders than mothers. Conclusions The research has contributed to clarifying the complexity of the issue of insight and complex relationships between parents and children, pointing to the necessity of family psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions in the treatment of patients in the early stages of psychotic disorders.

      "title": "RANGE OF PSYCHIATRIC MATERIAL WITHIN THE STATE SCHOOL",
      "abstract": "The cases so briefly cited above represent only a few of the endless variations in personally and character found within the state school. It may be said that clinical study of the mentally defective in state schools reveals one series of psychiatric disorders and the study of patients within the state hospital another series. These series of psychiatric disorders frequently overlap. The psychiatrist in the state school is faced with the necessity of developing large scale or selective group therapy as well as individual therapy for individuals with subnormal intelligence(10). The psychiatrist must deal not only with defects in intelligence but also with defects in conation, feeling, emotion, temperament and character(II). With the familial types, psychiatric therapy has to be directed distinctly along social and eugenical lines in reference to the individual and to the group. With disorders due to specific genetic, metabolic, traumatic or infectional factors, psychiatric therapy must be related more directly toward the individual. Psychiatric therapy for the psychotic defective is often times a matter of hospital attention. Psychotherapy for the psychoneurotic defective, or for the psychopathic defective, may be a matter of institutionalization or of intensive individual attention. Psychotherapy for the behavior disorders of childhood as found in defectives should include formally organized psychiatric or mental hygiene services within both the institution and the community. The large numbers of subnormal individuals within the community-at-large, considered especially in relation to the present-day social pressures, call for increased attention to the psychiatric needs of the subnormal groups—whether within the institution or within the community.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "title": "Neurological Signs and the Heterogeneity of Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "title": "Transition to adulthood",
      "abstract": "Most adult mental illnesses begin in adolescence and early adulthood. They affect a young person's ability to meet their full potential in terms of relationships, family functioning and educational and occupational attainment. One mental disorder may also predispose to another; for example, anxiety may lead to depression and/or substance abuse, so that individuals often exhibit a range of symptoms and difficulties. The other problem is that mental illnesses in young people, if left untreated, are likely to continue into adulthood and be associated with a range of poor outcomes. Clearly a focus on youth mental health is needed. Early intervention to prevent, or at the least delay, the onset of mental illness could minimise the associated damage to a young person's social, educational and vocational functioning. The clinical staging model of mental illnesses provides a framework for this preventative approach. The model posits that mental disorders emerge in stages of varying severity and that over time symptoms may worsen and new clinical features may emerge. Individuals thus move through these stages, from mild to more severe presentations. The model suggests that if interventions are applied appropriately to each stage, then progression to more severe levels may be prevented. Interventions delivered during the early stages of an illness will be more effective and less harmful than treatments delivered later in the course of illness. Interventions can be evaluated in terms of their ability to prevent or delay progression to a later stage of illness. This chapter discusses the rationale for this approach.",

Major symptoms such as deficits in social reciprocity, deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, which are common in Developmental Disorders, strongly affect work performance. Some workers with Developmental Disorders suffer from other psychiatric conditions because of maladjustment to the work environment, while the manifestation of Developmental Disorders in workers is also influenced by the work environment. Occupational health staff should have sufficient of understanding of the difficulties and psychological suffering of such workers to be able to support their health and continuous employment. Support for mild cases as well as severe cases is sometimes difficult because it may give the impression of unfairness or cause a degeneration of morale among co-workers. It is necessary to have detailed discussions about the future development of support systems for workers with Developmental Disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Among the myriad of anthropomorphic qualities lavished on the frontal lobes, they have been proclaimed the ultimate seat of morality. Does this mean that the underdevelopment of or damage to the frontal lobes will result in immorality? Probably not, but how about amorality? Enter the orbitofrontal syndrome. This syndrome is in many ways the opposite of the dorsolateral syndrome. Patients with orbitofrontal syndrome are emotionally disinhibited. Their affect is rarely neutral, constantly oscillating between euphoria and rage, with impulse control ranging from poor to nonexistent. Their ability to inhibit the urge for instant gratification is severely impaired. They do what they feel like doing when they feel like doing it, without any concern for social taboos or legal prohibitions. They have no foresight of the consequences of their actions. A patient afflicted with the orbitofrontal syndrome (due to head injury, cerebrovascular illness, or dementia) will engage in shoplifting, sexually aggressive behavior, reckless driving, or other actions commonly perceived as antisocial. These patients are known to be selfish, boastful, puerile, profane, and sexually explicit. Their humor is off-color and their jocularity, known as Witzelsucht, resembles that of a drunken adolescent.",

      "abstract": "People in depressions are submitted to a suffering which always necessitates, in addition to pharmacotherapy, a psychotherapeutic approach. In all the psychotherapies known, a certain attitude of the therapist, which includes an unconditional openness for the patient is necessary. Depressives cannot bear banal optimism, but need the therapist's confidence in their future. This human participation helps to fill up, at least to a certain degree, their lack of narcissism. Special points of psychotherapy of depressives are described: positive emotional attention, empathy, unconditional listening, asking questions (to give the patient's word and attitudes a meaning and to activate cognitive processes), more orientation than interpretation (during depressive phases), giving advice: Whereas in most psychotherapies it is counterindicated to counsel the patient, in major depressions it can be necessary to formulate recommendations, getting conscious about what happened during the therapeutic session in the patient and in the therapist, since otherwise the therapist may get too involved in the depressive's unrealistic expectations or too defensive against him. Psychotherapy with depressives does not only mean individual treatment, but can include--possibly in addition--their social environment: Partner therapy, family therapy, of the use of a social system as a milieu for psychotherapy (group psychotherapy). Whereas psychotherapy in the depressive phases consists mainly in the named procedure, in the intervals, the experiences of the depressive phases and the emotional and cognitive life and behavior patterns should be worked through focally, in an analytically oriented short-term psychotherapy. A long-term analytic treatment is only indicated in depressive neurotics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, special considerations are required for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood social anxiety disorder.

One barrier to addressing impaired insight is the absence of a comprehensive model of how poor insight develops.Areas covered: To explore this issue we review how poor insight is the result of multiple phenomena which interfere with the construction of narrative accounts of psychiatric challenges, rather than a single social or biological cause.Expert commentary: We propose an integrative model of poor insight in schizophrenia which involves the interaction of symptoms, deficits in neurocognition, social cognition, metacognition, and stigma.

      "title": "Pharmacopsychotherapy and Psychosomatics",
      "abstract": "1. Psychosomatic disturbances are seen as constituting a special form of neuroses. Aside from psychodynamic processes which must remain the prerogative of psychotherapeutics, there are in the etiology and pathogenesis of psychosomatic disturbances (as of other forms of neurosis) cyclothymic as well as cerebro-organic psychopathological syndrome components. The endogenous-biological and exogenouscerebral factors entering into the situation are analyzed in the introduction and in the first chapter of the body of the text with the objective of supplying a theoretical justification of the pharmacopsychotherapeutic approach to the treatment of psychosomatic syndromes. 2. Psychosomatic disturbances are defined, in heuristic and preliminary terms, within the frame of a four-point scale. The points of the scale are 1. organic disturbance or lesion, 2. endogenousbiological or exogenous-cerebral syndrome components, 3. neurotic structural elements of personality, and 4. syndrome shift. The relationship between syndrome shift and pharmacopsychotherapy is twofold. On the one hand pharmacopsychotherapeutic factors can cause syndrome shift, and on the other hand special pharmacopsychotherapeutic indications emerge from certain forms of syndrome shift (for details, see Part B, Section II). 3. Gastroenteric syndromes are used for the purpose of a paradigmatic presentation of the specific characteristics of psychosomatic pharmacopsychotherapeutics. 4. On the basis of data derived from his personal experience, the author presents sketches of the pharmacopsychotherapeutic approach to the treatment of psychosomatic conditions with the subheadings of allergoses, obesity, hypertension, cardiophobia, migraine, other forms of pain, and hypochondria (see Part C, Section II). 5. In the concluding section of the second half of the monograph (dealing with applications) the author reviews synoptically his own chosen arsenal of pharmacopsychotherapeutic modalities of attack in the field of psychosomatics. With respect to all the drugs mentioned, emphasis is placed on the subjective viewpoint of the individual physician.",

      "title": "Paranoid Delusional Disorder Follows Social Anxiety Disorder in a Long-Term Case Series",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients may have self-referential ideas and share other cognitive processes with paranoid delusional disorder (PDD) patients. From an evolutionary perspective, SAD may derive from biologically instinctive social hierarchy ranking, thus causing an assumption of inferior social rank, and thus prompting concerns about mistreatment from those of perceived higher rank. This naturalistic longitudinal study followed four patients with initial SAD and later onset of PDD. These four patients show the same sequence of diagnosed SAD followed by diagnosed PDD, as is often retrospectively described by other PDD patients. Although antipsychotic medication improved psychotic symptoms in all patients, those who also had adjunctive serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors for SAD had much more improvement in both psychosis and social functioning. From an evolutionary perspective, it can be conjectured that when conscious modulation of the SAD social rank instinct is diminished due to hypofrontality (common to many psychotic disorders), then unmodulated SAD can lead to paranoid delusional disorder, with prominent ideas of reference. Non-psychotic SAD may be prodromal or causal for PDD.",

Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and prolonged grief disorder may accompany ambiguous loss. No treatment guidelines are available on how to address these symptoms. We performed a literature review aimed at identifying empirically based treatment interventions applicable across a variety of settings. In relatives of missing persons with high levels of distress, holding on to hope that the loved one will return may be seen as a strategy to avoid emotions associated with the thought that the separation is permanent. However, pressure for closure paradoxically leads to increased resistance and may in the context of enforced disappearance serve politically repressive aims. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and prolonged grief may be addressed using empirically supported interventions, including psycho-education, mobilizing social support, exposure, and behavioral activation. Exposure-based interventions for ambiguous loss should not focus on closure or coming to terms with the irreversibility of the loss, but on tolerating the ambiguity surrounding the loss.",

      "title": "Psychopathy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychopathy is also known as psychopathic, antisocial, dissocial , and sociopathic personality disorder . It is a specific form of personality disorder that comprises a broad range of symptoms. The general course is characterized by onset in childhood and persistence into late adulthood. It can be diagnosed according to criteria in standard nosologies, although specialized psychometric procedures are often preferred by forensic mental health professionals. Using broad diagnostic criteria, estimates of lifetime prevalence in the United States were found to range from ∼1.5 to 3.5% in the general population and 50–75% in forensic populations; estimates based on more stringent diagnostic criteria are about one‐third of these rates. Psychopathy appears to be more prevalent in males, in younger generations, and in individualistic cultures; this may be due to symptom expression being facilitated by norms that promote strong individualism or, alternatively, to bias in the existing diagnostic criteria. Psychopathy is frequently comorbid with substance use disorders and some other personality disorders. The etiology of psychopathy is unknown. No reliably effective treatment for psychopathy has been identified. Psychopathy is associated with serious crime, including violence, and is often considered in psycholegal evaluations related to risk assessment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A person with schizophrenia is more prone to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) when compared to the general population. Schizo-obsessive disorder is diagnosed when a person has schizophrenia with co-existing OCD or OCS. It is associated with depressive symptoms, no definitive diagnostic criteria and has poor response to polypharmacotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old-man with no significant family history and symptoms suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia, was on intermittent treatment for 6 years. Since the past one year, he also had OCS and depressive symptoms – constantly checking himself if he passed stools, reduced appetite, disturbed sleep, suicidal thoughts. He has multiple hospital visits where they have changed the anti-psychotics and their dosage, given electro-convulsive therapy, but couldn’t be relieved of his symptoms. He was started on high dose antipsychotics of two different classes and serotonin agonists, but still did not improve. CONCLUSION: Schizo-obsessive disorder is a diagnostic difficulty to the clinician, reported to have poor prognosis. It significantly affects one’s general, social and occupational functioning. Research is required on its psychopathology, treatment protocols and its diagnostic criteria is yet to be established. Antidepressant, depression, insight, internalized stigma",

      "title": "Depression After Encephalitis",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Very few data exist explaining the relationship between major depressive disorder, insomnia, and encephalitis. This case report presents a patient who was mentally stable until suffering an episode of encephalitis. Afterward, he developed depression and insomnia and began following up with psychiatry.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A is a 29-year-old man with a history significant for generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and insomnia dating back to 2012 and migraines, which started before 2012, who is not taking any psychotropic medications. He presented to the psychiatry clinic to establish care, as he had recently moved to the area and was previously receiving care from a mental health provider at another facility. He described the move as a “positive” event and lives with his mother and stepfather. He reports that he has good relations with his parents and a good social support network. He describes his mood as depressed, and his affect is constricted. He denies feeling suicidal and ever having suicidal thoughts. Depression has not interfered with his relationship with his parents but has interfered with his capacity to work. He reports that depression and low energy were reasons for his dismissal from a previous job, as well as for moving in with his parents. He is currently unemployed and states that he has low energy, anhedonia, insomnia, hopelessness, and poor concentration.\r\n\r\nMr A reported an episode of encephalitis in June of 2012, when he was hospitalized for 3 weeks. The hospital records were obtained and confirmed his report. While he was hospitalized for viral encephalitis, an electroencephalogram showed diffuse encephalopathy, and a magnetic resonance image of the brain showed a lesion within the splenium of the corpus callosum. Mr A stated that his depressive symptoms began 1 week after hospitalization. He noticed feeling “down,” and sleep was reduced from 8 to 6 hours per night. He reports adequate opportunity to sleep, but he has a hard time falling and staying asleep. He has not had sleep studies done, and the insomnia has been attributed to depression.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to suggest that childhood encephalitis or meningitis leads to psychiatric disorders later on in life, specifically schizophrenia spectrum disorders.1 There is also evidence that encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus may cause affective dysfunction.2 Although it is still early to draw conclusions, it is worth further investigation. In our patient, it is of note that there was a restriction lesion in the splenium, which is close to the pineal gland. This type of restriction lesion has been found in other cases of encephalitis and is usually transient and nonspecific. It occurs with mostly viral infections, as is suspected in the case described here.3 What is interesting is the proximity of the pineal gland to the splenium and the role of the pineal gland in sleep, as well as its association with depression.4 It is speculative at this point, but is it possible that Mr A had some damage to his pineal gland during his encephalitis episode?\r\n\r\nIn a study looking at psychological sequelae in patients infected with the West Nile virus, a cohort of 171 participants was followed for 8 years. It was found that 35% of these participants developed clinical depression. Depending on gender and degree of physical disability, some developed more severe depression.5\r\n\r\nMr A developed major depressive disorder. He has had consistent symptoms of depression, with no episodes of remission. If his symptoms continue until June 2014, he will meet DSM-5 criteria for persistent depressive disorder, since he first developed symptoms in June 2012. This case highlights the importance for patients with encephalitis to be closely monitored by their primary care physician for any signs or symptoms of clinical depression. It is clear that there are not enough studies on the relationship between brain infections and depression, but from what exists, the relationship seems worthy of further investigation and research.",

      "abstract": "Onset of schizophrenia after the age of 40 has been a controversial topic. We reviewed more than 30 publications (mainly from Europe) on this subject. Many of the studies had methodological shortcomings, including problems in precisely dating the onset of schizophrenia. Nonetheless, it appears that a certain proportion of patients present for the first time with diagnosable schizophrenia after age 40. Late-onset schizophrenia is characterized by paranoid symptomatology, a high female:male ratio, an elevated prevalence of hearing loss and ocular pathology, schizoid or paranoid traits in premorbid personality, a tendency toward chronicity, and symptomatic improvement with neuroleptics. Family studies suggest that the prevalence of schizophrenia in relatives of late-onset schizophrenic probands is higher than that in the general population, but lower than that in relatives of earlier-onset schizophrenic probands. We believe that late-onset schizophrenia is a valid entity (or group of entities). Studies of the course, biological associations, neuropsychological performance, and pharmacological characterization of late-onset schizophrenia are warranted.",

      "title": "Psychosis risk syndrome is not prodromal psychosis.",
      "abstract": "One of the most exciting trends in schizophrenia research is the shift in focus from treatment studies to studies about the early identification and prevention of schizophrenia. These studies have primarily focused on adolescents or young adults with prodromal symptoms or on clinically high-risk individuals who show similar impairments in cognitive and social functioning to those seen in individuals with schizophrenia and, thus, are considered at high risk of developing schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. Some researchers have labeled this condition as psychosis risk syndrome (PRS). There are moves in some circles to re-define the condition as a disorder in its own right: the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5(th) edition (DSM-5), lists 'attenuated psychosis syndrome' (APS) in the appendix as a condition for further study. Individuals with PRS are certainly at higher risk of developing a psychotic disorder than those without PRS, but the majority of those with PRS do not subsequently develop a psychotic disorder, so we argue against the inclusion of PRS or APS as a subtype of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. 精神分裂症研究中最令人振奋的趋势之一是从治疗学研究转向精神分裂症的早期识别和早期干预研究。后者的研究对象主要集中于处于精神病“前驱期”或“临床高危”的青少年或年轻的成年患者，他们出现的认知功能障碍和社会功能障碍与精神分裂症患者相似，因而被认为具有精神分裂症或其他精神病性障碍的高患病风险。有学者将这种认知和社会功能障碍的表现称为精神病风险综合征（psychosis risk syndrome, PRS）。在某些范围内已有试图将这一状态重新定义为一种精神障碍的举动，如：美国精神医学学会的《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》第五版（DSM-5）将“轻微精神病综合征”（attenuated psychosis syndrome, APS）列入“需要进一步研究的状态”。存在PRS的个体出现精神病性障碍的风险的确比没有PRS的人要高，但多数PRS个体以后也不会患精神病性障碍，因此，我们反对将PRS或APS作为一种亚型列入精神分裂症谱系障碍中。.本文全文中文版从2015年4月8日起在http://dx.doi.org/10.11919/j.issn.1002-0829.214178可供免费阅览下载.",

      "abstract": "Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a diagnosis characterized by a wide array of symptoms. In the absence of apparent neurological deficits, behavioral abnormalities alone make SDH a difficult diagnosis. Chronic subdural hematoma presents with alteration in sensorium, raised intracranial pressure, and motor weakness. Depending on the degree of cerebral compression and location, convulsions or personality changes can also be seen. Common psychiatric manifestation with CSDH is a cognitive impairment which may mimic delirium or dementia. We report a case of an elderly male with no prior psychiatric history who developed insidious psychotic symptoms.Patient is an 83-year-old male with no prior psychiatric history brought in by police for making suicidal and homicidal threats to family members with increasingly aggressive behavior. He later endorsed a 3-week history of depression symptomatology related to a recent motor vehicle accident. Prior history of chronic myeloid leukemia, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia with an unremarkable family and social history. On evaluation, the patient was uncooperative, irritable, and verbally aggressive. Laboratory testing, EKG, and MMSE were performed and grossly normal. Noncontrast head CT demonstrated bilateral chronic subdural hematomas. The patient refused neurology consult and proposed interventions but was compliant with risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily. His delusions and aggressive behavior improved drastically and was discharged.Chronic Subdural Hematoma (CSDH) is amongst the most common neurosurgical conditions in the United States with an incidence of 10 per 100,000 annually. Risk factors for CSDH include age, male gender, trauma, coagulopathy, chronic alcoholism, vascular malformations, and metastatic tumors. Noncontrast head CT is diagnostic for CSDH, but MRI should be considered in acute ischemia, infection, or dural-based neoplasms. The DSM-5 criteria for Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition include prominent delusions that are the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The diversity in symptoms is correlated with increased ICP caused primarily by the ruptured bridging veins. Traditional management of CSDH has been trephination, however, nonsurgical options are available including high-dose corticosteroids to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels thereby reducing mortality. Recurrence is possible and may constitute surgical obliteration of the subdural space.Chronic subdural hematoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new-onset psychosis, particularly in patients with other risk factors. A thorough history and physical are vital to ascertain this diagnosis and noncontrast head imaging is confirmatory. Management varies based on the etiology of the CSDH.No funding.",

      "title": "Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) delirium: A “psychosomatic” problem?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) delirium is a common complication after major surgery and related among other potential medical precipitants to either pre-existing cognitive impairment or the intensity and length of anesthesiology or the type of surgery. Nevertheless, in some rare situations, an organic etiology is not always found, which can be frustrating for the medical team. Some clinicians working in an intensive care unit have a reluctance to seek another hypothesis in the psychological field. Method: To illustrate this, we report the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed a massive delirium during her intensive care unit stay after being operated on for a left retroperitoneal sarcoma. Interestingly, she had had no previous cognitive disorders and a somatic explanation for her psychiatric disorder could not been found. Just before the surgery, she was grieving the recent loss of a colleague of the same age, and also a close friend, and therefore had a death anxiety. Results: With this case report, we would like to point out the importance of psychological factors that might precipitate delirium in a predominately somatic environment such as an intensive care unit. Significance of results: ICU delirium can sometimes be considered as a “psychosomatic” problem with either a stress response syndrome after surgery or a defense mechanism against death anxiety. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of such psychological factors even if they always must first rule out potential somatic causes for delirium and encourage thorough investigation and treatment of these medical causes. A collaboration with the psycho-oncologist is recommended to better manage this “psychosomatic” problem.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter highlights the Panic Disorder module in the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5, Child and Parent Version: Child Interview Schedule (CIS). The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Depression and dementia can lead to generalised cognitive and memory dysfunction. Thus, differentiating these disorders is important and challenging. Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

      "abstract": "The Troyer syndrome was found by Cross &amp; McKusick (1967) in 20 members of 12 Old Order Amish families in Holmes County, Ohio; it is a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia combined with distal muscle wasting, i.e. signs of involvement of lower motor neurons. The condition usually begins at 1 to 2 years and progresses at variable rates. Further manifestations include growth retardation, delayed speech development with dysarthria and drooling, and cerebellar signs; mental functions are usually not affected but severe emotional lability is a common finding. Brothers in a Wisconsin Old Order Amish family are reported with spastic diplegia, mental retardation, behavioral disorder and shortness of stature; the condition apparently is not progressive, and may be a “new” syndrome but could also represent a variant of the Troyer syndrome. Autosomal recessive inheritance is most likely, although consanguinity of the parents could not be proven. Another child in this family suffers from focal scleroderma (morphea) which is not related to the neurological syndrome.",

We aim to illustrate that the chronology and phenomenological nature of hallucinatory symptoms may provide clues towards alternative diagnoses, such as hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD). We describe the resurgence of visual pseudo-hallucinations in a young woman in the context of previous substance-induced hallucinatory symptoms and a prior diagnosis of occipital lobe epilepsy. She presented a diagnostic challenge, saw several emergency and specialist doctors and attracted stigmatising diagnoses leading to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Her symptoms were finally recognised as HPPD, and she was treated appropriately with lamotrigine. Conclusions: Patients with perceptual disturbance can present in various clinical settings, and HPPD is an under-recognised diagnostic possibility. Delayed or misdiagnosis prolongs profound functional impairment and social decline, and predisposes the patient to the development of anxiety and depression and related increased risk of suicide.",

Some are quite common, such as a psychosis is in epilepsy, but many are rare, and sometimes the rarer they are, the more startling and challenging they seem. Take the Moebius syndrome. This is an unusual condition in which there is a congenital palsy of some cranial nerves—most notably the 6th and 7th—usually with hypoplasia or agenesis of the respective nerve nuclei. For example, the patient I was asked to see, because of unremitting seizures, was a girl in her late teens, who had never had any facial expression. She could not smile or express laughter, she could not look angry, she could not contort her face to tears or grief. But did she feel emotions? Of course. She got angry like the rest of us, teared when sad, and was able laugh. The vocalizations of her affects were all present, she simply could not show emotions. Not surprisingly, this had affected her social development, and inhibited her interactions with her peers. She was frustrated by this inhibition and, in the course of her adolescence, had developed depression and panic attacks, which had been mistakenly diagnosed as epilepsy. This is one variant of the pseudoseizure spectrum.",

It is possible to arrange a list of these conditions, not necessarily complete, under three basic headings for the purpose of description: subcultural defects, instability defects and somatic defects. Subcultural defectives are characterized by intellectual inadequacy paralleled by a lower level of social development; unstable defectives are characterized by abnormal rather than subnormal conduct and may be of the psychopathic, the epileptic or the exogenous type.

We would propose a third paradigm of “early intervention”, involving a combination of medical and psychosocial interventions targeted at young, vulnerable people with the aim of preventing or limiting likely social, psychological and mental deterioration. Vigorous intervention early in the course of illness, early recognition and treatment of relapse and the promotion of psychological adjustment to psychotic illness are proposed as key elements of this third paradigm.",

      "title": "Children with strabismus: Is there psychological impact on mothers?",
      "abstract": "Sir, Strabismus is a common childhood disorder having a global prevalence of approximately 2.1%–3%.[1] The exact etiology remains unknown and it is believed to have a multifactorial origin. Risk factors for developing strabismus include maternal smoking during pregnancy, premature infants with retinopathy of prematurity, low birthweight, and family history of strabismus.[1] Strabismus can have profound consequences for the child and his/her parent with a negative psychosocial impact beginning to effect children as early as 4 years of age. If left uncorrected, the impact intensifies throughout adolescence and adulthood. Low self-esteem, ostracizing by peers, social isolation, and difficulty in communication are among the main social stigmas associated with the disorder. The affected child is also likely to have poor academic performance.[2] In addition, strabismus can also adversely affect other family members, specifically mothers. It has been observed that mothers of children suffering from facial abnormalities including strabismus and cleft lip and palate commonly have emotional problems or mood disorders. Akay et al. demonstrated higher rates of depression in mothers whose children had strabismus compared with controls.[3] Affected mothers were less likely to be supportive of their children and were less likely to accept their maternal role that led to poor family dynamics.[3] The negative psychosocial impact of strabismus has been demonstrated in various populations. In the Saudi population where mothers tend to be the primary caregivers and spend most of their time with children, there may be a strong psychosocial association with physical child deformity. We performed an observational study at the Prince Abdulaziz Bin Musaad Hospital, Saudi Arabia, from July to September 2016. Mothers accompanying children aged 3–16 years who presented with manifest horizontal strabismus at the outpatient ophthalmology consulting clinics were included in the study. Mothers of children with paralytic, restrictive, or vertical squints, neurological deficits associated with nystagmus, and other cosmetic abnormalities were excluded. Mothers with any history of prior or comorbid psychiatric illnesses, including drug dependence, were also excluded from the study. A standardized Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale was administered as a screening tool for depression to mothers included in the study.[4] The HAD Scale consists of seven screening questions each for depression or anxiety (total = 14). Each question had predetermined responses that can be graded from 0 to 3 with a score of 3 demonstrating the highest likelihood of anxiety or depression. The questionnaire records responses related to the general mood of the responder during 1 week prior to the visit. A total of 25 mothers were interviewed during the study period and their mean age was 35 ± 3.8 years. The mean scores for anxiety and depression on the HAD questionnaire were 2.05 ± 1.37 and 2.84 ± 1.28, respectively. Qualitatively, the participants demonstrated overall good affect, and majority (72%) were not distressed by their child's strabismus. The participants demonstrated general awareness of their child's condition and an active interest in the prospective treatment. On general discussion with the parents, they understood the physical ophthalmological manifestations and its common presentation in children of that age group. They were also aware of the options available for correctional management and their high success rates. Almost all parents had learned this information from reviewing the topic on the Internet or had informally consulted a doctor in the family. The mean scores of anxiety and depression in our study were 2.05 ± 1.37 and 2.84 ± 1.28, respectively, according to the HAD Scale. A score of 0–7 is considered negative for both anxiety and depression and does not warrant further exploration of mood disorders. According to our results, we did not find any participant to lie in the borderline (8–10) or abnormal (11–21) criteria according to the questionnaire scores. This demonstrated the absence of any psychological distress or disorder among mothers of affected children. The mean scores for both anxiety and depression were below the threshold required for a positive screen. The results of our study are in contrast to those of Akay et al.[3] In their study, they demonstrated significantly higher depression scores in mothers whose children had strabismus compared to controls; however, their study was conducted on patients presenting in the years 2000–2002. The ease of access to medical knowledge on the Internet has improved significantly during this decade. Global access to the Internet and media has resulted in wide dissemination of medical information (diagnosis, management, and prognosis) and a higher rate of awareness about prognosis of ophthalmological disorders.[5] The literature demonstrates that parents try to attain all possible information about a pediatric disorder before actually selecting a care provider and visiting the doctor.[6] Concerned parents have the opportunity to learn more about pediatric ophthalmological disorders affecting children including strabismus prior to their visit with the doctor. Adequate awareness about pediatric ophthalmological manifestations may provide reassurance to mothers and help alleviate the associated anxiety. Our study was limited due to the small sample size and a lack of control group; however, in an observational capacity, it demonstrated interesting results that need to be studied in further detail.

      "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

      "title": "Impaired Mental Proprioception in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Psychiatrists recognize that schizophrenia is a disorder in which the highest mental functions, such as thought, language, emotions, conation, and cognition, are drastically disrupted. However, the most serious impairment in schizophrenia is a global malfunction in self-integration and personal identity that includes a deficit in self-recognition. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This distorted sense of leads persons with schizophrenia to fail to recognize what is or is not part of their own mind, which can produce clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, including bizarre delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder, social deficits, and information processing. (1) Just as intact physical proprioception enables a healthy person to be continuously aware of where his body and its parts are located in space, allowing sensory-motor integration, mental proprioception enables one to be fully aware of his identity and self-boundaries, and that his thoughts and actions are generated from within his own sphere of consciousness, not from an external source. In schizophrenia, the coherent sense of is shattered and fragmented, a frightening experience patients describe after emerging from psychosis. (2) A person affected by schizophrenia feels lost, as if his no longer belong[s] to him. He feels alienated from his real self and refers to himself in the third person. He feels disconnected, disintegrated, and diminished, with a sense of emptiness, a painful void of existence, of being disembodied with no clear demarcation between and others. (2) Not surprisingly, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptual aberrations (hallucinations) emerge from a fragmented sense of self. Patients fail to recognize that their actions, thoughts, or feelings are initiated from within the self, leading to delusions of passivity and being controlled by an outside force. One's impulses are misperceived as being imposed by an alien. One's thoughts, fantasies, and memories become external hallucinations instead of internal recollections. It is not surprising that depersonalization and derealization are common in schizophrenia and in the prodrome stage. Phencyclidine and ketamine, which can produce schizophrenia-like psychoses, are known to trigger dissociative phenomena and a loss of a coherent sense of self. What causes the disintegration of the mind (self) in schizophrenia? The leading neurobiologic explanation is well-documented white matter pathology. (3) Numerous studies have demonstrated that the myelinated axons and fibers that connect various brain regions are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia. The evidence for the breakdown of white matter--and, consequently, brain connectedness and integration--includes several lines of evidence, such as: a) in vivo neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that show abnormal water mobility in the myelin; b) genetic aberrations in myelin genes; c) postmortem evidence of reduced oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that manufacture myelin; and d) biochemical markers such as the calcium-binding protein S100B, which is released by compromised glial cells. (3) Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the disruption of the sense of and its proprioception may be due to the extensive disconnectivity of brain regions caused by myelin pathology. (4) However, grey matter abnormality also may play a role in loss of mental proprioceptive functions, which causes a failure to properly recognize one's self. The inferior parietal cortex, which controls body image, concept of self, sensory integration, and executive function, has been reported to be structurally impaired in patients with schizophrenia. …",

      "title": "The positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia reflect impairments in the perception and initiation of action",
      "abstract": "Synopsis The CNS maintains a fundamental distinction between actions elicited by external stimuli and actions elicited by internal goals (acts of will). As a result the intact organism can monitor centrally three aspects of its own actions: (1) the action appropriate to current external stimulation (stimulus intention or meaning); (2) the action appropriate to current goals (willed intention); and (3) the action which was actually selected (corollary discharge). In Type I (acute) schizophrenic patients, intentions of will lead to actions, but these willed intentions are not monitored correctly. This apparent discrepancy between will and action gives rise to experiential (1st rank) positive symptoms (e.g. delusions of control and passivity). In Type II (chronic) patients, intentions of will are no longer properly formed and so actions are rarely elicited via this route. This gives rise to behavioural negative signs (e.g. poverty of speech). The behaviour of Type II schizophrenics has surface similarities to that shown by patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal lobe lesions in that all three types of patient show a relative deficit of actions elicited by willed intentions. Dopamine blocking drugs reduce positive symptoms in Type I patients precisely because they induce Parkinsonism, i.e. reduce the likelihood of actions being initiated by willed intentions. This in turn reduces the likelihood that actions will occur for which the patient had no awareness of his intention to act.",

      "abstract": "The experience of intense painful aloneness is a common event in the lives of borderline patients, especially those closer to the psychotic spectrum. This experience is defined as an intrinsic aspect of the borderline personality defect and consists of a relative or total inability to remember positive images or fantasies of sustaining people in the patient's present or past life, or being overwhelmed by negative memories and images of these people. The development of borderline aloneness is related to a possible developmental failure, defined by Piaget, Fraiberg, and A.-M. Sandler. These workers describe the child's development of object permanence and evocative memory capacity (Piaget's sensori-motor stage VI). We postulate that a major borderline vulnerability is the tenuous achievement of the capacity for affective object permanence and its regressive loss to recognition memory or earlier when under specific stresses. We relate our hypotheses to possible empathic parental failures during the substages of separation-individuation, especially the rapprochement sub-phase. The treatment implications of our formulations are discussed, with an emphasis on the clarification of the need for the therapist's availability and the use of transitional objects during times of the patient's loss of his affective cognitive capacities. These regressive experiences often emerge as a core transference manifestation during psychoanalytic therapy with borderline patients, and often become the basis of significant therapeutic work.",

      "title": "Assessment of Executive Function for Schizophrenia in Hong Kong",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patients with schizophrenia have been found to exhibit a cluster of symptoms collectively known as dysexecutive syndrome. However, neuropsychological studies of dysexecutive syndrome and their corresponding assessments are inherently difficult. Published studies of dysexecutive syndrome have predominantly considered English-speaking populations and, almost invariably, western cultural groups. As a consequence, the majority of assessment measures and checklists are standardised in English. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current issues in the assessment of executive functions for schizophrenia in clinical practice in Hong Kong. Key words: Hong Kong, Needs assessment, Schizophrenia Introduction Schizophrenia is associated with a wide range of cognitive impairments, including attention, memory, and executive functions, as well as a general decline in intellectual functioning. (1,2) In particular, patients with schizophrenia have been found to exhibit a cluster of symptoms collectively known as dysexecutive syndrome. (3) Dysexecutive syndrome may have a range of effects on activities of daily life, including the ability to work or attend school, function responsibly in the home, or have appropriate social relationships. (4-6) Green et al found that deficits in executive functions in patients with schizophrenia ultimately determine the functional outcomes in terms of poor community living skills, self-care activities, social problem-solving skills, and psychosocial skills. (7,8) Neuropsychological studies of dysexecutive syndrome and its rehabilitation face inherent difficulties. One of the main critiques is the assessment of executive functions. Executive functions are thought to comprise a series of abilities to achieve a goal. (9,10) Therefore, failure to accomplish executive function tests may be due to several reasons because damage may occur to any component of the process following the onset of schizophrenia or a brain lesion. A further difficulty lies in the apparent fractionation of dysexecutive syndrome, (11,12) meaning that a patient's performance in 1 frontal lobe test may have little or no predictive value for how they may perform in another test, let alone in a complex real-world situation. To address this problem, there is an increasing emphasis on incorporating more complex multifaceted life-like challenges within performance measures; in other words tasks that will tap a number of executive domains at the same time. (13-15) However, behaviour in real-life must always remain the ultimate test for the clinician. Published studies of dysexecutive syndrome have predominantly considered English-speaking populations and, almost invariably, western cultural groups. As a consequence, the majority of assessment measures and checklists are standardised in English. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issues relating to the assessment of executive functions in local clinical practice. In particular, the focus will be on the Supervisory Attentional System. (9,16) This theory assumes that the processes involved in the cognitive control of action and thought can be divided into 2 systems: contention scheduling and a supervisory attentional system. Contention scheduling is responsible for routine learned behaviour and performance of everyday tasks. Contention scheduling enables prioritisation of the order of simultaneously competing tasks or routine activities such as making a cup of coffee when a telephone rings. The supervisory attention system is responsible for regulating non-routine and novel tasks. There are 5 types of situations where routine automatic activation of behaviour would not be sufficient for optimal performance: situations involving planning or decision-making; situations involving error correction or troubleshooting; situations where responses are not well-learned or contain novel sequences of actions; dangerous or technically difficult situations; and situations that require a strong habitual response to be overcome or a temptation to be resisted. …",

ADHD is a life long disorder associated with executive functioning and cognitive deficits, and is a risk factor for comorbid psychiatric conditions such as depression and substance abuse. Prevalence rates for ADHD are affected by age and gender. The clinical presentation of ADHD consists of two dimensions: inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity, or a combination of both. The clinical expression of hyperactivity and impulsivity varies with the child's developmental level and often diminishes in adulthood. Children with ADHD present with cognitive impairments that are apparent at an early age, often before they attend school. The clinical characteristics of increased motor activity, irritability, hostility, and impulsivity or distractibility overlap for ADHD and Bipolar Disorder. Cognitive-behavioral skills therapy can teach individuals with ADHD self-monitoring and more adaptive coping skills.",

SCD is defined as a primary deficit in the social use of nonverbal and verbal communication. SCD has very much in common with pragmatic language impairment, which is characterized by difficulties in understanding and using language in context and following the social rules of language, despite relative strengths in word knowledge and grammar. SCD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are similar in that they both involve deficits in social communication skills, however individuals with SCD do not demonstrate restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, insistence on sameness, or sensory abnormalities. It is essential to rule out a diagnosis of ASD by verifying the lack of these additional symptoms, current or past. The criteria for SCD are qualitatively different from those of ASD and are not equivalent to those of mild ASD. It is clinically important that SCD should be differentiated from high-functioning ASD (such as Asperger syndrome) and nonverbal learning disabilities. The ultimate goals are the refinement of the conceptualization, development and validation of assessment tools and interventions, and obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the shared and unique etiologic factors for SCD in relation to those of other neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Hypochondriasis can be a part of another syndrome, usually an affective one, or it can be a primary disorder. The prevalence differs between cultures and social classes. Constitutional factors, disease in the family in childhood, and previous disease predispose to hypochondriasis. Various stressors can be precipitating events. Selective perception of symptoms, motivated by fear of disease, and subsequent increase in anxiety with more somatic symptoms appear to be links in the vicious cycle of the hypochondriacal reaction. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, and the recommended treatments are based on studies with similar disorders.

Serious intrafamilial childhood abuse can lead not only to the classic post-traumatic stress syndrome, but can influence all aspects of personality development, including the distortion of the sense of identity, self-regulation, and the patterns of interpersonal relations. Viewed from the perspective of the trauma concept, the entire range of adult borderline symptoms are considered as being the consequences of severe complex traumatic experiences.

      "title": "Bipolar Affective Disorder: Severe Episodes of Depression Now with Psychotic Symptoms Accompanied by Threshold Type Personality Disorder and Suicide Attempts",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric disorder that falls into the category of mood disorders. Personality disorder is a pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates from culture, and is pervasive and inflexible. Individuals with Body Dysmorphic Disorder have a significant increase in the likelihood of developing depression According to WHO, patients with borderline personality disorder are estimated to have about 73% of patients will have about 3 suicide attempts in their lifetime, while patients with bipolar disorder have a higher risk of suicide compared to the general population Case report: This paper includes a case analysis of an 18-year-old boy who was in the middle of a experiencing self-injurious behavior accompanied by depressive symptoms, and suicide attempts. The patient's history of significant emotional trauma, including bullying, and family conflicts. Patients show symptoms in people with BPD, such as impulsive behavior, identity crisis, and extreme mood swings. The diagnosis in patients is that there is bipolar affective disorder, episodes of severe depression with psychotic symptoms accompanied by borderline type personality disorder and suicide attempts, then there are problems in the primary support group (family) and the Global Assessment of Functional (GAF) Scale of patients 20-11. Manajemen yang diberikan pada pasien ini adalah kombinasi farmakoterapi berupa Escitalopram dan Aripriprazole. Serta pasien diberikan terapi perilaku kognitif (cognitive behavioral therapy). Conclusion: The case of bipolar affective disorder is a mood disorder characterized by depressive and manic or hypomanic episodes. The patient in this case was experiencing bipolar affective disorder with a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms. In patients, there is a disorder on axis II, which is in the form of a threshold type personality. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) involves significant affective lability and carries a great risk for depression. Threshold type disorder, characterized by emotional instability, impulsivity and depressive disorders such as depressive affect, loss of interest and lack of energy so that it is easy to get tired. Based on suicide risk factors, patients have experienced physical and sexual abuse, patients are also victims of bullying and patients have conflicts in the family. The management provided is in the form of a combination of pharmacotherapy, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants to reduce depressive and psychotic symptoms, as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy.",

      "abstract": "Early infantile autism is the most severe of a group of neurodevelopmental syndromes called the pervasive developmental disorders. The clinical features of autism vary greatly, but, by definition, include deficits in social relatedness, communication, and interests or routines. The onset of autistic signs and behaviors typ ically occurs in infancy, and the syndrome is usually fully present by the fourth year. The presence of mental retardation affects the clinical picture greatly. Severely autistic children may be retarded and mute and are often preoccupied with repetitive activities; they often exhibit motor stereotypes, such as rocking or hand flapping. They can be profoundly withdrawn and may show extreme aversion to social or physical contact. More mildly affected children may have normal or even superior intelligence, with well-developed language skills. Their deficits in social relatedness and preoccupation with rituals and routines may set them apart as very odd, but not necessarily as autistic. Autism occurs in 1 of 2000 live births; boys outnumber girls about 3 or 4:1. Although there are no localizing neurological signs in autism, mild or \"soft\" neurological signs are common and grand mal seizures are frequently present after puberty (Lotspeich LJ, Ciaranello RD.

      "abstract": "Down syndrome is the most common genetic disorder that results from the excess of one chromosome or part of a chromosome in the nucleus of each cell of the body. This disorder significantly characterizes the development of the child in all areas. It affects all racial groups and can occur in any family, regardless of parental health, economic situation or lifestyle. Because it limits a child's mental development, intellectual disabilities are primary in people with Down Syndrome.\r\n Intellectual disabilities are a complex occurrence of a condition that is defined as a significant limitation in an individual's development, and is determined before the age of 18. It is characterized by below-average intellectual functioning and a reduced level of adaptive skills. Difficulties can manifest as different deviations on the motor, cognitive, emotional and social plan. In this context, there is a need to implement various therapeutic interventions within which expressive arts therapies may represent one of the appropriate complementary therapeutic methods.\r\n Expressive arts-therapies refer to the application of various art-media such as music, visual arts, movement and dance, drama, poetry, and related approaches such as psychodrama, guided imagination, relaxation, etc., with the aim of stimulating emotional, cognitive, social and the physical integration of the individual. The use of expressive arts-therapies may be useful as complementary therapy in conditions where certain physical, intellectual or sensory limitations inhibit the realization of emotional or social needs. Given that this type of therapeutic approach works to improve functional abilities, gain new insights into one's emotional experience, needs, goals and strategies, and to encourage social interactions, it can contribute to subjective, emotional, spiritual and psychosocial well-being and thus improving the quality of life of people with intellectual disabilities.\r\n 7\r\n In this regard, the aim of this paper is defined to review the current findings on the impact of expressive arts-therapies on various aspects of functioning in individuals with Down syndrome. Considering the lack of available literature in the defined problem area, this paper also covers related research on the impact of expressive arts-therapies in people with intellectual disabilities caused by different etiology.\r\n Although the results of the some researches indicated positive effects in the field of psychomotor, emotional and social functioning, there is also a need for further research focused on the conceptualization of therapeutic programs as well as on the development of an evaluation system, where particular emphasis should be placed on defining appropriate assessment instruments and parameters. This would have a positive impact on the prospect of future use of expressive arts-therapies, as part of a holistic and interdisciplinary approach, in the rehabilitation of persons with Down syndrome.",

Many etiologies were proposed for selective mutism including psychodynamic, behavioral and familial etc. A developmental etiology that includes insights from all the above is gaining support. Accordingly, mild language impairment in a child with an anxiety trait may be at the root of developing selective mutism. The behavior will be reinforced by an avoidant pattern in the family. Early treatment and followup for children with selective mutism is important. The treatment includes non-pharmacological therapy (psychodynamic, behavioral and familial) and pharmacologic therapy--mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).",

      "abstract": "Introduction Anomalies of bodily experience have for long been described as relevant features of schizophrenia and major depression, yet such experiences are usually neglected in clinical examination. Bodily experience is the implicit background of our experiences against which we develop a coherent sense of self as a unified, bounded entity, naturally immersed in a social world of meaningful others. Such tacit experiential background is often perturbed in schizophrenia and major depression. Empirical research shows that patients with schizophrenia and major depression frequently present many different kinds of anomalies of bodily experience in the course of their illness. Objective To characterize the abnormal bodily phenomena in both schizophrenia and major depression. Aim To improve differential diagnosis based on the identification of typical features of abnormal bodily experiences in persons affected by schizophrenia and major depression and to provide supplementary diagnostic criteria. Method Analysis of empirical and theoretical research published in the last 25 years. Result Ongoing bodily feelings of disintegration/violation and nothingness/mechanization (e.g. one's body experienced as a object-like mechanism) are the most typical experiences in people with schizophrenia whereas major depressives are not able to detach themselves from the experience of bodily failure or chrematization (from chrema = corpse, i.e., feeling like a corpse) and therefore, feel worthless, guilty, or decaying. They feel chrematized in their very self. Conclusion These experiences might be considered as specific and they can contribute to differential diagnosis of somatic complaints in schizophrenia and in major depression.

      "abstract": "Passivity phenomena range among the prominent core symptoms of schizophrenia and include thought insertion and blockade (APA 1994 2013; WHO 2011). In the German psychopathological tradition, Kurt Schneider (1942) called those phenomena \"ego disorders\" and emphasized their status as criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. He insisted that such symptoms, which are reported by the patients themselves, are much more reliable signs of a schizophrenic psychosis compared to symptoms based on clinical impression, such as thought incoherence or flat affect. Indeed, prejudices and personal experiences of any examiner can substantially interfere with his or her judgment of \"coherent\" speech or the \"depth\" of any affective experience of a patient, while symptoms articulated by the patients themselves are supposed to reflect their own experiences, at least to the degree to which psychotic, unusual experiences can be translated into any common language. Schneider (1942) had named such symptoms \"firstrank symptoms\" of schizophrenia, and he assumed that they should guide clinical diagnosis. In a time when the diagnosis of schizophrenia meant that the patient would be sterilized against his or her will or even secretly murdered, Schneider thus suggested limiting the diagnosis of schizophrenia to patients who actively report core symptoms; while quite far from active resistance against Nazi atrocities, his call for \"modesty\" in diagnosing schizophrenia still resonates with a public that criticizes excessive diagnoses and pathologization of everyday human experiences.",

We addressed two fundamental, unresolved issues regarding the transdiagnostic nature of this dysfunction. First, we examined the relationship of deficits in emotional clarity to seven symptom types, accounting for possible confounding effects of overlapping symptoms. We found that deficits in emotional clarity were associated with symptoms of depression, social anxiety, borderline personality, binge eating, and alcohol use, but not anxious arousal or restrictive eating. Second, we tested whether deficits in emotional clarity would relate to psychopathology by way of impaired emotion regulation. Notably, the relationship between deficits in emotional clarity and each symptom type was mediated by a distinct, disorderspecific pattern of emotion regulation deficits. Findings suggest that deficits in emotional clarity can be conceptualized as a transdiagnostic process with diverging mechanisms involving emotion regulation difficulties that vary from disorder to disorder. We discuss these findings within a contextual approach to delineating transdiagnostic processes.",

Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa. The impact of early childhood events in particular may have the long-lasting effects,especially if epigenetic changes are involved.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of learning disabilities",
      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous diagnostic category. As a specific disorder learning disabilities include reading disorders, disorders of written expression and mathematics disorders. As a general concept, learning disabilities may be categorised into four symptom complexes, which are not mutually exclusive: 1. dyslexia, 2. motor-perceptual; 3. language delay; 4. hyperactivity. In clinical settings these neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed in school-aged children. The most common referral reasons are significant difficulties in school achievement or difficulties in child adjustment and functioning that are manifested through behavioural and emotional difficulties caused by learning disabilities. Since academic achievement is an important aspect of self-esteem in childhood, school failure may result in many short-term and long-term consequences for the child’s functioning in narrow and broader social contexts, development of maladaptive behaviour and also cause the development of psychopathology. The most common short-term consequences include low academic and general self-esteem, lack of motivation for schooling and related obligations, behavioural disorders, a sense of overload in the child, peer relationship problems and a heightened level of family conflicts. The usual long-term outcomes are psychosomatic problems, affective disorders (depression, anxiety) and severe behavioural problems. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show the persistence of certain problems in adulthood.In summary, impairments should be adequately assessed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and strengths, and a precise diagnosis should be established. Once problem areas have been identified, special teaching strategies can be devised in collaboration with the school to circumvent handicaps. Also, an important part of intervention includes counselling of parents and children.",

The poor response to psychological treatments is noteworthy and organic features, of a specific type, have been implicated. The most recent evidence strongly supports earlier findings of a genetic factor. Damage or malfunction of the left temporal lobe of the brain, or of the frontal area, are associated with violent psychopathic behaviour. Dysfunction in these same areas has also been found in schizophrenic patients and there is a genetic relationship between psychopathy and schizophrenia. It is concluded that organic factors probably underpin some psychopathic behaviour, a situation which may affect our attitudes.",

Having a relatively early postpartum onset within 4-12 weeks, this pathology may have psychological, social and family repercussions in the long term, both on mother and father, but especially on the child. Postpartum depression is a relatively frequent psychiatric pathology involving some challenges in managing and treating the case due to the increased risk of suicide and infanticide. Having a relatively early postpartum onset within 4-12 weeks, this pathology may have psychological, social and family repercussions in the long term, both on the mother and father, but especially on the child. Postpartum depression manifests with symptoms typical of all depressive episodes, such as depressed mood, irritability, low tolerance to frustration, anxiety, hypersomnia, but also more specific symptoms such as feelings and guilty thoughts about correct child development, lack of empathy, lack of maternal behavior. Emotional, socio-cultural and physiological factors play an important role in the onset of this symptomatology. Postpartum depression raises ethical concerns about the proper conduct of the doctor. In this article we will address both deontological aspects such as doctor-patient confidentiality, suicide and infanticide, as well as the legal aspects that may occur in such situations. Thus, postpartum depression is a therapeutic challenge because of the multiple social, family and legal interferences it presents.",

      "abstract": "Robust evidence has accumulated showing that individuals who develop schizophrenia are at elevated risk when compared to the general population to engage in violence towards others. This violence impacts negatively on victims as well as perpetrators and poses a significant financial burden to society. It is posited that among violent offenders with schizophrenia there are three distinct types defined by the age of onset of antisocial and violent behaviour. The early starters display a pattern of antisocial behaviour that emerges in childhood or early adolescence, well before illness onset, and that remains stable across the lifespan. The largest group of violent offenders with schizophrenia show no antisocial behaviour prior to the onset of the illness and then repeatedly engage in aggressive behaviour towards others. A small group of individuals who display a chronic course of schizophrenia show no aggressive behaviour for one or two decades after illness onset and then engage in serious violence, often killing, those who care for them. We hypothesize that both the developmental processes and the proximal factors, such as symptoms of psychosis and drug misuse, associated with violent behaviour differ for the three types of offenders with schizophrenia, as do their needs for treatment.",

      "title": "Schizophrenic Syndromes in Epilepsies (Part 4 of 7)",
      "abstract": "Following a historical review and critical appraisal of the literature (problems of definition, selection, frequency, etiology, relation and classification) clinical findings from a series of retrospective and prospective studies (four samples with altogether 47 epileptic patients) are presented and discussed, as well as the results of EEG, CT and other relevant investigations. (1) 'Schizophrenia-like' interictal (periictal) psychoses in the epilepsies, which are not rare, appear to be true schizophreniform (= schizophrenic-accentuated) syndromes in a setting of 'clear' consciousness. There is no case of alternative psychosis and EEG 'forced normalization'. (2) Between schizophrenic-accentuated syndromes associated with regularly symptomatic epilepsies and genuine (endogeneous) schizophrenias, there are quantitative but no qualitative differences. Often there is a congruence and no possibility of differentiating in the transverse study. This is also true both for the affective and the cognitive disturbances ('structure of consciousness'); the latter are not suitable for separating the psychopathological syndromes of epilepsies. A discrimination between 'genuine' and 'symptomatic' schizophrenia is no longer meaningful. (3) A true (hereditary) coincidence of (genuine) epilepsy and schizophrenia occurs obviously very seldom. (4) Numerous findings are presented, concerning the conditions in which schizophrenic-accentuated syndromes appear. The following relevant factors are discussed: hereditary, latency, duration of illness, type and frequency of seizures, type and localization of EEG foci, type, extent and topography of brain lesions, quantity and quality of psychopathological findings as well as 'organic' psychosyndromes. The possible triggering of psychoses by psychosocial factors, low intelligence, chronic folate deficiency and other specific risk factors and the role of neurotransmitter disorders (GABA hypotheses) are discussed. Finally proposals are made concerning prevention and therapy. Especially often diagnosed non-alternative schizophrenic syndromes in epileptic patients must be controlled by blood levels of antiepileptics. There is a transitional rank, constituted by defined determinants between the poles epilepsy and schizophrenia or a converging course of those syndromes. The results should lead to more frequent EEG and CT eventual magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography-investigations in schizophrenic patients.",

Sometimes this can be the effect of a massive personality disorder, which so badly affects nonverbal communication that all speech is made impossible. With other children, this may not be the case, even with those who seem to be taking refuge in prostration, uncontrolled agitation, or weird rituals. When I met Ahlem for the first time, she appeared to be particularly listless, though her psychological difficulties were no more severe than neurosis. Her withdrawal was so profound because it was the result of a confluence of cognitive and aphasiological problems. In fact, she was not completely averse to all contact; once she had gained a little confidence in her own actions, her development toward speech took a normal course. However, as things improved, her difficulties became more pointed, and certain events, which were initially inexplicable, took on a new and remarkable significance.",

By the definition, it is the fear of witnessing the negative judgement and the criticism of other people, which is so intense that, is followed by reactions of avoidance of phobic situations and doings, followed by intense vegetative symptoms. Aim Introduce social phobia as an important social and medical problem with common co-morbidity and exceptional risk of suicide. At the same time it gives special accent to the diagnostic procedures and differential diagnosis. Method Analysis of the information from literature and practice and coming to conclusions with the inductive method. Results Social phobia is a chronicle illness, equally present in both sexes. The central position is taken by all-the-time present intense irrational fear. Alcoholism, misuse of sedatives, depression, and panic with agoraphobia, OCD are common followers of social phobia. Differential diagnosis witch eliminates panic with agoraphobia, or just the lack of social skills allows the right therapeutic approach. Conclusion Social phobia, alone or combined with other disorders, has a huge medical and social value. Coming back to regular life tracks depends on the right diagnosis and the right time to go into the healing process.

This is because under DSM III-R and IV, the classification requires a six month duration of the prodromal, active (presence of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior), and/ or residual phases of the illness. For first-episode or first-admission patients, the follow-up itself often clarifies the diagnosis. Thus, to minimize misclassification, it would be critical to include in the sample patients who either present with, or have for the potential for developing, schizophrenia, e.g., true-positive and false-negative cases.",

      "abstract": "Background FOXP1 syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with complex clinical presentations including global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual disability, speech and language impairment, autism traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a range of behavioral challenges.. To date, much of the literature focuses on childhood symptoms and little is known about the FOXP1 syndrome phenotype in adolescence or adulthood. Methods A series of caregiver interviews and standardized questionnaires assessed psychiatric and behavioral features of 20 adolescents and adults with FOXP1 syndrome. Interviews captured change in various psychiatric manifestations over time. Medication, social, educational, and vocational history was collected and visual analog scales measured top caregiver concerns during childhood and adolescence/adulthood. Results Anxiety and externalizing behaviors were common in this cohort and psychiatric features, such as psychosis or bipolar symptoms, were present in two participants. There was no reported regression or loss of skills, early in development or during adolescence/adulthood. Caregivers reported continued development in adaptive skills even into adolescence/adulthood. Medication use was common particularly for features of ADHD, although multiple trials were required for some participants to achieve benefit. Standardized assessments accurately picked up on externalizing symptoms and were less sensitive to internalizing symptoms. Educational setting varied up until late elementary school and gradually shifted to special education. Cognitive and developmental concerns were reported as primary during childhood and independence/safety and housing concerns became top concerns by adolescence/adulthood. Caregivers reported continued development in adaptive skills even into adulthood. Conclusions Taken together, results are reassuring, with many families reporting their adolescent and adult children continued to gain skills over time, particularly related to increased independence in communication and personal care. There were no reports of developmental regression, neuropsychiatric decompensation or catatonia.",

Psychosis is influenced by environmental factors, including childhood stress, as well as genetic predisposition. People with psychosis are known to have more insecure attachments than the general population, and are particularly more likely to display dismissive attachment styles. Attachment behavior is related to stress-induced CRH secretion, CRH suppression by oxytocin, and dopamine release in the brain. Imbalances of CRH, oxytocin, and dopamine are expected in psychotic patients with unstable attachments, requiring tailored treatment for this condition. Therefore, this review intends to investigate the effects of insecure attachment in individuals with psychosis.",

In women of cyclothymic disposition a delirious mania following childbirth may lead to an increased frequency and an easier tendency to manic-depressive cycling, even though subsequent pregnancies do not occur. 4. The purely delirious types which recover rapidly are individuals who are generally of stable pre-psychotic matrix. However, subsequent attacks of delirium occur in some, which indicate a low threshold to this type of psychosis and to no other. 5.

The symptoms must persist for at least one month. Many children with SM also have excessive shyness, poor eye contact, and fear of embarrassment. Despite the failure to speak, the child’s nonverbal communication ability is typically age appropriate and prosocial nonverbal communication such as nodding or giggling is often observed. Since SM frequently co-occurs with other communication disorders, the assessment should include a hearing and speech and language evaluation. Behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the primary treatments for SM. Medications are most effective when combined with behavioral treatments and may include the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).",

Despite being eminently treatable, it remains largely under-recognised and, therefore, undertreated. The disorder is characterized by a fear of scrutiny by others, with sufferers experiencing excessive anxiety in social and performance situations. This excessive anxiety usually leads to avoidance behaviour that can severely affect normal daily living. With onset commonly occurring during childhood or adolescence, social anxiety disorder may disrupt normal patterns of development of social and personal relationships, often having a long-term impact on emotional stability in social or working life. If left untreated, the course of social anxiety disorder is frequently complicated with comorbid conditions, particularly major depression or substance abuse. This review assesses the size of the clinical problem by evaluating current and lifetime prevalence estimates, age of onset, risk factors and evolution of the clinical course; thereby providing the rationale for early recognition and prompt treatment.",

      "abstract": "Interest in the distinction between positive and negative symptoms has reached a peak in the last decade and has led to research in different fields like phenomenology, ethiopathogenesis, treatment, course and outcome. Which symptoms are considered positive or negative varies across different authors, although there seems to be agreement on a core syndrome. The definition problems can be also found in the rating scales used for measuring positive and negative symptoms. The positive/negative distinction may represent different manifestations of a common underlying process. It also may suggest the existence of different pathophysiologies in schizophrenia. Since both positive and negative symptoms are frequent in schizophrenia, they are most likely not completely independent. The negative/positive syndrome is not sufficient to describe the dimensions of the complex phenomenology of schizophrenia. Among others, a depressive syndrome needs to be integrated. There is much controversy concerning the course of positive and negative symptoms over time. In subacute and chronic patients the negative syndrome seems to be more stable than the positive syndrome. The differentiation between primary and secondary negative symptoms seems to have great relevance to clinical and research aspects. This differentiation is an important factor in the interpretation of neuroleptic trials on negative symptoms. One way of differentiating between direct and indirect drug effects on negative symptoms is to use sophisticated statistical procedures, for example path analysis.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

For a minority, defiance, disruptiveness, and aggression become so severe that they impair other aspects of functioning, compromise relationships, and risk conflict with parents, teachers, and peers. Disruptive behaviours of this kind are among the most common reasons for referral to child mental health services; they are also some of the most challenging to treat. The psychiatric classification systems define two categories of antisocial disorders in childhood: oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), marked by irritability, temper outbursts, disobedience, and negativity; and conduct disorder (CD), characterized by rule-breaking, verbal and physical aggression, lying and stealing, and violation of others’ rights. Both categories are recognized to be heterogenous, and also to shade into one another; especially among boys, the oppositional young child often develops more severe conduct problems or delinquent behaviours as time goes on.",

Phenomenological details of visitor experiences are expected to reflect the functions of deep temporal lobe structures; common details involve cosmic meaningfulness, vestibular experiences, flickering, complex visual sensations and alimentary references. After intense experiences, interictal-like behaviors similar to religious conversions (widening affect, sense of personal, desire to spread the word, concern about Man's destiny) emerge. Normal people who are prone to these experiences show frequent temporal lobe signs and specific personality characteristics that include enhanced creativity, suggestibility, mild hypomania, anxiety, and emotional lability. Learning histories that encourage the use of right temporal lobe functions for the consolidation of memory, such as compartmentalization of beliefs or repression due to early sexual abuse, predispose to intense visitor experiences. The most frequent precipitants are psychological depression, personal (existential) stress and proximal exposure to the focal tectonic strain fields that accompany luminous phenomena. Possible neuropsychological mechanisms are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Although the neurobiological understanding of autism has been increasing exponentially, the diagnosis of autism spectrum conditions still rests entirely on behavioral criteria. Autism is therefore most productively approached using a combination of biological and psychological theory. The triad of behavioral abnormalities in social function, communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests can be explained psychologically by an impaired capacity for empathizing, or modeling the mental states governing the behavior of people, along with a superior capacity for systemizing, or inferring the rules governing the behavior of objects. This empathizing-systemizing theory explains other psychological models such as impairments of executive function or central coherence, and may have a neurobiological basis in abnormally low activity of brain regions subserving social cognition, along with abnormally high activity of regions subserving lower-level, perceptual processing--a pattern that may result from a skewed balance of local versus long-range functional connectivity.",

These disorders can appear without a context of histrionic personality. The evolution of hysterical disorders during life is not well known. First of all, because the nosographic systems are not constant and, secondly, because the disorders themselves can vary when observed at different times. The aging subject is exposed to an increasing symptomatology or conversely, to an improvement due to the waekening of the narcissism. It is also possible that a continuum could be established from hysterical symptoms in the adulthood to delusions or hallucinations in the elderly. The relation with the old hysteric subject must be marked by empathy and by the conviction that improvement will only lead back to a basal symptomatology.",

One might argue that the seven eponymous syndromes of the DSM (Alzheimer's, Asperger's, Creutzfeld-Jakob's, Huntington's, Pick's, Rett's, and Gilles de la Tourette's) require a bit of study before their nature is clarified, but all the others either stem from common English roots (gambling, binge-eating, sleep disorder) or are decipherable from their Greek or Latin origins (trichotillomania: pathological pulling of hair; insomnia: absence of sleep, etc.). Borderline, when used adjectivally, suggests something that is in close proximity to something else. Indeed, in its first uses in psychiatry, borderline designated either (a) a condition that approximated another, already well-established disorder, or (b) a condition that occupied a region in between two rather indistinctly boundaried levels of mental functioning. As we shall see, the borderline of our current BPD is derived from both these usages.",

      "title": "Pathways to Motivational Impairments in Psychopathology: Common Versus Unique Elements Across Domains",
      "abstract": "Our ability as humans to engage in goal-directed actions that allow us to obtain outcomes that we desire is a core component of life satisfaction and achievement. Sadly, many forms of mental illness involve impairments in varying facets of motivation that are important contributors to the all too frequent impaired life function and reduced quality of life experienced by such individuals. As such, both the field of psychopathology research broadly and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative have recognized the centrality of examining motivation and incentive processing in psychopathology. This review will focus on the types of motivational impairments seen in disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Some individuals with depression do not engage in occupational, educational, or social behaviors that they might participate in when not depressed and may spend much of their time alone and engaged in very passive activities (sleeping, watching TV, etc.). Similarly, in schizophrenia, motivational impairments can also take the form of reduced efforts to engage in occupational, educational, or social experiences. In this review, we argue that elements of the final common pathway to impairments in motivation in depression and schizophrenia may be shared and are likely to involve deficits in what can be referred to as effort-cost decision-making (ECDM). This hypothesis suggests that a proximal cause of reduced engagement in occupational, educational, and social pursuits in both depression and schizophrenia is a reduced willingness to exert effort to obtain potentially rewarding or positive outcomes. However, we also argue that these ECDM deficits in depression and schizophrenia reflect differing distal mechanisms. More specifically, we argue that ECDM impairments in depression may be strongly related to reductions in hedonic experience of reward and pleasure, while ECDM deficits in schizophrenia may more strongly reflect difficulties with cognitive control and internal representation of future or past events and use of incentive information that is not currently available in the environment.",

With this hypothesis in mind, we studied 44 final phase patients whose main symptom was disordered thinking of the schizophasic type and whose illness was of at least 10 years' standing. The most important finding of this study is that the varied and unspecific initial phase progresses into a highly specific syndrome. The symptoms initially registered include various disorders of thinking in less than one third of patients. In no case did these involve schizophasia. In a second phase symptoms were observed such as paralogism, echolalia, verbigeration, circumstantiality, neologism, hypotonic thinking, perseveration, blocking. The symptoms of schizophasia are only recognizable in a third phase and are highly specific. This enables us to confute the claim that psychiatric syndromes are not clinically specific. The three phases described above also provide evidence for the biological nature of this endogenous psychosis.",

Although dissociative identity disorder (DID) and schizophrenia are usually considered distinct, examples such as that of Jo call this clear diagnostic boundary into question. Another point to consider is that people with DID often have at least one part that might well be considered schizophrenic. Some develop DID not as a result of their autistic spectrum temperament but because of prolonged, repeated, and extreme childhood interpersonal trauma, abuse, and even torture. Those with more complex and severe DID sometimes give the impression of having endured deliberate childhood torture with the intention of creating DID which can function for the benefit of the abusers and their group.",

      "abstract": "Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is considered an obsession with healthy eating, a phenomenon that includes excessive dietary restrictions, which in turn can lead to metabolic dysfunctions. Although the nosological status of this pathology is currently insufficiently determined, ON attracts the interest of mental health specialists due to the possible harmful psychological and biological consequences, its high prevalence in the general population and the difficulty of adequate therapeutic management (low level of insight and lack of evidence-based treatments). Orthorexia nervosa should be distinguished from other mental disorders with which it has a high degree of clinical overlap (obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, restrictive/avoidant eating disorder etc.), but also from “healthy orthorexia” (this being considered part of a lifestyle focused on eliminating foods labeled as “impure”, “toxic” or “artificial”). The analysis of risk factors for ON highlights the importance of several obsessive-compulsive personality traits (perfectionism, rigidity, self-control), executive dysfunctions, internalization of social models (thinness or perfect health, for example), media pressure, parental and social group influences, belonging to certain professional categories (nutritionists, medical students, athletes) or practicing yoga. Several psychometric instruments for measuring the severity of ON have been developed over the last two decades, but they should be used with caution because not all of them have well-established validity. Also, several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed in order to identify the clinical features of orthorexia nervosa and to differentiate these patients from those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorders or nonpathological orthorexic behaviors. Finally, some therapeutic suggestions are presented, mainly psychotherapies, but it should be mentioned that they are based on case studies or on the extrapolation of data from trials dedicated to pathologies considered to be related to orthorexia nervosa. In conclusion, because ON is a nosological entity that has only recently been cornered, there is an urgent need to explore psychometric tools with higher specificity and to find more widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Also, no clear, evidence-based therapeutic recommendations could yet be formulated, because no clinical trial focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with orthorexia nervosa has been conducted.",

However, many socio-demographic, personal, or temperamental variables have been investigated for their causal association with suicide risk, but to date no single factor has clearly demonstrated an association with suicide. The mental disorders most frequently associated with suicide risk include bipolar disorders and major unipolar depression, substance use disorders and schizophrenia. However, anxiety, personality, eating, and trauma-related disorders, as well as organic mental disorders, also contribute to suicidal risk. Moreover, in modern society, the presence of social uncertainty, the changes in family models, the development of social media, and the loss of face-to-face interaction can have an impact on suicide risk, particularly in the younger generation.",

Antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and electroconvulsive therapy have been used empirically in acute treatment. This disorder has faced nosologic challenges and is not yet identified as a diagnostic entity by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Questions remain as to whether cycloid psychosis is a primary psychotic or primary affective disorder, given that its course and episodicity are like that of affective disorders, while its clinical manifestations include prominent psychotic symptoms.

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "abstract": "The term craniofacial anomalies (CFAs) refers to a diverse group of congenital disorders including complex syndromes marked by multiple sutural fusions (e.g., Crouzan's, Treacher Collins, and Aperts syndromes), simple craniosynostoses involving single fusions (e.g., sagittal synostosis), hemifacial microsomia, clefts of the lip and/or palate, and isolated birth marks on the face and neck, such as benign vascular nevi (i.e., port-wine stains). Most children with these disorders experience one or more associated complications including feeding and growth difficulties, oral-dental problems, chronic ear infections, speech and language impairments, and multiple structural and cosmetic surgeries for both visible disfigurement and invisible dysmorphologies (e.g., cleft palate). Any or all of these factors may produce significant stress and conflict for the child and family. Various psychological risk factors have been identified that may compromise the child's psychological adjustment, such as parental guilt or overprotectiveness, stigmatizing social responses to speech impairment or facial disfigurement, and certain neuropsychological limitations (see Barden, 1990; Richman & Eliason, 1993, for reviews of this literature).

      "abstract": "Aims Integral to Bleuler's concept of schizophrenia, anomalous beliefs regarding the self are crucial to maladaptive social functioning. In schizophrenia, a predisposition to unusual bodily experiences, coupled with reduced awareness and increased social isolation, leads to hallucinations and delusions. Proprioceptive hallucinations, a subset of bodily hallucinations, present a challenging diagnosis due to their subjective nature, often resembling genuine bodily perceptions. We present the case of a 42-year-old man with untreated psychotic illness, manifesting perceptual abnormalities in the modality of proprioception. Methods Mr. X was referred to Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP), believing that all his joints were dislocated despite a normal neurological examination, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and blood tests. Pertinently, childhood adversities and a seven-year history of prodromal and schizophrenia symptoms, chronic marijuana usage, potentially triggered by separating from his ex-partner, were present. At assessment, Mr. X recalled a delusional memory from age 5, seemingly heralding the onset of his illness. He displayed thought disorder, poor sleep and lacked insight. Olanzapine titrated to 15mg omni nocte (ON) improved sleep, but insight remained poor. Results This case of rare proprioceptive hallucinations presenting in middle-age underscores the impact of positive schizophrenia symptoms on social impairment, suggesting a link between unusual bodily experiences and social isolation. Proprioception, encompassing joint perceptions, muscle force, and effort, contributes to body image by combining with exteroception. Interactions with others, influenced by our bodily sense, are crucial for adaptive social functioning. The social deafferentation hypothesis posits that loneliness in schizophrenia may heighten susceptibility to bodily aberrations. The psychological formulation and the chronic use of marijuana on Mr. X's psychopathology, although not thoroughly explored, cannot be overstated. Conclusion Proprioception, vital for body image and social interactions, contributes to maladaptive functioning. The potent link between positive schizophrenia symptoms and social impairment needs exploring.",

      "abstract": "Interest in the distinction between positive and negative symptoms has reached a peak in the last decade and has led to research in different fields; like phenomenology, ethiopathogenesis, treatment, course and outcome. Which symptoms are considered positive or negative varies across different authors, although there seems to be agreement on a core syndrome. The definition problems can be also found in the rating scales used for measuring positive and negative symptoms. The positive/negative distinction may represent different manifestations of a common underlying process. It also may suggest the existence of different pathophysiologies in schizophrenia. Since both positive and negative symptoms are frequent in schizophrenia, they are most likely not completely independent. The negative/positive syndrome is not sufficient to describe the dimensions of the complex phenomenology of schizophrenia. Among others, a depressive syndrome needs to be integrated. There is much controversy concerning the course of positive and negative symptoms over time. In subacute and chronic patients the negative syndrome seems to be more stable than the positive syndrome. The differentiation between primary and secondary negative symptoms seems to have great relevance to clinical and research aspects. This differentiation is an important factor in the interpretation of neuroleptic trials on negative symptoms. One way of differentiating between direct and indirect drug effects on negative symptoms is to use sophisticated statistical procedures, for example path analysis.",

Results 33 years-old male, married, degree in economics. Observed in the emergency room for having thoughts dominated by ideas of obsessive content, with a sense of self-reference, associated with recurrent compulsions as cleaning and checking rituals, consequential high levels of hopelessness and a depressive mood, with jeopardized chronobiological rhythms. This clinical condition started seven years before and seriously undermined the patient’s autonomy.

      "title": "Neuroticism is a fundamental domain of personality with enormous public health implications",
      "abstract": "Neuroticism is the trait disposition to experience negative affects, including anger, anxiety, self-consciousness, irritability, emotional instability, and depression1. Persons with elevated levels of neuroticism respond poorly to environmental stress, interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and can experience minor frustrations as hopelessly overwhelming. Neuroticism is one of the more well established and empirically validated personality trait domains, with a substantial body of research to support its heritability, childhood antecedents, temporal stability across the life span, and universal presence1, 2. Neuroticism has enormous public health implications3. It provides a dispositional vulnerability for a wide array of different forms of psychopathology, including anxiety, mood, substance, somatic symptom, and eating disorders1, 4. Many instances of maladaptive substance use are efforts to quell or quash the dismay, anxiousness, dysphoria, and emotional instability of neuroticism. Clinically significant episodes of anxiety and depressed mood states will often represent an interaction of the trait or temperament of neuroticism with a life stressor1. Neuroticism is comparably associated with a wide array of physical maladies, such as cardiac problems, disrupted immune functioning, asthma, atopic eczema, irritable bowel syndrome, and even increased risk for mortality2. The relationship of neuroticism to physical problems is both direct and indirect, in that neuroticism provides a vulnerability for the development of these conditions, as well as a disposition to exaggerate their importance and a failure to respond effectively to their treatment. Neuroticism is also associated with a diminished quality of life, including feelings of ill-will, excessive worry, occupational failure, and marital dissatisfaction5. High levels of neuroticism will contribute to poor work performance due to emotional preoccupation, exhaustion, and distraction. Similar to the duel-edged effect of neuroticism on physical conditions, high levels of neuroticism will result in actual impairment to marital relationships but also subjective feelings of marital dissatisfaction even when there is no objective basis for such feelings, which can though in turn lead to actual spousal frustration and withdrawal. Given the contribution of neuroticism to so many negative life outcomes, it has been recommended that the general population be screened for clinically significant levels of neuroticism during routine medical visits1, 6. Screening in the absence of available treatment would be problematic. However, neuroticism is responsive to pharmacologic intervention1. Pharmacotherapy can and does effectively lower levels of the personality trait of neuroticism. Barlow et al7 have also developed an empirically-validated cognitive-behavioral treatment of neuroticism, called the Unified Protocol (UP). They have suggested that current psychological treatments have become overly specialized, focusing on disorder-specific symptoms. The UP was designed to be transdiagnostic. Recognizing the impact of neuroticism across a diverse array of physical and mental health care concerns, the authors of the UP again note that \"the public-health implications of directly treating and even preventing the development of neuroticism would be substantial\"7. Neuroticism has long been recognized since the beginning of basic science personality research and may even be the first domain of personality that was identified within psychology1. Given its central importance for so many different forms of mental and physical dysfunction, it is not surprising that neuroticism is evident within the predominant models of personality, personality disorder, and psychopathology. Neuroticism is one of the fundamental domains of general personality included within the five-factor model or Big Five2. It is also within the dimensional trait model included in Section III of the DSM-5 for emerging measures and models8. This trait model consists of five broad domains, including negative affectivity (along with detachment, psychoticism, antagonism, and disinhibition). As expressed in the DSM-5, \"these five broad domains are maladaptive variants of the five domains of the extensively validated and replicated personality model known as the 'Big Five' or Five Factor Model of personality\"8. Neuroticism is likewise aligned with the negative affective domain included within the dimensional trait model of personality disorder proposed for the ICD-119. Finally, it is also evident within the transdiagnostic Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institute of Mental Health, as RDoC negative valence encapsulates such constructs as fear, distress, frustration, and perceived loss10. It would be inaccurate to suggest that RDoC negative valence is equivalent to neuroticism, but it is self-evident that they are closely aligned. Currently, there is considerable interest in the general factors of psychopathology, personality disorder, and personality. To the extent that degree of impairment and dysfunction (which largely defines the general factors) is associated with level of distress and dismay, which is quite likely to be the case, we would propose that neuroticism will explain a substantial proportion of the variance in those general factors. In sum, neuroticism is a fundamental domain of personality that has enormous public health implications, impacting a wide array of psychopathological and physical health care concerns. It contributes to the occurrence of many significantly harmful life outcomes, as well as impairing the ability of persons to adequately address them. It has long been recognized as one of the more important and significant domains of personality and is being increasingly recognized as a fundamental domain of personality disorder and psychopathology more generally.

      "abstract": "As discussed in Chapter 1, for many young people, exacerbation of manic or depressive symptoms occurs through a spiral of contributing factors, both biological and psychosocial. Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

Bipolar disorders, particularly \"soft\" forms, share symptoms such as depressive mood, irritability or mood reactivity with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, posing challenges on differential diagnosis. In the present work a case of a woman suffering from cyclothymia is reported, with mood episodes confined in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Case Report. A 42-year-old married Caucasian woman is presented, suffering from mood disorder episodes lasting for 10-12 days each, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and remitting after the beginning of her menses. The mood episodes occurred since the age of 20, in almost every menstrual cycle. The patient described hypomanic symptoms during the first 4-5 days of the luteal phase, reporting irritable mood, pressured speech, increased libido as well as vividness of her perceptions and excessive goal-directed activity. The hypomanic symptoms were followed by irritable and depressive mood, fatigue, hypersomnia, tearfulness, decreased self-esteem and pessimism, lasting for another 6-7 days. The patient also reported migraine and binge-eating episodes during each depressive phase. A full range of examinations, including blood and hormonal tests, yielded normal results. Lamotrigine was titrated at 200 mg/day, with subsequent amelioration of symptoms. The exact relationship between premenstrual dysphoric disorder and other disturbances, which either coexist, or deteriorate premenstrually, or even synchronize with the menstrual cycle, has not been elucidated yet. Studies aiming at a better understanding of this relationship could aid at accurate diagnosis and treatment.",

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

      "title": "TAKING OVER EPILEPSY FROM THE PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST",
      "abstract": "he problems of coping with adolescence are greatly increased by an additional chronic disorder.This is particularly so for those with epilepsy, where there is social stigma and the need for potentially sedative and damaging medication.Epilepsy is the most common neurological condition among patients transferred from paediatric to adult care.Many of the problems encountered in the teenager with epilepsy are shared by those with other chronic disabilities. 1 2 This review considers the paediatric environment that the adolescent is leaving, the rationale for a teenage clinic, and the facets of this which make it a desirable facility. c THE TEENAGER WITH EPILEPSYEven when relatively mild, the impact of epilepsy on the teenager and on other members of the family may be profound.Epilepsy has important differences from other chronic disorders, particularly that the disability is intermittent, and so can be hidden.The perceived need to conceal epilepsy, and concern about seizures occurring in public, can induce great anxiety.The consequences of missing epilepsy, or treating it inappropriately, can be disastrous in terms of impaired education, employment, and driving prospects, unnecessary medication, and diminished self esteem.Perhaps these factors are of greater importance for teenagers than for those in other age groups: c Developing independence is impeded, education is at a critical stage, employment and driving prospects are just being realised, and issues of relationships, contraception, pregnancy, and parenthood are becoming increasingly relevant.c Deviations from peer group norms hold great importance for teenagers: epilepsy can be disastrous for self esteem and self identity.c Social handicaps acquired in childhood and adolescence can remain with the individual even after seizures have been adequately controlled.Complete control achieved before adult social and vocational responsibilities can help to avoid these problems.A relatively aggressive approach to treatment, including early consideration of epilepsy surgery, is therefore justified. THE TEENAGER CLINICTaking over a patient's care offers opportunities to reassess the diagnosis by reviewing the history, and to ensure appropriate investigations are to hand.This is best done in the setting of a specialist teenager epilepsy clinic.Developing teenagers often find paediatric clinics embarrassing and inappropriate.A transitional arrangement offers the benefit of consulting both an adult and a paediatric neurologist, supported by an epilepsy specialist nurse. 3The general principles of a teenager epilepsy consultation are listed in box 1.Two main patient groups are referred to this type of clinic: c Patients presenting with blackouts beginning as teenagers (referred from general or hospital practice) where the main initial issue is diagnosis.c Patients with ongoing and often complex epilepsy from childhood (referred from general paediatrics or paediatric neurology) where the main issue is ongoing management of the epilepsy.The following should be addressed at first contact: c Is the diagnosis of epilepsy correct?c If the diagnosis is epilepsy, which type is it?c Is the current epilepsy management appropriate?c Is there appropriate knowledge and understanding of the condition, its prognosis, and its lifestyle implications?In particular, will the seizures interfere with completion of education, training for a career/job, or qualification for a driving licence, and are there special social circumstances that need to be addressed? IS THE DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY CORRECT?A correct diagnosis is essential for the appropriate management of any patient with blackouts.Despite major advances in the technology for investigating blackouts, the most important investigation remains the taking and re-taking of the clinical history.",

      "title": "Diagnostic guidelines for bipolar depression: a probabilistic approach",
      "abstract": "Objectives: There are currently no accepted diagnostic criteria for bipolar depression for either research or clinical purposes. This paper aimed to develop recommendations for diagnostic criteria for bipolar I depression. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and Medline were undertaken. Results: There are no pathognomonic characteristics of bipolar I depression compared to unipolar depressive disorder. There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

It describes the evidence to support the proposition that there exist sub-types of offenders with schizophrenia who present differing treatment needs and that assessment and treatment of aggressive and antisocial behaviour could be initiated when they emerge. One of the principal symptoms of schizophrenia is positive psychotic symptoms. It is often assumed that these psychotic symptoms 'cause' aggressive behaviour amongst people with schizophrenia.

Excessive stress has the potential to induce unfavorable effects in a variety of higher brain-functions, incurred as side effects to maladaptive responses in the genetically controlled stress-responsive neurosystems eg. in the hypo- thalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis. Childhood traumatic experiences are particularly relevant as stressful experiences are they frequently occur in the early childhood, when susceptibility to external stressors is higher. Childhood abuse has been found in several study as directly associated with suicidal behavior, independently from other psychological or psychopathological risk factors. HPA-axis dysregulation is regarded as an endo- phenotype of depression-, anxiety- and alcohol abuse disorders, commonly found also in suicide behaviors. Various neurobiological alterations, suggesting abnormal HPA-axis activity and reactivity, have also been demonstrated to occur in suicidal behaviors including completed suicides. The HPA axis is a major systemic stress-modulator being mainly controlled by the regulatory corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) gene. An overview will be presented of the role of the HPA axis in suicidal behaviors with a focus on CRHR1 gene. and on interactions with childhood traumatic experiences.",

      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses depression in the context of alcoholism and other substance-use disorders. Independent depression syndrome describes a patient who meets criteria for major depression or dysthymia, and it is clear in the history that the depression is independent of effects of substances. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) introduced substance-induced depression to recognize the existence of syndromes of depression that cannot be established to be independent, but that nonetheless appear to exceed the usual effects of substance intoxication or withdrawal and require clinical attention. A number of other psychiatric disorders e.g. bipolar disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and some other anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality, co-occur with substance-use disorders and may account for some of the association between depression and substance abuse. Chronic medical disorders, especially those producing chronic pain, also need to be considered.",

      "title": "Etiological Theories of Somatoform Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Despite the fact that diagnostic systems and epidemiologists seek to avoid messy issues of etiology in neuropsychiatric disorders, there is considerable interest in the developmental underpinnings of somatization. There is a wide range of opinion regarding the origins of somatization, some of which have been alluded to in the first several chapters. Among psychiatric disorders, however, somatoform disorders are unique. With most DSM diagnostic categories, there is an implicit expectation that the symptoms comprising a given diagnosis have some biological foundation. For example, it is widely believed that depression involves problems with serotonin and norepinephrine availability, and that schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder relate to abnormalities in the dopaminergic system. In somatization, symptoms ‘‘are not fully explained by a general medical condition, by the direct effects of a substance, or by another mental disorder’’ (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. 445). In other words, the symptoms are primarily psychological. The DSM-IV acknowledges that somatoform disorders are not grouped together based on a presumed shared etiology, but rather on the need to rule out medical or substance-use–related factors. In other words, they are diagnoses by exclusion. Perhaps the major problem with diagnoses by exclusion is that this often prolongs or increases the number of contacts with specialists and primary care providers. In somatization, persistent doctor shopping is at the heart of the clinical problem, and the notion that an acceptable diagnosis will be found often seems to be the somatizing patient’s Holy Grail.",

      "abstract": "Personality disorders are defined by a characteristic and enduring pattern of behaviour and inner experience that deviates distinctly from culturally defined norms. Examples include social insecurity or even distrust leading to withdrawal, or patterns of impulsiveness, affective instability or, possibly, self-harm. Personality disorders are distinct from other psychiatric disorders primarily by their enduring character. The prevalence of personality disorders among patients with eating disorders depends on population characteristics. In a specialised outpatient clinic that serves a defined catchment area, nearly one third of patients will fulfill the diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder. Hospitalized patients or patients in more specialised units will surely show a considerably higher prevalence. Several modes of interaction between eating disorders and personality disorders could be hypothesized. The treatment of patients with eating disorder should take into account the subgroup with comorbid personality pathology and evaluation and treatment should be planned accordingly, though this requires time and expertise. The issue should also be acknowledged in primary health care and attention be paid to symptoms of eating disorder also in cases in which symptoms of a personality disorder are more pronounced.",

      "title": "General Paralysis and Crime",
      "abstract": "Before the invasion of established general paralysis there is a prodromal stage, which ranges within wide limits as to its scope and duration. The clinical manifestations are many and various, and are symptomatic of either a rapid, or of a slow and insidious disintegration of the intellectual, moral, and affective life. Of all the prodromata, failure and decay of the moral sense are the most important, and are exemplified by acts of omission and commission against law, order, and propriety. The disease attacks all classes, and as the friends cannot nicely discriminate the changes in character, and are apt to look upon them as temporary aberrations, the disturbance to the social fabric caused by these sporadic displays of moral perversion is not inconsiderable. The nature and extent of the disharmony and distress occasioned by these moral lapses depend largely on the social standing, occupation, and opportunities of the diseased individual, and desolate homes, widespread ruin, and unenviable publicity often follow in the train of the predominant imaginative conceptions. The larger ambition may lead to wild speculation, the bolder schemes to fraud. Sobriety is turned into drunkenness, and sexual excitement may result in rape and acts of indecency. If thwarted or opposed, destructiveness or violence may ensue, but in this direction serious consequences are comparatively seldom associated with the expansive prodromata. The budding paralytic of this type is rarely vindictive; although easily roused to anger, he is easily calmed. Being, in his own estimation, so superior mentally and physically to his fellow-men, he can afford to pity and forgive.",

An investigation of the frequency of secondary depression and its nature in depressed opiate addicts, alcoholics, and schizophrenics was undertaken. Findings show that secondary depression in ambulatory patients with other psychiatric disorders is relatively common. The sociodemographic characteristics of the secondary depressives are consistent with the population from which they derive but differ from primary depressives. The symptom patterns of secondary depressives are similar to primary depressives but are overall less severe. These findings give further support to the value of separating out secondary from primary depression in future research studies.",

This paper aims to discuss the \"disconnectivity\" hypothesis in relation to some neurological conditions which are known to alter brain connectivity, as well as mimicking some aspects of the disorder. After a short historical introduction to the concept, we will examine the evidence for connectivity problems in schizophrenia, separating the anatomical level from the functional level. Then, we will discuss three different issues concerning connectivity: i) local reduction in connectivity without neuronal loss (within the gray matter); ii) reduction in or alteration of long-range connectivity (within the white matter); and iii) abnormal targets for connections. For each of these aspects, we will look at the conditions able to reproduce anomalies capable of increasing susceptibility to schizophrenia. We conclude that psychosis is more likely to occur: i) when long-range connectivity is concerned; ii) when lesions result in lengthening and scattering of conduction times; and iii) when there are high dopamine levels, shedding light on or adding weight to the idea of an interaction between dopamine and connectivity.",

In particular, this case involves, at the minimum, the complex interweaving of a psychosis not easily subsumed under either pure schizophrenia or pure affective disorder together with substance abuse.

      "title": "Duloxetine in the Treatment of Depression: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disorder that can be classified in the categories of non-organic psychiatric disorders and mood disorders. Mood tone is an important psychic function involved in the adaptation to both our internal and external world. It is flexible, that is, it goes up when we are in positive and favorable conditions, but it goes down when we are in negative and unpleasant states. We can define depression as a condition when mood tone loses its flexibility, it goes down and its no longer influenced by favorable external events. In fact, depression is characterized by changes in the way how the affected individual thinks, feels and acts. Even if this change occurs gradually, a depressed subject is not the same as before. For example, a brilliant student could be persuaded to be not able to finish his studies; an affectionate mother could start to neglect her sons; an enterprising worker could lose every interest for his activity. Moreover, a depressed person doesnt care of his aspect or of himself. The surviving instinct could leave place to the desire to stop his own life. The most evident characteristic of depression in the adulthood is a sad mood, a gloomy solitary and apathetic attitude. A depressed subject could cry also with no apparent reason, he could have difficulty falling asleep or he could wake up very early in the morning and no longer returns to sleep. Or, instead, he could sleep more than usually and he could feel tired persistently. He could lose appetite and weight, or, in some cases, he could eat much more than usually and he could gain weight. Typically, a depressed person feels himself in a extremely negative way, he could think to be hopeless and helpless and he often condemns himself for small guilty. A depressed subject is pessimistic about himself and his own future; he loses interest in all what happens around him and he gets no satisfaction from the activities that before were pleasant. Some persons can be depressed also if they dont show evident signs of depression, but they complain for physical symptoms or they abuse of alcohol or other substances. It has been estimated that in the industrialized Western world one to six persons has a depressive episode at least once during his life; at present, the incidence of depression in the general population is around 5% with clear cut prevalence in the female sex. This leads to high social costs: behind the short-term inability, we have to consider also the long term inability (it has been estimated that, in 2020, depression will represent the second most frequent cause of permanent inability) as well as the suicide risk, the proved major susceptibility of depressed subjects to various non-psychiatric pathologies and the increased rate of premature deaths of depressed individuals as compared to the general population. The present work not only evaluates the drugs used for the treatment of depression, but it focuses also on those studies that investigated the efficacy of a second generation drug: Duloxetine that has a higher selectivity of action and a better tolerability profile as compared to first generation medications. These characteristics make Duloxetine the most effective therapeutic choice to improve both psychological and somatic symptoms of depression in order to get higher rates of symptomatic remission on depressive episodes.

Although the specific cause of schizophrenia remains unknown, research shows that genetics, psychological, social and cultural factors play a role in appearance and development of schizophrenia. Prevalence of schizophrenia is around 1% of the world population. Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10 (ICD-10 or MKB-X) or the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with social rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Usually family members and friends try to convince the patient that they need the treatment which is often seen as a problem since schizophrenic patients more often than not do not have insight of their condition and do not recognise the symptoms that help doctors to diagnose their condition. The improvement of state of schizophrenic person correlates with family members' involvement in the life of schizophrenic person since family members are able to notice causes of negative behaviour and are able to intervene before symptoms of schizophrenia manifest.",

      "title": "Review of the Current Knowledge of Reactive Attachment Disorder",
      "abstract": "Reactive attachment disorder (RAD), classified under Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders in the DSM-5 manual, is a childhood psychiatric illness due to familial or social neglect or due to maltreatment. It is characterized by an inhibited and withdrawn social and emotional behavior toward an adult caregiver, typically before the age of 5. Neurobiological changes in patients with RAD have been shown to be substantially significant with features such as loss of grey matter volume and neurotransmitter deficiencies that not only impact the ability to form healthy attachments but also increase the risk of comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. Different theories, including the current mediation hypothesis and learning theory of attachment, showed childhood maltreatment from caregivers and desensitization toward deficiencies in social development in children from special education teachers to be key components in the development of RAD. Patients with RAD had an increased risk of developing psychiatric comorbidities, including learning disabilities and mood disorders. Institutionalized care and childhood maltreatment have a significant impact on the development of RAD. RAD is an underdiagnosed and underreported condition with significant repercussions that can severely impact the development of a child. By being able to raise awareness and promote further research into refining the diagnostic methodology, treatment protocols, and long-term follow-up, children afflicted with this condition may be able to develop better socio-emotional bonds and reduce the incidence of comorbidities such as depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Although mental health issues in ageing individuals have been receiving more attention, borderline personality disorder (BPD) in older adults and the elderly has been relatively neglected. This article aims to review the current state of knowledge about BPD in these age groups. Recent findings Studies have consistently reported decreasing prevalence rates of BPD among ageing individuals. This may be attributed to the ageing process itself and/or different clinical features due to which meeting the diagnostic criteria for BPD becomes more difficult. Ageing individuals with BPD often present in a way that makes them look ‘atypical’ compared to younger individuals with the same condition. In particular, this pertains to somewhat attenuated and less overt manifestations of impulsivity. However, the basic pattern of overall symptoms instability continues to characterize ageing individuals with BPD, in addition to depressive symptoms, feeling of emptiness, anger, unstable interpersonal relationships, turbulent responses when needs are not met, various somatic complaints and other symptoms. Summary Clinicians should be aware of different clinical features of BPD as patients get older. Diagnostic criteria for BPD may need to be revised to reflect this reality, allow accurate diagnosis and minimize the risk of overlooking BPD in ageing individuals.",

      "abstract": "Hypochondriasis has common features with a number of other mental disorders, its boundaries are not always easy to draw and it occurs frequently with several psychiatric conditions. This review examines the relationships between hypochondriasis and other psychopathology in two ways. First, it discusses the differential diagnosis of hypochondriasis by identifying both the similarities and differences between hypochondriasis and organic diseases, psychotic disorders, depression, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia of illness and somatization disorder. The greatest overlap seems to exist between hypochondriasis and panic disorder, but hypochondriasis can still be distinguished from it, as well as from other disorders. The diagnosis of hypochondriasis is not warranted in the presence of psychotic features, but it can be made alongside diagnoses of most other disorders, provided that hypochondriacal features are not better explained by them. In the second part, the article reviews studies of the cooccurrence of hypochondriasis and other disorders. The literature reveals some inconsistencies and discrepant findings, which is largely due to different settings in which studies have been conducted and various other methodological issues. Still, it appears that hypochondriasis is more likely to co-occur with depression, panic disorder and somatization disorder than with other psychiatric conditions, suggesting a closer relationship with them. The implications of these findings for the conceptualization of hypochondriasis, its diagnostic status and classification are briefly considered. Keywords: Comorbidity, depression, diagnosis, hypochondriasis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, somatization disorder.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Anhedonia is a symptom usually, and probably simplistically, defined as the inability to experience pleasure. It is considered one of the core symptoms of depression and a negative symptom of schizophrenia. Objectives We intend to explore whether previous studies found common or dissimilar experiences of anhedonia in depression and schizophrenia. Methods We performed a review of the published literature on the subject using PubMed. We conducted a search using ‘anhedonia’, ‘schizophrenia’, and ‘depression’ as keywords. Results There is different and diverging evidence on the matter. Historical reports associated schizophrenia with trait anhedonia, and depression with state anhedonia. More recently, some authors correlated appetitive anhedonia (lack of interest/desire) with schizophrenia, and consummatory anhedonia (lack of pleasure/enjoyment) with depression, but this was not corroborated by other studies. However, in line with it, there are findings of a normal physiological response to pleasurable stimuli among schizophrenics. Some authors propose that, in schizophrenia, this symptom might not represent an inability to feel pleasure but rather a deficient expression of its experience, as a part of blunted affect. Reward models highlight a deficit in reward learning in depression, but disorganization of reward processing and a focus on irrelevant clues in schizophrenia, which prevent patients from pursuing a pleasurable experience. Conclusions There are still limited studies comparing the experience of anhedonia in depression and schizophrenia. There seem to be significant differences between the two, but further studies are needed. In particular, this could be important in screening schizophrenic patients for depression.

Often, an emotional fluctuation is present and it may have a sudden onset and a rapid remission. Objectives The review’s objective is to manifest acute polymorhic psychotic disorders and possible effective medical interventions. Methods The current case concerns a 52-year old mother of 4 children with the manifestation of acute polymorphic psychotic disorder with a background of a stressful factor. The patient was involuntarily hospitalized in the Psychiatric Hospital of Thessaloniki from 04/01/ 2019 -21/ 01/2019 due to disorganization and acute confusing condition within the last 9 days. Delusional ideas of religious content were first observed, which alternated with ideas of greatness and then persecution, association and self-denial. She also presented auditory hallucinations while there was a fluctuation of emotion from excessive euphoria to depression. The patient had no previous hospitalization in a psychiatric clinic, however, 7 months ago she experienced another acute psychotic epeisode, while at the age of 17 and under the influence of intense stress, she described mood disorders. Results The current symptoms subsided after one week from the day of admission. During her hospitalization, a brain CT was performed without presence of pathological findings. Initially, her medication included i.m. haloperidol 15mg / ml daily, followed by a change to per os paliperidone 9mg daily. Conclusions Her mental status was improved, with no disturbances of consciousness noted and she was discharged on paliperidone as home medication. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Attempted suicide is common in patients with psychiatric disorders, and may also occur in individuals with physical health problems. Suicide, even when completed, is not without meaning. Suicidal ideation is often triggered by feelings of hopelessness or social isolation. Individuals who commit suicide have usually indicated their wish to die either directly or indirectly prior to the suicide attempt. Persons who undertake suicide attempts usually go through the stages of contemplating suicidal ideas as a possibility to terminate intense suffering, which is followed by a period of ambivalence and narrowing of perceived alternative options before a final decision is made. Suicide attempts with terminal intent can be classified as desperate or impulsive. In a minority of cases, suicide is altruistically motivated, and such behaviour may not necessarily be associated with psychopathology.",

      "title": "Conversion and Somatization in Pediatrics",
      "abstract": "Although conversion disorder rarely is diagnosed formally in ordinary pediatric practice, busy pediatricians often do encounter the phenomenon of conversion. Conversion is the experiencing of unacceptable emotional conflicts as symptoms, usually but not always physical, rather than as mental events. Conversion is commonplace, affecting almost all body systems. It must be recognized and managed appropriately early in its course, lest inappropriate evaluations and treatments occur; in addition to their other costs, such unnecessary procedures may introduce the child inadvertently to such symptomatization as a life-long pattern of behavior. More than a century ago, Briquet recognized that at least 50% of adult \"professional patients\" begin their symptomatic careers before puberty; thus, inappropriate care of the young patient who has conversion symptoms may have serious, long-lasting consequences. Problems in Diagnosing Conversion The traditional diagnostic elements of conversion often are difficult to demonstrate in pediatric practice. Almost all are either not specific to conversion or hard to confirm in young patients for reasons of developmental immaturity. These \"standard\" elements include the following: • Stress or conflict preceding symptoms (true of many illnesses) • Unconscious symptom production outside the patient's awareness (thus often inaccessible to the pediatrician) • A model for the symptom (either unverifiable or prone to observer bias) • Primary gain or relief of underlying conflict (again, difficult to confirm)",

      "abstract": "A decline in social functioning is a hallmark of dementia and is associated with worsening cognitive impairment, various behavioral and psychological symptoms, and caregiver burden. Since the feeling of loneliness is related to social function decline in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, care for the social isolation that can cause loneliness is considered important in Japan, where the number of older people living alone is increasing. In addition to dementia, late-onset psychosis is also known to be affected by loneliness and social isolation. Psychosis that develops after age 60 and does not involve organic or affective disorders is defined as very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) and is known to be different in quality from psychosis that develops at a younger age. Social isolation has been reported as one of risk factors of VLOSLP, and although people with VLOSLP are independent in daily life, their social functioning is impaired in a way that is different from dementia due to their abnormalities in the content of thinking. Therefore, social isolation and decline of social functioning are also major problems for VLOSLP. Longitudinally, people with VLOSLP are more likely than the general older population to progress to dementia including Lewy body disease and Alzheimer’s disease subtypes. With the increasing importance of early diagnosis and intervention of these neurodegenerative diseases, identification and intervention of people with VLOSLP is a challenging but important topic. We are now investigating the use of robots with communication capabilities aiming to improve loneliness and social isolation of older people living alone with MCI, mild dementia and VLOSLP. On the other hand, we have found that loneliness in MCI and mild dementia does not necessarily correlate with social isolation status, such as living alone, indicating that loneliness and social isolation among older people requires further research.",

The asthmatic child personality is extremely various. It cannot be included in traditional psychiatric perspectives or psychological scheme. 2. The classical features of behaviour such as dependence and negation of aggressivity can appear frequently but are not specific. 3. In more than one third of cases, a particular system of interaction may occur, called \"allergic relation\", characterized by a) A lack of personal attachment (objectal relationship poorly differentiated), b) A need of fusional grasping to people and environment, c) A blocking-up the separation-individuation system. 4. In most cases a) A high emotional receptivity to traumatisms, b) Psychosomatic vulnerable structure of various types, b) Mental mechanisms leading to psychosomatic disorganization, especially a kind of depression quite obvious in severe forms. 5. So inferences may be drawn a) About the genesis of the asthmatic disease in which the immunologic personality cannot be parted from the whole, b) About the psychosomatic approach of asthma and its prevention. 6.

      "abstract": "L’alcoolo-dépendance est une maladie chronique hautement récidivante dont l’enjeu principal est la prévention des rechutes. Les rechutes sont favorisées par le ressenti du sujet vis-à-vis de son environnement social [1]. L’alcoolo-dépendance entraîne des troubles cognitivo-comportementaux dont des déficits de reconnaissance émotionnelle et une altération des interactions sociales [2] majorant le risque de rechutes [3]. Ces troubles pourraient être liés à une altération du sentiment de familiarité. La familiarité se définit comme un sentiment de connaissance préalable d’un stimulus générant une émotion inconsciente, sans souvenir conscient de son identité [4]. Nous nous proposons d’étudier la familiarité aux visages dans l’alcoolo-dépendance. Douze patients alcoolo-dépendants (AD) étaient appariés en sexe et en âge à 12 témoins (T). Les participants ne présentaient ni trouble psychiatrique, ni neurologique, ni addiction en dehors d’un trouble d’usage sévère d’alcool pour le groupe AD (classification DSM-5). Des morphes entre visages familiers et inconnus (contenant 5 à 95 % du visage familier) étaient présentés. Les sujets devaient indiquer les visages leur semblant familiers. Un pourcentage de réponse « familier » était alors calculé par niveau de familiarité, permettant de construire une fonction psychométrique par sujet, et d’en déduire le seuil de familiarité (pourcentage de familiarité contenue dans le morphe pour lequel 50 % des stimuli étaient considérés comme familiers). Les interactions sociales étaient évaluées par une échelle de cognition sociale (MASC). Le seuil de familiarité était significativement plus faible dans le groupe AD que dans le groupe T (48,79 % versus 54,94 % – p = 0,025). Parallèlement les 2 groupes différaient sur les scores au MASC (AD : 26/45 ; T : 31/45 – p = 0,015). Ces résultats démontrent une hyperfamiliarité dans l’alcoolo-dépendance, associée à une altération de la cognition sociale. L’implication de l’altération de ces deux processus sur les risques de rechute est abordée.",

People become more stable with sympathetic listening. The experience of loss and its associated feelings can be faced with acceptance, and even psychotic conditions can evaporate when the ring of isolation is broken. Refugees have a higher risk of mental illness than others, showing depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Because little has been written about refugees from a mental health perspective, professionals working therapeutically with them may not give as much consideration to socio-political and psychosocial influences as to traumatic events experienced by refugees. The feelings of helplessness that some refugees experience can be seen as typical of many situations of trauma. Recent scientific literature, mainly in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has recognized post traumatic stress disorder, both acute and chronic, as a specific clinical entity.",

Individuals with BDD suffer from time-consuming obsessions about their bodily appearance and excessive compulsive behaviors (for example, mirror-checking, excessive grooming, and skin-picking). Functioning and quality of life are typically very poor, and suicidality is markedly elevated. BDD currently affects 0.7% to 2.9% of the population; however, BDD typically goes unrecognized in clinical settings. This chapter discusses BDD’s definition and classification, epidemiology, demographics, and clinical features, including several case descriptions of BDD, age at onset, course of illness, comorbidity, morbidity (including suicidality), gender similarities and differences, and healthcare utilization. In addition, BDD’s relationships to obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, and social anxiety disorder are discussed.",

      "title": "The psychodynamic life narrative: a psychotherapeutic intervention useful in crisis situations.",
      "abstract": "The Psychodynamic Life Narrative is a psychotherapeutic maneuver used during the first few sessions of a consultation with a patient in a crisis situation. By establishing a powerful bond between physician and patient, it offers the possibility of a rapid relief of dysphoric symptoms. In some situations, it may be useful in mobilizing a recalcitrant patient to accept psychotherapy or, in the case of the physically ill, to accept diagnostic procedures and treatments previously refused. It is most effective in patients whose general adaptation has been stable and whose psychological homeostasis has been disrupted by a life event of real and symbolic significance. Though the psychodynamic life narrative was first explored as a therapeutic maneuver in the treatment of depression in the physically ill (Viederman and Perry 1980), for reasons which will be described below, it has applicability to other situations of crisis--in some cases crises that have occurred in the distant past and left residual symptoms. This maneuver is not presented as a substitute for long-term psychotherapy or psychoanalysis where this is required and possible, and has distinct disadvantages where these treatments are contemplated. However, in some situations it may lead to significant change, particularly in the area of self and object-representations.",

Komorbide Störungen komplizieren den Verlauf der bipolaren Störung: Im Schnitt haben Patienten mit bipolar affektiver Störung plus Komorbidität eine schlechteres Funktionsniveau, sie haben ein früheres Ersterkrankungsalter und sprechen schlechter auf die Therapie an. Es gibt wenig gesicherte Erkenntnis zur Therapie “komorbider” Störungen plus bipolar affektiver Störungen. Auch ist die nosologische Einordnung der zusätzlichen Erkrankungen nicht unumstritten: Manche genetischen und Verlaufsuntersuchungen weisen darauf hin, dass hinter dem gleichzeitigen Auftreten mehrerer psychischer Störungen eigenständige Krankheitsprozesse (im Sinne breiter Spektra oder “Formenkreise”) stehen könnten.",

      "title": "PROGNOSTIC CRITERIA IN SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "On the basis of a critical survey of the literature, the following conclusions are drawn concerning the significance of the various criteria of prognosis in schizophrenia: The prognosis is most favorable when the duration of illness is short; the type of onset acute; exogenic precipitating factors, obvious; the element of confusion and the presence of atypical symptoms (especially manic-depressive symptoms), prominent in the early symptomatology; and when process symptoms are minimal or absent. Conversely, when these conditions are reversed, the prognosis is least favorable. This group of criteria is of the greatest import in the assessment of prognosis in schizophrenia. Certain other factors seem to have some significance, although their relative prognostic importance cannot be clearly evaluated at the present time. Patients with a history of a previous episode of illness appear to have a better chance of remission; the more so, the longer the interval of time between attacks, the more complete the recovery during the preceding remission, and the greater the dissimilarity between the present and previous episodes. The incidence of manic-depressive psychoses in the hereditary background may be related to the development of atypical symptoms and thus favorably influence the outcome of the illness. From a prognostic point of view, asthenic body type is unfavorable, pyknic favorable; due to possible technical error, caution is required in classification of body-type. Extravert temperament and adequate pre-psychotic life-adjustment offer a more favorable outlook, in contrast to introversion and inadequacy of reaction to life situations. However, it should be noted that evaluation of these factors on the basis of information obtained from relatives and friends is only approximate. In general, the catatonic subtype offers the best prognosis and paranoids the worst, with simple and hebephrenic subtypes in an intermediate position. Acute cases which are so atypical as not to allow classification under any of these four subtypes, are especially favorable prognostically. A progressive hospital course is ominous, whereas improvement or fluctuation is indicative of a more favorable outcome. Male or female sex, education and abilities, and psycho-sexual history seem to have no prognostic significance. Likewise the factor of age at onset of illness does not contribute to the assessment of outcome, except that relatively late age offers an unfavorable prognosis.",

This article aimed to review neurobiological bases of social cognition and theory of mind which try to explain social cognition. \nPubMed medical search engine was queried to find out the studies and review articles on social cognition and theory of mind in AD and PDDs.\nSocial cognition may be defined as the ability to interact in complex social areas with understanding the others? intentions and thoughts. The mind deficit is theorized to be one of the basic difficulties in autism. Individuals with autism have deficits in recognizing mental processes and mental representations of self and others?. Patients with AD have deficits in social functions which an important part of interpersonal interactions and functioning within a social group; like face recognition, eye contact and emotional expression recognition.\nFrontal lobe, temporal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, amygdala, posterior association cortex and their internal associations are brain areas associated with social cognition. Fusiform gyrus and amygdala are effective in face perception and recognition. Studies suggest that a deficit in amygdala may lead to social perceptional deficits like face identity and emotional expression recognition. It is determined that individuals with PDDs have hypoactivation in fusiform gyrus during perception of faces. Amygdala has a regulatory effect on fusiform gyrus and in lesions of amygdala, the hypoactivation of fusiform gyrus for emotional salient faces are parallel to the level of amygdala lesion. The common result of many studies is that the hypoactivation of fusiform gyrus is based on some processes related to amygdala. Superior temporal sulcus hypoactivations and abnormal volume measures were found in patients with autistic disorder. Superior tempral sulcus has a role in perception of social stimulus from gaze directions, and eye and body movements of others?. Autism can be defined as a social cognition disorder and is caused by deficits at microscopic and/or macroscopic levels in these brain systems.\nThe review of the neurobiology of social cognition in AD and other PPDs defisits in amygdala and in connections of amygdala with other temporal areas including fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus in early infancy and that leads to a deficit or absence of infant?s interest for faces and other stimuli which are socially significant.

Recently developed measurements of stress, specifically the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS), allow a more focused perspective on the differing psychosocial pathways to psychiatric and physical disorder. This is the result of the level of measurement employed by the LEDS, whereby specific qualities of distress, such as losses, dangers, frustrations, and so on, can be distinguished from each other within the overall category of distressing/unpleasant experience. Studies of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, abdominal pain, appendectomy, menorrhagia, secondary amenorrhea, and myocardial infarction using the LEDS suggest that the specific qualities of the stressors involved in the onset of each condition may parallel similar predisposing vulnerabilities in the personalities of those becoming ill, and corresponding psychiatric conditions between stressor and somatic onset.

      "abstract": "NICE recommends that when adults present in primary care with depression, they should be asked about previous periods of overactivity or disinhibited behaviour. If this behaviour lasted for four or more days referral for a specialist mental health assessment should be considered. Although depressive episodes are not necessary for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, they are common and dominate the lifetime pattern of the condition: 50% of the time is spent in a euthymic (well) state, 38% in a depressed and 12% in a manic state. If there have only been depressive symptoms, it is not possible to exclude bipolar disorder. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is supported by diagnostic criteria and usually confirmed by a psychiatrist. If the GP suspects mania or severe depression, or if patients are a danger to themselves or others, an urgent referral should be made for a specialist mental health assessment. If a manic episode has been present during the history the diagnosis is bipolar I disorder, while a hypomanic episode is indicative of bipolar disorder. The patient's care plan should include current health status, social situation, social support, co-ordination arrangements with secondary care, details of early warning signs, and the patient's preferred course of action in the event of a clinical relapse. Physical health checks should focus on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and respiratory disease given the heightened risk for these illnesses in bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Emotion Dysregulation and Psychosis Spectrum Disorders",
      "abstract": "Psychosis spectrum disorders (PSDs) are complex, highly heritable psychiatric conditions with high economic and societal costs. PSDs have historically been conceptualized as neurocognitive disorders in which psychotic episodes and impairments in social and emotional functioning are attributed to deficits in neurocognition. Although cognitive pathways play an important role in the etiology and presentation of PSDs, recent research suggests that interrelations between cognition and emotion are highly relevant. Moreover, aberrant emotion regulation likely plays a significant role in the presentation of PSDs. Emotion dysregulation (ED) may underlie and exacerbate both negative and positive symptoms in PSDs, such as blunted affect, avolition, disorganized speech and behavior, poor social cognition, and delusions and hallucinations. Advances in measurement of emotion dysregulation—including self-reports, behavioral paradigms, neuroimaging paradigms, and neurophysiological assessment—have informed etiological models of emotion dysregulation in PSDs. This chapter reviews research on emotion regulation and dysregulation in PSDs. Notably, more severe presentations of emotion symptoms and greater emotion regulation impairments are associated with worse outcomes in PSDs. It may therefore be the case that focusing on ED as an early risk factor and intervention target could improve outcomes and prevention approaches for psychotic disorders.",

      "title": "The Nature of Psychotic Symptoms",
      "abstract": "A hypothesis raised in the first edition of this book, that psychotic symptoms often originate in traumatic experiences and relate to dissociation, is updated and expanded in this chapter. Evidence now demonstrates that traumatic experiences clearly may be linked to psychotic symptoms, and dissociation predicts not only voice hearing, but other forms of hallucinations and delusions as well. Strongly linked to dissociation are the so-called first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly passivity experiences such as believing that one’s thoughts, feelings, or actions are not under one’s own control. Traumatic, dissociation and, to a lesser extent, attachment-based explanations for psychotic symptoms are proposed. It is argued that psychotic symptoms are substantially overemphasized in the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, leading to a high likelihood of misdiagnosing dissociative disorders as schizophrenia, with the accompanying risks of stigma and inappropriate forms of treatment. This is particularly concerning as there is anecdotal evidence that antipsychotic medications are even less effective and more dangerous for dissociative disorders than for psychotic disorders, while trauma and dissociation-based treatments have demonstrated efficacy for psychotic symptoms. Thus, the traumatic and dissociative nature of some, if not most, psychotic symptoms should, for theoretical, clinical and ethical reasons, finally be acknowledged.",

      "abstract": "This review focuses on suicide in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as well as risk factors and comorbidities of persons with ASD who have attempted suicide. Research was conducted by searching PubMed and Psychinfo for articles. Suicide in ASD is largely understudied. Although suicide is common in clinical samples, we have little knowledge of suicide in persons with ASD in the general population. Comorbidity, particularly with depression and other affective disorders or schizoid disorders and psychotic symptoms, is often reported, so it is difficult to determine if suicidality is associated with ASD or the comorbid disorder. Clinical samples suggest that suicide occurs more frequently in high functioning autism. Physical and sexual abuse, bullying, and changes in routine are precipitating events associated with suicide risk. Persons with ASD present risk factors inherent to their diagnosis (deficit in expression of feelings and thoughts), along with risk factors pertaining to the general population (abuse, depression, anxiety, etc.). The inability of persons with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) to express emotions and thoughts makes the diagnosis of suicidal ideation difficult and demands important adjustments to traditional psychotherapeutic interventions. More research is needed to determine the incidence of suicidal behaviors in persons with ASD, to identify risk and protective factors, as well as to assess the effectiveness of prevention strategies and interventions.",

      "title": "Information Processing in Stuttering",
      "abstract": "Adults who stutter are at risk of developing a range of psychological issues, and those issueshave been implicated in failed speech rehabilitation. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the mostprevalent condition associated with stuttering. SAD has been prominent in psychologicalresearch in effort to understand the cause, maintenance and management of the condition. Toimprove the clinical management of stuttering it is critical to take account of cognitive theories ofSAD to further understanding of the mechanisms of anxiety onset and maintenance.Social anxiety disorder involves excessive, irrational, and debilitating fear of being humiliatedand embarrassed in social situations. Severe cases can result in high levels of avoidancewhich can lead to social isolation and failure to participate in many normal occupational, socialand interpersonal activities. However, not all situations can be avoided. A person with SAD islikely to encounter anxiety inducing situations on many occasions in absence of the fearedevent, and yet their fears persist. Hence, avoidance alone cannot account for this persistence ofanxiety. It is increasingly apparent that expectancies of social harm and fear of negative socialevaluation are central to the nature of anxiety associated with stuttering. Similar to theavoidance reported in SAD, avoidance is a common reaction reported by people who stutter,including avoidance of words, specific situations and eye contact.Cognitive theorists suggest that information processing biases are involved in maintenance offear and anxiety associated with SAD [Clark, D. M., & Wells, A. (1995). A cognitive model ofsocial phobia.In R. G. Heimberg, M. R. Liebowitz, D. A. Hope, & F. R. Schneier. (Eds.) SocialPhobia: Diagnosis, Assessment and Treatment. (pp. 69-93). New York: The Guildford Press;Rapee, R. M., &Heimberg, R. G. (1997). A cognitive-behavioral model of anxiety in socialphobia.Behaviour Research and Therapy, 35, 741-756]. These cognitive processes include (1)self-focused attention, (2) reduced processing of external social cues (3) intrusive mentalimagery, (4) rumination and (5) safety behaviors. Routine clinical psychology interventions toreduce anxiety in SAD involve identifying and eliminating information processing biases andclient safety behaviors. However, a recent publication has shown that during routine clinical treatment of stuttering speech-language pathologists commonly recommend that clients engagein a range of tasks that might function as safety behaviors. In other words, they may perpetuateclient social anxiety.The effects of information processing biases have been well documented in SAD and evidenceis emerging of such biases in adults who stutter. To improve clinical outcomes for people whostutter, there is a critical need for this research to continue. In particular, exploration of theextent to which people who stutter engage in information processing biases that are well knownto maintain anxiety in SAD. The application of models of SAD to stuttering research is crucial tothis line of research.",

Obtaining collateral information to consolidate the retrospective symptomatology is mandatory, since individuals with chronic attentional problems are prone to recollection bias.

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 0.6 to 1% of the population worldwide. It is characterized by a deficit in communication and social interaction, and is associated with restricted and repetitive behavior patterns. Stereotypes include inflexible adhesion to specific non-functional routines and rituals and a persistent concern with parts of objects rather than the object as a whole. Up to the present time, there are no specific tests that permit a laboratory diagnosis of the disorder to be carried out, and the syndrome is confirmed by clinical observation in the first 36 months of the patient’s life. Clinical manifestations such as epilepsy, mental retardation, sleep disorders, hyperactivity, irritability and auto- and heteroaggressiveness may alter the patient’s prognosis. Around 50% of children with ASD fulfill the criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) associated with autism appear to indicate a distinct phenotype requiring specific therapeutic measures. ASD is not a discrete nosological entity but, rather, a multifactorial syndrome associated with different phenotypic and biological presentations. Various disorders such as pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract have been linked to ASD, not only insofar as causality is concerned but also with respect to their role in aggravating the disease. Other associated disorders include lesions in physiological processes such as the redox metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction and enzymatic regulation of essential metabolites. Currently, studies on direct and indirect markers of mitochondrial metabolism associated with anomalies found in the brain of these patients point to the possibility of these markers being used as tools with which to reach a diagnosis that would be laboratory based rather than merely clinical.",

      "abstract": "Depression er en hyppigt forekommende psykisk lidelse, som forbindes med en lang række psykiske og fysiske symptomer. Disse symptomer kan påvirke dagligdagen i væsentlig grad og er typisk kendetegnet ved sænket stemningsleje, nedsat lyst eller interesse samt nedsat energi og øget trætbarhed. En stor andel af personer med en depressiv lidelse oplever ydermere udtalte vanskeligheder inden for det sociale domæne. For enkelte psykiatriske lidelser er sociale og interpersonelle vanskeligheder selvstændigt medregnet som et diagnostisk kriterium; fx inden for autismespektrumforstyrrelser. Dette er ikke tilfældet for depression, der ikke desto mindre ofte er kendetegnet ved betydelige og fremtrædende vanskeligheder inden for det samme domæne. Personer ramt af depression isolerer sig, oplever mindre glæde, og ofte udspiller der sig et større konfliktniveau i kontakten med deres nærmeste (Hirschfeld et al., 1999; Weightman, Knight, &amp; Baune, 2019). Den deprimerede persons sociale vanskeligheder er belastende i sig selv og øger samtidig risikoen for tab af social støtte, hvilket i sig selv kan udgøre en barriere for bedring i tilstanden. Det er bl.a. af disse grunde vigtigt at opnå indsigt i de kognitive mekanismer, der kan ligge til grund for hhv. adaptiv og maladaptiv social adfærd. Kognitiv svækkelse optræder typisk også i forbindelse med en depressiv episode, og talrige studier har dokumenteret vanskeligheder inden for en række kognitive domæner, herunder psykomotorisk tempo, opmærksomhed, hukommelse, indlæring og eksekutive funktioner (Rock, Roiser, Riedel, &amp; Blackwell, 2013). Socialkognitive vanskeligheder er anerkendt som et fremtrædende symptom ved en række psykiske lidelser, herunder autismespektrumforstyrrelser og skizofreni (Fernandes, Cajão, Lopes, Jerónimo, &amp; Barahona-Corrêa, 2018). I hvilket omfang samme type af deficits ligeledes er af betydning ved depression, har igennem en årrække stået mindre klart. Der er dog nu en voksende anerkendelse af socialkognition som et værdifuldt konstrukt i forståelsen af kognitive forstyrrelser ved depression og i forbindelse med velkendte psykosociale vanskeligheder ved samme. En introduktion til socialkognition vil blive givet i det følgende efterfulgt af en præsentation af fund inden for unipolar depressiv lidelse.",

      "abstract": "Marriage can be defined as the state of being united as spouses in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law. The general population generally believes marriage to be a solution to mental illnesses. It can be agreed that mental disorders and marital issues have some relation. Parents of patients with psychoses expect that marriage is the solution to the illness and often approach doctors and seek validation about the success of the marriage of their mentally ill child, which is a guarantee no doctor can give in even normal circumstances. Evidence on sexual functioning in patients of psychosis is limited and needs further understanding. Studies show about 60%–70% women of the schizophrenia spectrum and illness to experience sexual difficulties. Based on available information, sexual dysfunction in population with psychosis can be attributed to a variety of psychosocial factors, ranging from the psychotic symptoms in itself to social stigma and institutionalization and also due to the antipsychotic treatment. Despite the decline in sexual activity and quality of life in general, it is very rarely addressed by both the treating doctor and by the patient themselves hence creating a lacuna in the patient’s care and availability of information regarding the illness’ pathophysiology. Patients become noncompliant with medications due to this undesirable effect and hence it requires to be given more attention during treatment. It was also found that paranoid type of schizophrenia patient had lower chances of separation than patients with other types of schizophrenia. The risk of relapse in cases with later age of onset of the disease, lower education, a positive family history of psychosis or a lower income increased more than other populations.",

Since it is a neurobiological condition, its basic symptoms -lack of attention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness- are similar at all ages, but in adults the clinical manifestations are specific to the subgroup with more frequent comorbidities than in childhood. Manifestations that characteristically appear in adults are difficulty in concentrating, poorer memory and short-term memory, disorganisation, difficulties with self-discipline, impulsiveness, low self-esteem, mental restlessness, frustration and limited social skills.Today, adult cases are underdiagnosed because for a long time ADHD was thought to be a condition that only affected children and teenagers; however, although its clinical manifestations in adults are essentially similar to those seen in children, they are different and have different forms of presentation. There are no biomedical tests that allow an objective diagnosis to be established, and thus care must be taken to draw up and evaluate a patient record that includes possible symptoms since childhood, typical signs and symptoms, and any relevant comorbidities. Self-evaluation scales are necessary as the preferred instrument for use as an aid to the patient record. The main pharmacological treatment is based on psychopharmaceuticals such as immediate-, controlled- or extended-release methylphenidate and on atomoxetine; cognitive-behavioural and psychosocial treatment should also be associated.",

As the name suggests, it is a spectrum condition and therefore the range\r\nof symptoms and their severity is very wide; the symptoms which appear (generally\r\nduring early childhood and adolescence1) will differ significantly from person to\r\nperson.

      "title": "The psychiatric epidemic in the American workplace.",
      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Cotard syndrome (CS) is a rare neuropsychiatric condition characterized by nihilistic delusions, which may range from negation of existence of parts of the body to delusion of being dead or negation of self-existence, and it requires an urgent and appropriate therapy. Objectives Our objective is to highlight the importance of CS, reinforcing that medical professionals should be aware of this pathology to prompt clinical description, diagnostic and treatment. Aims The aim of this presentation is to alert psychiatrists to this remaining syndrome. Methods Review of phenomenological and theoretical issues regarding SC. Results CS can be found in numerous psychiatric or neurologic pathologies but it is most seen in patients with severe depression. It is typically divided in three subtypes: psychotic depression, Cotard type I, with nihilistic delusions without mood symptoms, and Cotard type II, with mood symptoms and auditory hallucinations. There are numerous etiological hypothesis mechanisms, including unusual perceptual experiences, which can similarly be involved in Capgras delusion, disconnection from emotional or limbic processes, an impaired belief evaluation or a tendency to excessive self-attribution. Frontotemporoparietal circuitry also seems to have an important role in its pathology. Treatment usually involves electroconvulsive therapy, antidepressants and anti-psychotics and the prognosis depends on the underlying disorders. Conclusions CS is a rare pathology with self-defeating risk and its clinical recognition and proper treatment are essential to improve the prognosis of these patients. Diagnostic criteria or clinical instruments for assessment of this syndrome should be encouraged, since its lack is a limitation for systematic studies and consequent management advances.

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities.

Rates of schizophrenia seem generally to be the same regardless of geographical location, though there is some evidence that those in developed nations have a higher incidence of the disorder. Also, immigrants who relocate to areas where their culture has little, or no representation are at more risk for schizophrenia. While the prevalence of schizophrenia is similar around the world, the presentation of the disorder can vary widely, depending on the cultural, religious, and supernatural beliefs native to specific areas.

Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking.

People living with mental illnesses are often mislabeled as violent, lazy, and a danger to society. This affects how people view themselves, and they may learn to identify with these labels, which may result in isolation and self-stigmatization. Consequently, this self-stigmatization may cause people them to avoid seeking the treatment and help they need. Negative misconceptions also promote further discrimination in employment, housing, and educational opportunities available to people with mental illnesses. This can also lead to limited resources, awareness, and a lack of support for people and their families. Mental illnesses must be regarded and treated like any other medical condition. It is continued education, advocacy, and willingness to challenge misconceptions that can reduce the stigma associated with mental illnesses.",

      "title": "Intellectual disability",
      "abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID) is a global and persistent reduction in cognitive abilities beginning early in development and associated with impairment in daily functioning including communication, social skills, personal independence and school/work functioning. Classification systems distinguish levels of severity based on measured intellectual quotient (IQ) and degree of impairment in adaptive functioning. Prevalence estimates for ID vary widely but aggregate around 2-3% in high income countries, with mild ID about five times more common than severe forms. The multiple factors associated with ID are discussed including chromosomal disorders, genetic abnormalities, psychosocial adversity, exposure to prenatal infections and alcohol, postnatal exposure to environmental toxins and severe early deprivation. ID is associated with a three- to five-fold increased risk for all psychiatric disorders and about 15% of children with psychiatric disorders have ID. In childhood, ID is most strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Milder ID is often under-recognized and clinicians should be alert to warning signs, including poor academic attainments, school non-attendance and family history of learning and educational problems. When diagnosing psychiatric disorder in people with ID, considerations include the appropriateness of the behaviour in relation to developmental (rather than chronological) age and the multiple possible underlying causes for \"behaviour that challenges\" should be carefully assessed so that targeted interventions can be used. In general, there are at present no effective treatments for the core cognitive deficits of ID. Interventions focus on appropriate education and support for affected individuals and their families that maximize quality of life and community participation. Treatment planning should be multi-disciplinary and multi-agency. The limited evidence base for treating psychiatric disorders in ID supports the use of similar interventions, although effect sizes may be diminished. Pharmacotherapy should involve lower starting doses, more gradual increases and careful monitoring, as people with ID are more sensitive to adverse effects. Psychological interventions should utilize behavioural strategies, supported with visual materials and the involvement of parents, carers and other professionals such as teachers. Family-wide support and respite care from voluntary groups and social services may be invaluable.",

      "title": "Cytochrome p4502D6 and Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism in Patient with Bipolar Disorder Type II",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail, they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its constraints. However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems, leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in psychological dependency, which itself adversely affects the quality of life. These mechanisms of psychopathology may not hide the possibility of an underlying dementia.",

      "abstract": "An overview of schizophrenia is presented, including diagnostic criteria, etiology, neurologic findings, pharmacotherapy options, quality-of-life issues, and the financial impact of the disease. Schizophrenia is a chronic disease characterized by positive symptoms, negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and cognitive deficits. Often comorbid substance abuse is present. Schizophrenia accounts for 20% of all hospital bed-days and over 50% of all psychiatric beds in the United States. There is a strong genetic component to schizophrenia, and other possible contributing factors are explored. The diagnostic workup should include a detailed longitudinal history, mental status exam, physical and neurologic exams, and laboratory tests. A magnetic resonance imaging scan can rule out structural causes of psychosis and should be considered at the time of diagnosis. Treatment is based on a biopsychosocial model including pharmacotherapy in combination with individual, group, and family therapies. Rather than classifying antipsychotics as typical or atypical, a new classification scheme has been proposed based on risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia (TD), effect on prolactin level, and efficacy profile: first-generation or traditional agents (e.g., chlorpromazine and haloperidol); second-generation agents (e.g., risperidone and ziprasidone); and third-generation agents (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine). The binding affinities of antipsychotics in the brain help explain the mechanisms by which different antipsychotics alleviate specific symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as cause specific adverse effects. Improved cognition, fewer depressive and mood symptoms, and decreased risk of TD associated with third-generation antipsychotics have improved the quality of life for patients with schizophrenia.",

The greatest danger appears to be to allow any prepsychotic state to be labelled with this diagnosis. If there is slight but definite evidence of an abnormal psychotic state, this diagnosis should be made. As pointed out the inclusion of the milder cyclothymic cases and early schizoid cases under the heading of psychopathic personalities complicates and confuses a type of psychiatric work already vague and indeterminate.",

      "title": "Recurrent catatonia in a patient with Schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder",
      "abstract": "Catatonia occurs in more than 10% of acute psychiatric illnesses.[1] Catatonia is considered a syndrome associated with numerous conditions. A systematic review reported that 20.2% of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals had features of catatonia.[2] Here, we describe a case of recurrent catatonia in a patient with schizophrenia and ASD. The aim was to highlight the diagnostic dilemma experienced while trying to differentiate the catatonic symptoms from autistic symptoms, such as mutism, negativism, posturing, and unprovoked agitation. A 20-year-old male patient with no apparent past and family history and slow to warm temperament (decreased activity, reactivity, and responsiveness, repetitive movements, odd eccentric behavior, and difficulty in maintaining and sustaining eye contact) was brought to the psychiatry outpatient department (OPD) by his parents with a total duration of illness of 7 years, characterized by progressive functional decline and social withdrawal. The illness started with the patient avoiding going to school and eventually quitting. The patient remained confined to himself. He would barely interact with anyone. He started hearing voices not heard by others and was often seen muttering to himself. He would get angry over trivial issues. Occasional unprovoked anger outbursts were also reported by family members. He started to get suspicious of people around him thinking that they were trying to harm him. He would suspect that people have put cameras in the house to keep an eye on him and used to point at household appliances, claiming cameras are hidden behind them. He would not believe his family members when his claims were countered by them. He would be seen laughing and crying without any reason, along with significant disturbances in sleep. All these symptoms lasted for the initial 2 months of the illness. The patient was then taken to a psychiatrist and started on tablet risperidone 2 mg twice daily. There was an improvement in sleep, appetite, and suspiciousness after 1 month. According to the family members, he would remain distant from family members and would still get angry over trivial issues. The patient took medications for 1 month and subsequently became noncompliant. During this period, negative symptoms persisted, resulting in significant functional decline. The patient was taken to various psychiatrists during the next 6 years, and treatment records showed some improvement in negative symptoms on tablet fluoxetine 20 mg, which the patient took for 3–4 months, and then, subsequent noncompliance with treatment was noted. The patient during the last 4–5 months following noncompliance with treatment developed symptoms of unprovoked anger outbursts, maintaining odd postures for long durations, mutism, withdrawal, and negativism. Following this, the patient was admitted to the male psychiatry ward and a detailed neurological examination was performed and revealed no significant abnormality. Blood investigations (complete blood count (CBC), kidney function test (KFT) with serum electrolyte (SE), liver function test (LFT), electrocardiogram (ECG), and thyroid function test (TFT)) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed no abnormality. A diagnosis of catatonia was made. Bush-Francis catatonia rating scale was applied, revealing a score of 17. The lorazepam challenge test was negative. The patient was started on the tablet olanzapine, which was gradually increased to 20 mg. Ten sessions of modified electroconvulsive therapy were given. There was a significant improvement in all the symptoms, apart from some negative symptoms and catatonic symptoms (mutism, negativism, posturing, unprovoked agitation, and poor eye contact). To treat negative symptoms, amisulpride 50 mg was added and gradually built up to 300 mg along with fluoxetine 20 mg because of the good response in the past. There was a significant improvement in all of the symptoms apart from autistic symptoms. The patient was then discharged and followed up closely. Overlapping symptoms of ASD and catatonia, in this case, made diagnosis a little difficult.[1] It has been advocated that catatonia and ASD have the same neuronal dysfunction with only a change in age of onset, leading to incomplete symptom overlap, which genetic linkage studies support advocating a common genetic region (15q15-q21) for both catatonia and autism.[2] Electroconvulsive therapy can potentially benefit patients with ASD associated with catatonia. Instead of being viewed as comorbidity, such autistic catatonic experiences are likely best understood as a specific intrinsic expression of the underlying autistic spectrum disease. This would imply that rather than relying on the diagnosis of catatonia, therapies for these behaviors should be based on knowledge of people's sensory, perceptual, and neurocognitive functioning.[3-6] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms. In the form, the patient has given his consent for his images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal.

      "abstract": "The available study findings on the course and outcome of schizophrenia beginning in childhood or adolescence can be summarized as follows. (1) Schizophrenic psychoses that arise before the age of 13 have a very poor prognosis. The disease usually continues to progress in adolescence and adulthood. It can be diagnosed with the same criteria that are used for adults. (2) Patients whose disease is of acute onset, with productive schizophrenic manifestations such as hallucinations and delusions (positive manifestations), have a better prognosis than those whose disease begins insidiously and takes an unfavorable course, with depressive states and continually worsening impairment of cognitive function. (3) The patient’s premorbid personality plays a major role. Patients who were described as socially active, intelligent, and integrated children and adolescents before they became ill have a better prognosis than those who were intellectually impaired, timid, introverted and uncommunicative before they became ill. (4) The prognosis seems to be better for patients who have no family history of schizophrenia, those whose families cooperate well, and those whose condition improves rapidly during inpatient treatment. (5) The few available studies on the course and outcome of schizophrenia beginning in childhood and early adolescence confirm that they are much worse than in adult-onset schizophrenia. (6) A 42-year longitudinal study of patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia revealed their suicide rate to be higher than that of patients with adult-onset schizophrenia. No further longitudinal studies are available to confirm this finding.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mortality and neurological and mental outcome were studied in infants 28 days to 1 year of age with afebrile seizures not due to an acute postnatal injury. Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history. RÉSUMÉ On a étudiea la mortalité et le pronostic neurologique et intellectuel des enfants ayant eu entre L'âge été 28 jours et celui d'un an plusieurs crises épileptiques sans fiàevre, non liées a une atteinte cérébrale aiguë.

Los casos fueron divididos en 4 tipos été ataques: espasmos infantiles, estatus epilepticus, y “otros” generalizados o parciales (enfermos sin espasmos o status). Durante más été un ano se estudié la mortalidad en 334 casos y el pronéstico mental y neurologico en 313 ninos. El pronostico global fué muy pobre incluso en los casos sin espasmos infantiles. La mortalidad fue más alta y las secuelas neurológicas m^s comunes en los casos sintomaticos que en los criptogenicos. La más alta mortalidad y el mayor niimero été defectos neurolbgicos se encontraron en los status epilepticus y en el grupo été“otros” ataques parciales. Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

      "title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder: comorbidities and psychosocial impairment",
      "abstract": "This article reviews our current understanding of depressive and bipolar disorders in teenage girls. It highlights issues related to causality, assessment and treatment. Early onset depression arises as a consequence of inter-related predisposing and precipitating factors which together lead to alterations to biological and psychological functioning and result in depression. Assessment needs to be carefully and thoroughly undertaken by a clinician with experience in child and adolescent mental health problems. Following a brief psychoeducational intervention, further treatment should be initially with psychotherapeutic approaches. Cognitive and interpersonal therapies are supported by the best evidence. Pharmacological treatments may be associated with increased suicidal ideation and behaviour and should only be initiated by those with specialist training and experience in child and adolescent mental health problems. Early onset bipolar disorder remains a controversial area of practice, with uncertainty over the application of diagnostic criteria, validity of the disorder and its relationship with other disorders such as ADHD. For those adolescents and, rarely, children with true bipolar disorder, the longer-term outcome for early-onset bipolar disorder appears to be similar to that for adults, although younger sufferers are more likely to have a more rapidly cycling clinical picture than adults. There is very little research evidence investigating response to medication although there is some evidence for the efficacy of lithium, valproic acid and carbamazepine in the treatment of early-onset mania.",

      "title": "Role of cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Schizophrenia is a severe and usually chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by dysfunction in many domains. Hallucinations, delusions, and behavioral disturbances are prominent symptoms of the illness, and are appropriately a focus for treatment, but less attention is given to the cognitive deficits that are also typically found in schizophrenia. Whilst impairments in learning, memory, and executive function have been recognized for many decades, deficits in more subtle aspects of cognition have been recognized more recently. These include biases in the evaluation of information and difficulties with emotional and social cognition. Cognitive deficits make a substantial contribution to real-world function, and improving cognition has the potential to improve social and vocational outcomes. This review provides an overview of potential treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, including medications, psychological therapies, and neurostimulation. Despite optimal medication and case management, many people with schizophrenia do not achieve full remission. There is sufficient evidence to encourage widespread adoption of at least some of the current cognitive enhancement strategies. However, individual patients differ in terms of their symptoms, patterns of cognitive dysfunction, medication response, and social and occupational situations. Considerable work is therefore needed to personalize cognitive remediation to maximize the benefits. However, at present, these methods are underutilized, even when applied in a universal manner where all subjects receive the same treatment. The barriers to wider availability of these treatments are discussed. Keywords: schizophrenia, psychosis, cognition, treatment, remediation",

      "abstract": "Autism is a lifelong condition characterised by difficulties in social interaction and communication and by rigid or repetitive behaviours; it affects about 1.1% of adults.1 Although some people’s autism is diagnosed in childhood, for every three known cases, there are two individuals without a diagnosis who might need assessment, support, and interventions for autism at some point in their lives.2 Four out of five adults with autism find that obtaining a diagnosis in adulthood is difficult or not possible,3 and many who have all the core symptoms do not receive a formal diagnosis.4 Particular problems arise in identifying high functioning autism (Asperger’s syndrome), which may not be recognised until adulthood5 or may be misdiagnosed as depression, personality disorder, or a psychotic illness. Inadequate identification and assessment of adults with autism not only leads to inadequate care but can also result in inadequate recognition and treatment of coexisting mental and physical health problems. Whereas care for children and young people is relatively well coordinated6 this is often not the case for adults. Falling between and being passed around services is a particular problem for adults with autism who have an IQ over 70 and do not have severe and enduring mental illness, as they may be excluded from both learning disabilities and mental health services.3 Social and economic exclusion affects a large proportion of adults with autism. Unemployment or underemployment is a considerable problem for adults with autism, including the 44% of those who do not have a learning disability,7 with almost 90% of this group unemployed.8\n\nThis article summarises the most recent recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on autism in adults.9\n\nNICE recommendations are based on systematic reviews of best available evidence and explicit …",

Mental deterioration is often the first symptom, evolving progressively; and dementia finally occurs. The latency before the appearance of neurological objective symptoms may be long and extend for several years. In many cases, the behavioral abnormalities are the first symptoms. Some of these forms have been diagnosed as schizophrenia. Very seldom, neurological symptoms, especially ataxia, occur without cognitive or psychiatric disturbances. Most of these cases have pyramidal and cerebellar symptoms, at diverse degrees. Seizures can also occur which in some cases can be early symptoms associated to mental deterioration. The association of central and peripheral neurological symptoms is very characteristic of MLD. The peripheral neuropathy is not generally clinically evidenced, but is rarely-missing electrophysiologically. Arylsulfatase A determination should be performed for diagnosis as a first step, and confirmed by the accumulation of sulfatide, either by quantitative determinations in urine or by the sulfatide loading test. It is as yet not clear why certain forms have a rather rapid evolution in 5 years, and others have a very protracted course during decades.",

The patterns of mental disorders co-occurring with ASD could not be summarized into any consistent and easy-to-interpret model of co-morbidity. Thus, research on ASD should consider and not rule out coexisting mental conditions (and include persons with complex problems in studies), clinical assessments, and evaluations. Ignoring the complexity of co-occurring conditions will have detrimental effects in research, counteracting our understanding of the etiology behind ASD and the development of evidence-based, comprehensive treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "The current chapter examines the associations between psychopathy and its subcomponents and various features of emotion regulation (ER). Overall, there is a significant association between psychopathy and ER difficulties. These difficulties are likely to span across several overlapping ER domains, including emotional non-acceptance, poor emotional awareness and clarity, access to limited repertoire of effective ER strategies, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior when upset (i.e., poor distress tolerance), and difficulties inhibiting impulsive behavior under emotional arousal (i.e., negative urgency). This pattern seems generally consistent with historical and contemporary conceptualizations of psychopathy. More overt features of psychopathy (i.e., behavioral) are strongly related to emotion dysregulation, also in line with the different contemporary perspectives reviewed earlier. More recent research has extended beyond theoretical expectations by showing that the ER disturbances linked to psychopathy are widespread and not limited to specific ER components, and also that these disturbances are not merely the reflection of general externalizing psychopathology or negative emotionality.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is characterized by heterogeneous clinical outcome. Most often, this disease has a major negative impact on the social outcome. When a symptomatic remission is obtained, the antipsychotic should be maintained at medium or long-term to prevent the occurrence of a new episode. Medication adherence is often of poor quality. It may be improved by simplifying the drug treatment and by reducing its side-effects. The implementation of educational programs for the patient and his/her family should be encouraged. Comorbity of substance use, in particular of cannabis use, is frequent and is a strong risk factor for relapse. Request for disability benefit should be rapidly considered in order to reduce the social consequences of the disease due to lack of resources.",

      "title": "Depressive Symptoms in Medicated Patients with Schizophrenia: An Egyptian Sample",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder. Persons with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations, delusions, disorganized behaviors, negative symptoms and disturbance in social functioning. Schizophrenia consists of a range of features. Patients may display improper affect and delusions and as a result, fear and worry may follow. The incidence of depressive episodes is common in schizophrenia, with a common symptomatology. Consequently, the diagnosis of their comorbidity is challenging for both clinicians and researchers. Within this context, the presence of comorbid depression negatively affects quality of life, underlies psycho pathology and the brutality of associated medical conditions 10. In addition, pharmacotherapy of schizophrenic patients with depression is different from that of patients with schizophrenia alone. Objective This study aims to To measure the intensity of suicidal ideations in the patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and co-morbid depression and to compare the severity of depression and suicidal symptoms in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and co-morbid depression who are compliant on treatment regarding taking with conventional or atypical antipsychotics. Patients and Methods Between November 2022 and March 2023 in Ain Shams University, 92 patients attending the General Psychiatry outpatient clinics at Okasha Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University Hospitals (all aged 18–65 years) were interviewed using semi-structured designed questionnaire to assess psychiatric, medical history, medication history, SCID I for diagnosis of schizophrenia and depression according to the DSM-IV, The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) for assessing the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, Beck’s suicidal ideation scale (BSI) for detecting and measuring the current intensity of the patients’ specific attitudes, behaviors, plans to commit suicide, Morisky 8-Item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) and Socioeconomic status scale (SES). Results On descriptive analysis between children and adolescents presenting with psychiatric and neurologic complaints The Hamilton depression scale showed significant difference as, median Hamilton depression scale in patients who consumed typical medication 8 with IQR = 5.75 was higher than median Hamilton depression scale in patients who consumed atypical medication 5 with IQR = 3, p-value = 0.002. Meanwhile, Number of previous hospitalizations showed significant association as, median previous hospitalizations in patients who consumed atypical medication 2 with IQR = 2 was higher than median previous hospitalizations in patients who consumed typical medication 1 with IQR = 1, p-value = 0.026. Conclusion In conclusion, the present study suggests that patients with schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with depression frequently have clinical symptoms of depression, with the possible exception of a contribution from negative symptoms. However, depressive symptoms may be more common in schizophrenic patients treated with typical antipsychotic drugs than in schizophrenic patients treated with atypical.",

This overview of the literature shows that individuals who suffer abuse, neglect, or serious family dysfunction as children are more likely to be depressed, to experience other types of psychiatric illness, to have more physical symptoms (both medically explained and unexplained), and to engage in more health-risk behaviors than their nonabused counterparts. The more severe the abuse, the stronger the association with poor outcomes in adulthood. Childhood sexual abuse in particular has been repeatedly associated, in adulthood, with physical complaints such as chronic pain that are likewise associated with depression. Individuals with a history of childhood abuse, particularly sexual abuse, are more likely than individuals with no history of abuse to become high utilizers of medical care and emergency services. Childhood maltreatment is highly prevalent among both men and women, especially in specialty settings such as emergency psychiatric care.",

The disorder occurs in the context of relationships: sometimes all relationships are affected, sometimes only one. It usually begins during adolescence or early adulthood. While some persons with BPD are high functioning in certain settings, their private lives may be in turmoil. Most people who have BPD suffer from problems regulating their emotions and thoughts, impulsive and sometimes reckless behavior, and unstable relationships Other disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, substance abuse and other personality disorders can often exist along with BPD. The diagnosis of BPD is frequently missed and a misdiagnosis of BPD has been shown to delay and/or prevent recovery. Bipolar disorder is one example of a misdiagnosis as it also includes mood instability. There are important differences between these conditions but both involve unstable moods. For the person with bipolar disorder, the mood changes exist for weeks or even months. The mood changes in BPD are much shorter and can even occur within the day. Officially recognized in 1980 by the psychiatric community, BPD is more than two decades behind in research, treatment options, and family psycho-education compared to other major psychiatric disorders. BPD has historically met with widespread misunderstanding and blatant stigma. However, evidenced-based treatments have emerged over the past two decades bringing hope to those diagnosed with the disorder and their loved ones.",

It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

The disturbances induced constitute a psychoneurotoxic syndrome--\"a state of drunkenness\"--of about four hours duration which develops in three distinct phases. The basic mental symptoms of this syndrome consist of disturbances of the apperception, sensory perception and emotion. A moderate impairment of egofunctioning or reality appraisal and an inability to integrate different mental processes are observed. The psychomotor behavior is mainly harmonized to the prevailing emotional state and to the experiences caused by perceptual alterations, in a lesser degree. These changes, according to our observations, are more severe and more \"psychotic-like\" in schizophrenics rather than in normals. Psychopathological analysis of these changes proves that the whole syndrome cannot be considered as related to the spontaneously triggered functional psychoses or to the organic ones and, therefore, the term \"model-psychosis\" according to our opinion, is unsatisfactory.",

Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

PTSD, and ‘Borderline’ symptoms are often linked with a past history of childhood trauma.We hypothesise that the development of psychotic symptoms related to trauma may occur in a different pattern than the development of psychosis of neuro-developmental origin [schizophrenia].Methods:We present a series of Vigniettes, all of whom have developed psychosis. Three have experienced major trauma, in Early Adulthood, Two have experienced a major trauma related to a war situation., and two, have developed psychotic illness of a neuro-developmental type [schizophrenia].Results:As expected, the cases of neuro-developmental psychosis developed psychosis over a long prodromal period, in which symptoms developed from non-specific depression and anxiety to a gradual increase of positive psychotic symptoms over time, until full psychosis developed.The five cases where psycho-trauma occurred in adulthood [including the two wartime cases and the three other cases] showed sudden development of symptoms at the time of the trauma including PTSD and borderline symptoms. The psychotic symptoms developed, also suddenly, some time later, after a subsequent episode of psycho-trauma.Conclusion:These different patterns of development of psychotic symptoms suggest different mechanisms of causation. Nonetheless, in all these cases, a full blown psychotic illness may result. In cases of psycho-trauma, the illness may continue to be accompanied by ongoing symptoms of PTSD and Borderline features, making these patients difficult to treat.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently enters the central nervous system (CNS) soon after infection, and frequently produces a wide variety of neurologic, cognitive, and psychiatric complications. Although, the entire spectrum of psychiatric illnesses may be seen in individuals with HIV infection, most are probably not directly caused by the virus. Psychiatric manifestations that are the direct result of HIV infection are usually seen in the setting of HIV-associated dementia. In this paper, it is proposed that these psychiatric manifestations of HIV infection can be phenomenologically separated into positive and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are deficit states presenting as cognitive, social, or motivational deterioration; positive symptoms are psychotic or manic states that may occur in the course of the dementing illness. It is further purposed that there is a window of vulnerability to psychosis or mania that occurs relatively early in the dementing process. Consequently, advancing dementia would be expected to be associated with remission of psychosis.",

Anxiety is often a precursor to depression. Rumination is a risk factor not only for depression but also for a related range of conditions such as anxiety, substance abuse and eating disorders. Evidence for the value of low self-esteem in predicting the development of anxiety and depressive symptomatology in adolescence and emerging adulthood is inconclusive due to the complex and multifaceted relationship between self-esteem and mental health outcomes. In contrast, a parenting style that was perceived as warm and authoritative was positively associated with active coping and negatively associated with anxiety. Mood and anxiety disorders, running away, and a sense of hopelessness also increase the risk for adolescent suicide attempts. Intervention should focus on breaking the cycle of depression and negative coping and should include an analysis of cognitions and attributions.",

      "abstract": "Summary More than a cosmetic nuisance, acne can produce anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems that affect patients' lives in ways comparable to life‐threatening or disabling diseases. Emotional problems due to the disease should be taken seriously and included in the treatment plan. A purely dermatological therapy by itself may not achieve its purpose. Even mild to moderate disease can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation, and psychologic change does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. Acne patients suffer particularly under social limitations and reduced quality of life. Psychological comorbidities in acne are probably greater than generally assumed. Attention should be paid to psychosomatic aspects especially if depressive‐anxious disorders are suspected, particularly with evidence of suicidal tendencies, body dysmorphic disorders, or also in disrupted compliance.Therefore, patients who report particularly high emotional distress or dysmorphic tendencies due to the disease should be treated, if possible, by interdisciplinary therapy. The dermatologist should have some knowledge of the basics of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, which sometimes must be combined with systemic and topical treatment of acne in conjunction with basic psychosomatic treatment.",

      "abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of borderline personality disorder (BPD), beginning with the historical antecedents of the diagnosis. Next is a review of the DSM-5’s polythetic, categorical conceptualization of BPD. Currently, several dimensional and hybrid conceptualizations are under investigation. Epidemiologically, BPD has a community point prevalence between &gt;1.0 and 4.5 percent and a lifetime prevalence between 2.7 and 5.9 percent. Individuals with BPD have high rates of attempted and completed suicide and non-suicidal self-injury. Further, BPD frequently co-occurs with a number of other psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. Both genetic factors and environmental factors appear to play a role in the development of BPD. Its estimated heritability is 40 percent. Individuals with BPD may have neural abnormalities in brain regions subserving social-emotional processing and inhibitory control. Childhood adversity, neglect and trauma, and insecure and disorganized attachment styles are robust developmental risk factors for the development of adult BPD. While BPD is high risk and can be difficult to treat, most individuals with BPD in young adulthood experience significant remission of symptoms as they age. Moreover, several specialized psychosocial treatments have a promising efficacy in reducing suicidality and BPD symptoms. Finally, the chapter reviews common clinical challenges in the clinical management of BPD, followed by a framework for conducting assessment and recommending evidence-based treatment approaches.",

Of course, this usage eliminates neither illnesses nor the subjective experience of being ill, but it has implications for forensic psychiatry and for the assessment of a person’s legal responsibility. Having schizophrenic delusions constitutes a categorically different state from having only wishful illusions or a vivid imagination. In the context of medicine and psychiatry, we certainly encounter stages that signal fundamental differences. These differences are easily detected when assessing psychotic disorders or similar states, but a lot of differences also arise when assessing perpetrators with personality disorders or simply antisocial behavior. Where, in these states, are the borders that demarcate full responsibility from substantially reduced social responsibility?",

As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

Compared to the hysterical structure, schizoids more frequently show the following characteristics: they are men and have as their secondary component a mixed character structure, an earlier age of onset, a longer duration of illness but earlier referral for psychotherapy. They suffer mainly from psychic symptoms--depressive states and contact difficulties as the indicating signs. Further complaints are defective concentration, feelings of apprehension and difficulty in working, also bulimia and the inability to breathe deeply. They were mostly born between 1940 and 1959. Their relatives suffered from psychiatric disorders. Compared to the schizoids, hysterically structured individuals are almost exclusively women, their second most important structural component being obsessive-compulsive. They develop their illness later, have it for a shorter time and are referred for psychotherapy later. Their indicating signs manifest themselves more often somatically, less frequently as anxiety states or phobias. The symptoms occur simultaneously in several organ systems, particularly the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract and the musculoskeletal system. Common symptoms are dyspnea and/or hyperventilation tetany, nausea, weight gain, frigidity and fluor as well as crying fits. They formerly suffered from gynecological disorders and had to undergo operations. They were mainly born between 1920 and 1939. Their relatives had cardiac disorders and their symptoms were identical or similar to those of their father.",

Although severe, they are less handicapping than negative symptoms such as avolition or anhedonia. Positive symptoms involve the presence of things that should be absent, while negative symptoms involve the absence of things that should be present. Dimensional approaches for classifying symptoms have also become popular in current nosology, proposing three dimensions: positive, negative, and disorganized. The course of the illness evolves over time; a prodrome is often present, followed by illness onset and a variable outcome. Good outcome predictors include good premorbid adjustment, high intelligence quotient, and good social relationships. The pathophysiology of the illness includes genetic, neuropathological, and neurodevelopmental components. A possible association with creativity may suggest reasons why the illness has persisted over many centuries.",

      "abstract": "The study shows that there are two phases in the development of the human child. In the first phase the child relates almost exclusively to the mother figure. In the second phase the child is invited or forced to incorporate a third, normally the father. It demonstrates that the introduction of such a third forces a radical psychic change upon the child.\r\nNext, the study explains that schizophrenia is the result of a person not having had the opportunity or the ability to benefit from this restructuring. This absence of restructuring has many consequences, including linguistic consequences, like the inability of schizophrenic persons to understand metaphors. The study continues with the idea that the absence of the father figure does not explain some symptoms of persons afflicted by schizophrenia, like movement disorders, emotional flattening and lack of concentration.\r\nNext the study discusses the claim that medication is the remedy for schizophrenia. The author argues that medication is helpful for diminishing the burden of some symptoms. However, medication does not aim at healing the person afflicted by schizophrenia.\r\nThe study ends by reporting about the treatment of two patients.",

      "abstract": "De los muchos tipos de problemas que se presentan y que ven los profesionales de los servicios de salud mental, de dependencia química y de salud en general, ninguno supone un reto tan grande como el paciente que experimenta una alteración crónica del estado de ánimo, una adaptación social marginal, altos niveles de aislamiento interpersonal, conflicto y/o estrés diario y, con frecuencia, una conducta autodestructiva recurrente. Estos pacientes suelen recibir un diagnóstico clínico de “trastorno de la personalidad”, pero probablemente sea más apropiado describirlos como pacientes “multiproblemáticos” debido a los déficits ampliamente extendidos en su funcionamiento cognitivo, emocional, conductual y social. Estos pacientes suelen experimentar estados emocionales negativos crónicos, como depresión, ansiedad, apatía, aburrimiento, soledad, culpa e ira. Este afectividad alterada es el principal impulsor de una plétora de respuestas de afrontamiento desadaptativas: las principales son la conducta suicida repetitiva y las conductas adictivas como el abuso de alcohol/drogas, los trastornos alimentarios y/o la automutilación crónica. Los pacientes multiproblemáticos también experimentan importantes déficits en el funcionamiento social e interpersonal. Tienen problemas para formar y mantener relaciones interpersonales y a menudo introducen en el proceso terapéutico un conjunto de cuestiones conflictivas en torno a la formación y el mantenimiento de relaciones adultas, tanto superficiales como íntimas.

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "abstract": "The article lays out a theoretical analysis of the problem with diagnosing apathy in today's research. Apathy is a state characterized by a simultaneous decrease in the behavioral, cognitive and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior due to loss of motivation [15]. Behavioral changes lie in a declining everyday problem-solving effectiveness at home or work. Cognitive changes result in reduced cognitive functioning and a lack of plans and life strategies. Emotional changes manifest in a decrease in affective response to events that previously elicited either a positive or negative emotional response. Diagnostic criteria, or the 'gold standard' for apathy, identify behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social symptoms of apathy that cause clinically significant disorders in personal, social, professional, or other important areas of life. The differential diagnosis of apathy involves its clinical distinction from syndromes such as delirium, dementia, depression, abulia, akinesia, and demoralization. The review can be useful for psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and all practitioners who interact with people at risk of developing apathetic states.",

This syndrome can be differentiated from depression and is recognizable in palliative care settings. It is associated with chronic medical illness, disability, bodily disfigurement, fear of loss of dignity, social isolation, and--where there is a subjective sense of incompetence--feelings of greater dependency on others or the perception of being a burden. Because of the sense of impotence or helplessness, those with the syndrome predictably progress to a desire to die or to commit suicide. A treatment approach is described which has the potential to alleviate the distress caused by this syndrome. Overall, demoralization syndrome has satisfactory face, descriptive, predictive, construct, and divergent validity, suggesting its utility as a diagnostic category in palliative care.",

      "title": "Resilience and Reducing Self-Destructive Behaviors",
      "abstract": "Recent developments in positive psychology underscore the potential benefit of focusing on resilience factors rather than psychiatric illness or symptoms. Resilience can be defined as a set of qualities that can be multidimensional and enable an individual to persevere through adversity. Both internal and external stressors are constant in a person’s life and one’s ability to cope affects their resilience. Sometimes, one’s ability to cope is unsuccessful and can result in self-destructive behaviors. Obtaining information on risk factors is important in identifying personal and environmental issues that contribute to self-destructive behaviors. These behaviors have been described as wide-ranging acts of harm to self, including suicidal behaviors, nonsuicidal self-injury, and recklessness. Direct and indirect subtypes of self-destructive behaviors are important to understand and will be explored. Past and childhood trauma is known to be a strong predictor of self-harming behavior into adulthood. Further, post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses are strongly correlated with prevalence of suicide attempts. The literature indicates that other risk factors include psychiatric illness, socioeconomic disadvantages, early and late adulthood, sexual orientation, and military/veteran status. Additionally, self-harming behavior is a predictor for suicide attempts, with a suicide completion rate of 5% for up to 9 years after hospitalization for self-harm. Research shows that adolescents, military/veteran, and ethnically and sexually diverse populations are most at risk. Several cultural aspects within these groups will be explored to show potential protective factors which can be applied to the individual. It is important to understand the factors that relate to resilience in dealing with negative effects of trauma and stress, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental illness. Successful evidence-based resilience programs within each of these at-risk groups will be discussed along with implications for further research.",

      "title": "Pseudoneurotic Symptoms in the Schizophrenia Spectrum: A Longitudinal Study of Their Relation to Psychopathology and Clinical Outcomes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Hypothesis Nonpsychotic symptoms (depression, anxiety, obsessions, etc.) are frequent in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and are usually conceptualized as comorbidity or transdiagnostic symptoms. However, in twentieth century foundational psychopathological literature, many nonpsychotic symptoms with specific phenomenology (here termed pseudoneurotic symptoms) were considered relatively typical of schizophrenia. In this prospective study, we investigated potential associations of pseudoneurotic symptoms with diagnostic status, functional outcome as well as psychopathological dimensions of schizophrenia. Study Design First-admitted patients (N = 121) diagnosed with non-affective psychosis, schizotypal disorder, or other mental illness were examined at initial hospitalization and 5 years later with a comprehensive assessment of psychopathology. Informed by the literature, we constructed scales targeting pseudoneurotic symptoms and other, more general, nonpsychotic symptoms. Study Results Pseudoneurotic symptoms aggregated in schizophrenia-spectrum groups compared to other mental illnesses and occurred at similar levels at baseline and follow-up. They longitudinally predicted poorer social and occupational functioning in schizophrenia-spectrum patients over a 5-year-period but not transition to schizophrenia-spectrum disorders from other mental illnesses. Finally, the level of pseudoneurotic symptoms correlated with disorder of basic self at both assessments and with positive and negative symptoms at follow-up. The scale targeting general nonpsychotic symptoms did not show this pattern of associations. Conclusions The study supports that a group of nonpsychotic symptoms, ie, pseudoneurotic symptoms, are associated with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and linked with temporally stable psychopathology, particularly disorder of the basic self. Their prospective association with social and occupational functioning needs replication.",

Research in social cognition in schizophrenia has tended to cluster around four types of social cognitive processes: emotion processing, social perception, attributional style, and mental state attribution. Neurocognitive and social cognitive tasks often share cognitive demands, such as working memory and perception. Negative symptoms reflect a decrease or absence of normal functions within two broad domains: internal experience-related impairments, including diminished emotional experience, motivation to engage in productive activities, and desire for social affiliation; expressive or communicative impairments, including diminished facial expressivity, gestures, prosody, and speech production. It has been known for a long time that, neurocognition, negative symptoms are consistent predictors of daily functioning.",

      "abstract": "Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by new or worsening changes in mental health, cognition, or physical function that persist following critical illness. The psychiatric domain of PICS encompasses new or worsened psychiatric burdens following critical illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Many of the established predisposing and precipitating factors for the psychiatric domain of PICS are commonly found in the setting of critical illness, including mechanical ventilation (MV), exposure to sedating medications, and physical restraint. Importantly, previous psychiatric history is a strong risk factor for the development of the psychiatric domain of PICS and should be considered when screening patients to diagnose psychiatric impairment and interventions. Delirium has been associated with psychiatric symptoms following ICU admission, therefore prevention warrants careful consideration. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to have the lowest risk for development of delirium when compared to other sedatives and has been the only sedative studied in relation to the psychiatric domain of PICS. Nocturnal dexmedetomidine and intensive care unit (ICU) diaries have been associated with decreased psychiatric burden after ICU discharge. Studies evaluating the impact of other intra-ICU practices on the development of the psychiatric domain of PICS, including the ABCDEF bundle, depth of sedation, and daily spontaneous awakening trials, have been limited and inconclusive. The psychiatric domain of PICS is difficult to treat and may be less responsive to multidisciplinary post-discharge programs and targeted interventions than the cognitive and physical domains of PICS. Given the high morbidity associated with the psychiatric domain of PICS, intensivists should familiarize themselves with the risk factors and intra-ICU interventions that can mitigate this important and under-recognized condition.",

Cognitive vulnerability includes not only appraisals of events and circumstances that emphasize personal unworthiness and incompetence, but also underlying beliefs and “working models” of the self and others. Such cognitions arise in part in the context of maladaptive attachment relations with the parents and may be reinforced by interpersonal incompetencies and difficulties in peer, family, and social relationships. Stressful conditions in early life and throughout development may undermine or erode the development of effective coping competencies. Moreover, maladaptive cognitions about the self and others, and ineffective coping competencies, may contribute to the occurrence of stressful events and circumstances —and these in turn may trigger depressive reactions. For many depressed people with chronic or recurrent depression, therefore, developmental processes play critical roles in the origin and continuation of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "Psychosomatic disorders in children and adolescents is a topic that covers a wide variety of illnesses and one which is difficult if not impossible to define accurately. In general, chronic emotional states, often nonspecific, serve as strong contributors to the development of a physical illness. The particular illness is often dictated by varying degrees of biological predisposition in one physiological system—i.e., such a predisposition in the respiratory system may lead to asthma or in the gastrointestinal system to ulcerative colitis. In some cases the biological factor is large and the emotional factor minimal, while in other cases the reverse is true. In the early days of research in psychosomatic disorders it was widely believed that each disorder was accompanied by certain specific emotional problems. Further study has shown this is not true. It was also felt that many, if not most of these disorders could be cured by psychotherapy, and this also has proven to be a fallacy. We have moved more and more to the team approach. Since both psyche and soma are involved, more than one specialist is usually required. In children and adolescents this may involve a child psychiatrist, a pediatrician, an allergist or gastroenterologist, a social worker and a psychologist. It requires time and patience to form an effective and smoothly functioning team in which all members respect one another's potential contribution. Some examples of team operation are presented and some of the problems outlined. In addition, there is attention given to the special problems of the adolescent and also the child with chronic nonspecific physical complaints as well as the child who requires hospitalization.",

We proposed diagnostic criteria and then performed a study of the psychiatric profiles of outpatients with psychogenic excoriations and the circumstances around the creation of these excoriations. Although the results must be interpreted with caution because the study was performed with only 10 patients, interesting data is provided about the onset of psychogenic excoriations, the behaviour of picking, and comorbidity. Common or specific characteristics were identified according to type of case. The majority of patients associated first excoriations with personal problems. Four patients reported abuse in childhood or adolescence. This study confirms that skin picking is an impulsive reaction and does not belong to the obsessive-compulsive disorders: impulsivity is defined by ineffective or failing control resulting in uninhibited behaviour.",

      "title": "Lack of Insight in Bipolar Disorder: The Impact on Treatment Adherence, Adverse Clinical Outcomes and Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Insight is a multidimensional construct, defined as the awareness of having a mental disorder, of specific symptoms and their attribution to the disorder, the awareness of social consequences, and of need for treatment. Although insight has been studied specifically in schizophrenia and its study in mood disorders has traditionally received limited attention, the evaluation of this concept in mood disorders is also very important because of the impact on treatment compliance and outcome. In bipolar disorder (BD), clinical insight varies substantially over time. Most researchers observed that insight is more impaired during an illness episode than during remission, in mixed than in pure manic episodes, in bipolar II than in bipolar I patients, and in pure mania than in bipolar or unipolar depression. Lack of insight is a consistent factor of non-adherence to medication in bipolar patients, along with severity of BD, side effects of medication, effectiveness, and patient-related factors. Also, impaired insight into treatment and a great number of previous hospitalizations are associated with poorer clinical outcomes (psychiatric hospitalization, emergency room visits, violent or suicidal behavior) among the patients with bipolar I disorder. In the management of bipolar disorder, improving quality of life (QoL) and outcome should be one the most important goals.",

      "title": "First-rank symptoms in Bipolar disorder",
      "abstract": "Despite their description as characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia, first-rank symptoms (FRS) are also seen in other conditions.[1] The prevalence of FRS was 70% in schizophrenia, 29% in psychotic bipolar disorder, and 18% in psychotic depression.[2] Manic hyperactivity may at times be confused with psychotic agitation and excitement. Amidst debate on the diagnostic utility of FRS, they continue to be relevant from prognostication and treatment planning point of view.[3] The presence of FRS in bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) may be predictor of poor short-term outcome and decompensating the course of illness.[4] BPAD patients with mania or mixed episodes are more likely to be females. Younger patients had a higher prevalence of FRS.[5] The presence of FRS in psychiatric illness is associated with poor long-term residential status and poorer psychosocial functioning.[6] We present a case of bipolar affective disorder who at presentation had florid psychotic symptoms with FRS. A 19-year-old female, BA LLB student, with no family history of psychiatric illness, premorbidly stable extrovert with past history of an insidious onset gradually progressive persistent and pervasive depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, reduced concentration and attention, reduced self-esteem and self-confidence, disturbed sleep and diminished appetite in September 2019 remitted gradually without treatment over 3–4 months. She manifested in November 2020 with acute onset and progressive elevated and expansive mood, increased physical restlessness, and over-talkativeness. She was suspicious as she was unable to upload video on Instagram and believed that unknown people are jealous of her celebrity status and has hacking her mobile and network. General physical and systemic examinations were within normal limits. Mental status examination revealed her to be well-groomed, wearing colorful clothes with matching mask, and nail polish. She entered the chamber without seeking permission with air of confidence around her. She briskly shook the hand with examiner and sat on chair without asking as if in casual conversation. She was suspicious that the wall clock had monitoring device and there was someone behind the curtain. She was easily distractible by people entering the room. She was over-familiar, jocular, distractible, and had increased motor activity. She had elated affect, flight of ideas, delusion of grandiosity and persecution, intermittent auditory hallucination giving a running commentary on her action, ill sustained concentration, impaired judgment and insight, and decreased need for sleep and increased energy. Her hematological, biochemical parameters (including thyroid profile), and NCCT head were within normal limits. Young Mania Rating Scale score was 32/60, suggestive of moderate mania. Rorschach psychodiagnostic test revealed an increased number of responses, decreased initial and total reaction time, high number of color, sexual, and movement responses. New and additional responses in inquiry were suggestive of mania. She was provisionally diagnosed as a case of bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms. She was started on tablet risperidone 2 mg/day and tablet lithium 900 mg/day. Psychoeducation about the illness and relapse prevention was taught to which she responded well. Schizophrenia is often difficult to diagnose, and it is important not to give a label of Schizophrenia to those who do not suffer from it.[7] In the index case, there was a diagnostic dilemma in view of the initial presentation with widespread persecutory delusions obscuring the disturbance of affect. The presence of FRS further complicated the clinical picture. However, history suggestive of a depressive episode which remitted without medications over 4 months compelled us to consider a diagnosis of BPAD with psychotic symptoms as more likely. She responded well to antipsychotic and mood stabilizer and supportive psychotherapy with improvement in mood, social and academic functioning. The index case underscores the importance of being aware of overlapping nature of symptoms in various psychiatric disorders, the need for close serial monitoring of patients for evolution of new symptoms of changing psychopathology and the utility of Rorschach psychodiagnostic test in difficult cases.

      "abstract": "Kleptomania is the inability to refrain from the urge to steal items for reasons other than personal use or financial gain. The disorder is frequently under-diagnosed and is regularly accompanied by other psychiatric disorders; particularly anxiety disorders, eating disorders and affective disorders. Our patient is a 19-year-old female, who was referred to our hospital from a general state hospital. She suffered from a desire to steal things such as makeup materials and perfume. She also complained carrying out inappropriate sexual behavior. She had depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and attempted suicide three times in past years. She knew her grandmother as her mother, despite living in the same household. According to classical psychoanalytical theory; kleptomania is a defense against unconscious impulses, desires, conflicts and needs. The individual who is prone to narcissistic injury tries to prevent the self from disintegrating by the way of stealing behavior. Among psychodynamic theories, ego psychology, self-psychology and object relations theory also have explanations for kleptomania. This case has symptoms that belong to other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the case presented here is important for its emphasis on the fact that categorical and symptom oriented approaches are far from considering patients as a whole.",

It is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases with different clinical manifestations, genetic component and anatomopathological alteration. It´s psychiatric symptoms have an insidious onset, with personality deterioration and progressive affectation of behavior. Usually these changes occur before finding abnormalities in neuroimaging studies, their characteristics depend on the location of the cerebral lesions and usually are precede or mask by cognitive disabilities. Apathy and lack of volition are common initial symptoms and occurs in most patients as the disease progresses. Disinhibition is manifested by inappropriate social behaviors such as inadequate laughter, exhibitionism, restless, impulses, uncontrolled sexuality and violence, inappropriate jocularity and childish humor; that symptoms can be present in a half of patients. CASE REPORT: A representative case report was considered in which the first manifestation of dementia is a syndrome with manic features. Also, specific literature published to date is reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Is required a correct differential diagnosis between dementia and the beginning of a late onset bipolar affective disorder, and complementary examinations can be useful for this purpose.",

      "title": "ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD): BEHAVIORAL AND GENETIC ASPECTS",
      "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) occurs during neurodevelopment, being more common in childhood and adolescence, but can last until adulthood. It is usually associated with symptoms involving family and school problems, negative psychological outcomes with increased risk for personality disorders, and psychotics. Indistinctly, they may present symptoms of inattention, while in others there is a predominance of impulsiveness and restlessness. The diagnosis is usually made in childhood, and it is difficult to validate before the age of five because it presents signs that are still nonspecific. There is a tendency for hyperactivity and compulsiveness to decrease in adolescence, although inattention persists. Language and learning problems are considered as common comorbidities for ADHD at this stage. In adults, the difficulty in diagnosis is recurrent due to the non-recognition of the problem, often due to the confusion of symptoms with personality failure due to emotional complaints. ADHD is considered a multifactorial and heterogeneous disorder, with hereditary and environmental contributions that interfere with neurodevelopment. There are strong indications of genetic contribution of this condition, between 70 – 80% heritability. Molecular studies of association of candidate genes and meta-analysis indicate the participation of the dopamine receptor genes (D4 and D5), in addition to the COMT gene, which encodes the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase, responsible for the degradation of catecholamines. Epigenetic patterns of methylation of dopaminergic, serotonergic, neurotrophic, and nerve growth factor receptor genes seem to be associated with different symptoms and severity of ADHD. The diagnosis is strictly clinical, based on the behavioral symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders of genetic and environmental etiologies. Some ASD cases are syndromic: associated with clinically defined patterns of somatic abnormalities and a neurobehavioral phenotype (e.g., Fragile X syndrome). Many cases, however, are idiopathic or non-syndromic. Such disorders present themselves during the early postnatal period when language, speech, and personality start to develop. ASDs manifest by deficits in social communication and interaction, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior across multiple contexts, sensory abnormalities across multiple modalities and comorbidities, such as epilepsy among many others. ASDs are disorders of connectivity, as synaptic dysfunction is common to both syndromic and idiopathic forms. While multiple theories have been proposed, particularly in idiopathic ASDs, none address why certain brain areas (e.g., frontotemporal) appear more vulnerable than others or identify factors that may affect phenotypic specificity. In this hypothesis article, we identify possible routes leading to, and the consequences of, altered connectivity and review the evidence of central and peripheral synaptic dysfunction in ASDs. We postulate that phenotypic specificity could arise from aberrant experience-dependent plasticity mechanisms in frontal brain areas and peripheral sensory networks and propose why the vulnerability of these areas could be part of a model to unify preexisting pathophysiological theories.",

      "title": "HYPERTHYROIDISM AND PSYCHOBIOLOGICAL REACTIONS",
      "abstract": "An attempt was made to estimate the significance of more or less marked hyperthyroidism in 70 psychoneurotic and psychotic patients. Two problems were discussed: (a) The rôle of hyperthyroidism in the etiology and pathogenesis of psychoses; (b) The correlation between psychobiological reactions, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, and hyperthyroid function. Our material suggests the following: 1. Hyperthyroidism may coincide with various types of actual psychoses; thyrotoxicosis is apt to cause mental reactions which are not essentially different from those commonly present in many other toxic and infectious conditions. 2. In some of our psychotic patients the hyperthyroid function appeared to play a rôle as a causative, precipitating, or aggravating factor. In other patients, hyperthyroidism did not seem to have any bearing on the origin, course, and recurrence of various types of psychoses. 3. Studies of life histories of patients, having symptoms of dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and of hyperthyroidism, bring out the presence of more or less serious psychobiological implications. Such studies strongly suggest, first, that there is a close interrelationship between the psychobiological implications and the malfunction of both the thyroid gland and the autonomic nervous system; second, that these pathologic manifestations have a common origin which may be traced to a combination of personality background (including a predisposition to hyperthyroidism) and injurious situational conditions. 4. In the discussion of the differential diagnosis between dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and hyperthyroidism, it was pointed out that both persistent tachycardia and high basal metabolic rate, considered to be characteristic of hyperthyroidism, may also be present in conditions in which the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system appears to be the essential factor. 5. Granting that hyperthyroidism is not exclusively a thyroidal disease, its treatment in every case necessitates a consideration of medical and psychiatric aspects before surgical intervention is considered. 6. Thyroidectomy is regarded as a treatment measure which may or may not have an influence on the general personality background; it, therefore, should always be supplemented by treatment of the patient's total personality and the situation in which hyperthyroidism has developed.",

However, the extent to which HPA axis dysfunction precedes illness onset is currently unclear . Whilst elevated diurnal cortisol levels have been reported in samples of youth at ultra high-risk for psychosis, such elevations may relate to distress associated with emerging illness and might also be influenced by psychotropic medication . Further- more, studies of high-risk individuals with a family history of illness have typically included adult relatives who have passed the peak age of illness onset . As yet, no study of high-risk youth has examined the CAR or the extent to which HPA axis dysfunction is associated with neurocognitive performance . The current study aimed to determine whether children at putatively elevated risk for schizophrenia who present psychotic-like experiences and other antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz) and high-risk children with a family history of illness (FHx) are characterised by abnormal HPA axis function relative to their typically-developing (TD) peers . A further aim was to examine associations between HPA axis function and performance on tasks of memory and executive function among ASz and FHx children .",

      "title": "Early Maladaptive Schemas as Stress and Emerging Mental Pathology “Moderators",
      "abstract": "The article presents an overview of researches aimed at studying the consequences of the traumatic childhood experience and not satisfied basic psychological needs. The emerging maladaptive schemas are considered the “moderators” in the association with stress and psychopathology. The emerging maladaptive schema is a stable pattern consisting of memories, emotions, knowledge and perceptions regarding oneself and relationships with other people. The main distinguishing features of emerging maladaptive schemes are: first, dysfunctional experiences that arise as a result of a child's interaction in the communication process with family members; second, perception of schemes as factual knowledge about themselves and surrounding reality; third, activation by external factors. The research data on the relationship between emerging maladaptive schemas and various categories of mental disorders are presented. The relationship of different schemas with various types of fears is described. It has been shown that the frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders is higher in people with ineffective emotional schemas. This is due to the fact that a maladaptive schema causes a person to misunderstand his emotions or interpret them negatively. The features of maladaptive schemas in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders and schizophrenic spectrum disorders were revealed too. The emerging maladaptive schemas negatively affect mental health and well-being of an individual, his interpersonal relationships, and the ways of emotional response, which determines the need for therapy. Special attention is given to the researches of maladaptive schemas in adolescence with the prospect of their correction and mental status stabilization. In general, there are few studies concerning the identification of emerging maladaptive schemas in adolescents, and they show only the relationship of emerging maladaptive schemas with individual psychological characteristics. Considering that during life the maladaptive schemas become more complex and affect an increasing number of functioning areas, it seems appropriate to identify these schemas at young age, when they do not have a clear structure, are not rigid and do not cause persistent maladjustment in all spheres of functioning. However, until now, in studies of the adolescent population the aspects of studying the role of maladaptive schemas as a link between the traumatic childhood experience, problem parent-child relationships and emerging psychopathology had not been sufficiently studied. In comparison with adults, psychotherapeutic and psycho-corrective tactics of working with activated maladaptive schemes in adolescents have been developed to a lesser extent.",

Dalam perjalanan penyakitnya, penderita skizofrenia seringkali mengalami relaps setelah selesai menjalani masa perawatan baik di rumah sakit maupun pengobatan non medis. Tujuan penelitian untuk mengetahui penyebab relaps pada pasien skizofrenia. Jenis penelitian yang digunakan adalah penelitian kualitatif dengan teknik pengumpulan data berupa wawancara semi terstruktur. Adapun subjek dalam penelitian ini berjumlah tiga orang yaitu pasien skizofrenia yang dirawat di rumah sakit jiwa dan pernah dinyatakan sembuh kemudian mengalami relaps dan harus kembali menjalani rawat inap di rumah sakit jiwa yang sama. Analisa data dalam penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan triangulasi sumber. Hasil yang didapat dari penelitian ini bahwa terdapat beberapa hal yang menjadi peyebab relaps pada pasien skizofrenia yaitu faktor ekonomi, ketidakpatuhan pasien pada pengobatan, mendapat perlakuan kasar dan pertengkaran yang terus menerus dengan saudara kandung, konflik yang berkepanjangan dengan istri, dan emosi (marah) yang diekspresikan secara berlebihan oleh keluarga. Kata kunci : Skizofrenia, Relaps Schizophrenia patient who withdraws from others and reality often comes into life of fantasy that is full delusion and hallucination. In process of experiencing the disease, patient schizophrenia often relapse after completed treatment either in hospital medical therapy or non medical therapy. This study attempted to know the caution of relapse at schizophrenia patient.The type of research is qualitative research, and the data collected in the form of semi-structured interviews.The subject in this research were three former inpatient schizophrenia in mental hospital who experience relapse and must return to the same hospital to get treatment anymore. Analyzing the data used qualitative methods with triangulation sources. The results showed that there are some things becoming cause relapse at patient schizophrenia. It comprised economic factor, disobedience of patient at therapy, gets continuous upstaging and quarrel with sibling, endless conflict with wife, depressed because of a desire to marry is not reached, and receive excessive emotion (angry) from their family.

      "abstract": "Three major components have been repeatedly implicated for the origin(s) of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): system, minor sickness and surroundings. All these factors also frame infant temperament, and therefore it seems logical to suppose that the babies who either succumb to or are at risk of SIDS may present with certain behavioural features. The infants who have died of SIDS moved less when lying awake in the crib, during feeding and during nail cutting; less often turned their head away and looked for their mother when held by a new person; were more frequently reported to show an extreme response (either almost never protested or almost always objected) when approached by someone other than main caregiver; and exhibited extreme behavioural patterns when the infant’s vocalising on waking up was studied. The infants who died of SIDS had lower activity scores. An unfavourable microenvironment can increase the risk of SIDS, and the babies facing less developmental stimulation had a more negative mood and were less distractible; less organised infants presented with a more negative mood, less distractible behaviour, lower rhythmicity, lower persistence and lower adaptability. The infants born to smoking mothers who are at risk of SIDS had more intensive reactions. The low‐birth‐weight infants who are at high risk of SIDS were more withdrawing and less adaptable. Infant–parent(s) bed sharing may increase the risk of SIDS, and solitary sleeping infants had a more positive mood and were more persistent. Use of a pacifier may be protective against SIDS, and pacifier users presented with higher rhythmicity. Prone sleep is known to increase the risk of SIDS, and the lowest persistence was a feature of those babies who were usually put to sleep supine and found prone. Infants who snored and/or had noisy breathing in sleep were characterised by more negative mood. Infants with signs of repetitive regurgitation were less distractible.",

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

It is suggested that the concept of intentionality of thought and action be examined in these patients to distinguish obsessionals with core conflicts that are primarily neurotic and triadic, from those with more significant, earlier difficulty in the oral period. The concept of intentionality is related to self-object distinction, the use of projections, the sense of self, pathologic ego-superego condensation, and the existence of the ability to tolerate and recognize aggressiveness within. More accurate and rapid diagnostic distinction among obsessionals has implications for different treatment approaches.",

      "title": "Neurobiology of emotional trauma",
      "abstract": "An emotional trauma may induce a cascade of neurobiological events that have long-lasting consequences even altered gene expression. Early abuse and neglect can deregulate the child's developing neurobiological system by reducing its resistance to stressful events, leading to later problems of emotional regulation. Children who have been subjected to physical or emotional abuse tend to pay more attention to signs that contain anger and are hypersensitive to threat. Scar hypothesis and the theories of behavioural sensitization or electrophysiological kindling suggest that emotional traumas may leave traces that persist even after remission of depression, and render individuals vulnerable to the onset of new episodes, even under the influence of only moderate psychosocial stress. Unfavorable early social experiences, such as emotional abuse or institutionalization can affect the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex. Exposure to repeated emotional stressors, even in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses, has been shown to produce increased synapse formation and dendritic growth in basolateral amygdala, dendritic retraction in the hippocampus, and anxiety-like behavior against specific triggers, such as phobia of open spaces. During the narration of an emotionally traumatic event, there is activation of the limbic system, the right amygdale, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, there is an activation of the anterior insula, which records the physical impact of negative emotions, and the anterior and medial temporal cortex, which are involved in negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD patients have found hypoactivity in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate and thalamic areas, indicating the effects of PTSD on executive function, attention and cognitive, memorial, and affective and somatosensory integration. One of the most replicated findings in studies involving PTSD patients is the decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found a negative correlation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation. A recent meta-analysis revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and emotional trauma and suggested that global brain volume reductions can distinguish PTSD from major depression. Neuroimaging studies of successful eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment have consistently shown that patients exhibited increased frontal lobe activation. Moving beyond diagnostic boundaries, focusing on the causal interplay between specific traumatic processes and using standardized measures, are useful directions for future research in memory, emotion and emotional trauma.",

In order to be diagnosed with autism, the behavioural symptoms in all of the above-named areas must be present by age 3. Even if the parents often notice that something is wrong during infancy, it is very difficult to diagnose autism before the age of eighteen months. This is because the behavioural symptoms used to establish the diagnosis have not clearly emerged developmentally until that age. The majority of children with autism also have a learning disability (mental retardation), although a few have average intelligence. Many also have epilepsy, and visual and hearing impairment are over-represented in this group. Persons with Asperger’s syndrome, which is a condition resembling autism, have average or above average intelligence. Roughly estimated, 1 - 2 children per thousand have autism, which means that about one hundred children are born with autism every year in Sweden. Autism and the other pervasive developmental disorders (autistic-like conditions), or in other words the entire autism spectrum, adds up to at least 6 children in every thousand in Sweden. The same figures are seen in other nations worldwide. Many more boys than girls have autism.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Progressive Resistance Training for theChildren with Spastic Diplegic Cerebral Palsy: A ControlledExperimental study",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION :\r\nCerebral Palsy (CP) is defined as a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal (or) infant brain. The motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication and behaviour by epilepsy and\r\nsecondary musculoskeletal problems. The incidence of CP is well raised above 2.0 per 1,000 live birth in the past 40 years. The Fetal brain injury that occurs during the prenatal, postnatal and neonatal period ends up in CP. The causes can be specified as: intra uterine exposure to infection, inflammation, disorders of coagulation, interruption of oxygen supply during birth, low APGAR score, seizures, low birth weight, pre term and non specific indicators of neonatal illness.\r\nCP can be classified based on the movements as hypertonic or spastic, ataxic, dyskinetic, mixed and hypotonic6. Based on the function, CP is classified as quadriplegic, diplegic, hemiplegic and monoplegic7. Spasticity is the most common movement disorder among the patients with CP 8. Spastic diplegia is most prevalent form of CP.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY :\r\nThe study was aimed to find out the effect of PRE training on the functional out come in the spastic diplegic CP children.\r\nOBJECTIVES :\r\n1. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the gross motor function in the experimental group.\r\n2. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the gross motor function in the control group.\r\n3. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the mobility function in the experimental group.\r\n4. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the mobility function in the control group.\r\n5. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the strength in the experimental group.\r\n6. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the strength in the control group.\r\n7. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the spasticity in the experimental group.\r\n8. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the spasticity in the control group.\r\n9. To compare the gross motor functional outcome difference between the experimental and control group.\r\n10. To compare mobility functional outcome difference between the experimental and control group.\r\n11. To compare the strength gain between the experimental and control group.\r\n12. To compare the change in spasticity between the experimental and control group.\r\nMETHODOLOGY :\r\nStudy Design :\r\nA controlled Experimental study.\r\nStudy Setting :\r\nPhysiotherapy Outpatient Department, and Pediatric Inpatient\r\nDepartment of Sri Ramakrishna Multi Specialty Hospital, Coimbatore.\r\nSampling Technique : A Convenience sampling.\r\nSample Size :\r\nA total of 30 spastic diplegic CP children was selected on the basis of the selection criteria and conveniently allocated in two groups. The group A (experimental group) consist of 15 children and the other group B (control group)consist of 15 children.\r\nStudy Duration :\r\nThe study was conducted over a period of 1 year.\r\nTreatment Duration :\r\nThe treatment duration was 12 weeks.\r\nSelection Criteria :\r\na) Inclusion criteria :\r\n• Age: 4-10 years.\r\n• Both gender.\r\n• Able to accept and follow verbal instructions.\r\n• Ability to walk independently in indoors and outdoors with (or) without mobility aids.\r\n• Children with spastic diplegic CP under the Gross Motor\r\nFunctional Classification System (GMFCS) level I-III.\r\nb) Exclusion criteria :\r\n• Unstable seizures.\r\n• Any surgical procedures up to 3 months prior to the study.\r\n• Botulium toxin injection up to 6 months prior to the study.\r\n• Other cardio vascular and pulmonary disease which interferes the resisted training exercise.\r\nRESULTS :\r\nThe results confirmed the effect of PRE training was effective than the conventional therapy in the improvement of the gross motor function, mobility function and strength without the adverse effects of increasing spasticity. The result supported the previous studies which stated the PRE can improve the functional status without the adverse effect. Result of the study showed the relationship with the muscle strength and gross motor function25. The study determined that there was significant strength gain in the muscle targeted in the lower limbs, which was also stated in the other studies showed the direct relationship between the lower limb muscle strength and gait parameters. The gained strength of the lower limb muscles can improve the function by strengthened hip muscle stabilizing the pelvic motions in walking, the strengthened knee muscle can improved the degree of crouch gait and increased fast walking, the strengthened ankle muscle can improve the propulsive action of the foot in terminal stands phase34, decreased energy consumption by normalizing the abnormal joint position, and cardiovascular fitness gained after the PRE training36. All these factors contributed for the improvement in the gait parameters such as increased speed, increased stride length, increased cadence and increased single limb balancing during walking.\r\nCONCLUSION :\r\nThe study confirmed the effect of PRE training in the\r\nfunctional status of the spastic diplegic CP who are ambulating. The result of the study showed that the PRE for spastic dipelgic CP can increase the strength of the muscle thus improve gross motor function and mobility without the adverse effect of increased muscle tone.",

Background Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and chronic mental illnesses characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking and of emotional responsiveness.1 It most commonly manifests as hallucinations, paranoid, bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking as well as significant social or occupational dysfunction.2, 3 Schizophrenia affects about 24 million people worldwide.2 It is among the top 10 causes of disability-adjusted life year globally.4 Likewise, impairments of cognition, language, motor development, and social behaviour impact to patients' lifestyle, sense of well being and satisfaction reflecting to their QoL (quality of life).5 Thus, the patients with schizophrenia require help and care from others.6 In addition, in many countries, current mental health care policy focuses on encouraging patients with schizophrenia or mental illness to return to the community to live with their family. Consequently, the families of patients with schizophrenia are often required to play the major role of taking responsibility for caring these patients.7 Care activities for patients with schizophrenia are difficult, often long-term responsibilities of the families. Hence, the families are confronted with a challenging situation8 in order to balance between providing good care for their relative with schizophrenia, others members in their family as well as themselves. In this way, families have many tasks such as ensuring that the patients take prescribed medications, get sufficient food and sleep, conducting other daily living activities, as well as preventing them from potentially dangerous behaviour.9 The families are also confronted with additional problems including financial problems and worry about the general health and recurrence of illness of the patients in addition to management of the patient's behaviour.9,10 Meanwhile, the families have to take other roles in their life and family, including financial, employment, social life, physical health, marital and family relationships, and daily household activities. Families' lives may be disrupted by providing more care activities than would normally be anticipated.9 As stated, care activities for patients with schizophrenia may have a significant impact on all aspects of individual lives as well as the entire family system and this may have a dysfunctional impact on the family.9,10,11,12 The difficulties experienced by the families of patients with schizophrenia can be categorized into objective and subjective problems. The objective problems refer to practical problems such as disruptions in family functioning and relationships, constraints in social, work and leisure activities, general health disturbances, and financial problems. The subjective problems refer to the psychological reactions of the families such as stress, burden, feeling of shame, loss, guilt, anger, depression, anxiety, embarrassment in social situation, and stigma.13 Both objective and subjective problems impact on health and functioning of the families of patients with schizophrenia. These are associated with reduced quality of life.14 However, overcoming difficulties in care-giving can provide a sense of inner strength and satisfaction as major life challenges to the families of patients with schizophrenia.15 Thus, there are also some positive experiences of living with schizophrenia patients such as feelings of worth and achievement, a closer relationship with the patient10, fulfillment of parental duties and self-knowledge.16 These positive experiences can assist families to accept their caring role.10 Therefore, experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia reflect special issues and problems within the family that impact on their own quality of life as well as the quality of care. Families express a need for both physical and emotional support in order to care and cope effectively with patients with schizophrenia.8,10,17 It appears essential to raise awareness of the plight of families of patients with schizophrenia so that they are able to receive suitable support according to their different service needs. It is important and necessary for health care providers or mental health professionals such as nurses to know and understand the experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes, needs, coping and overcoming obstacles. This information and knowledge will help health care providers or mental health professionals to develop appropriate interventions that aim to help solve problems and serve the needs of the family of patients with schizophrenia.18 Caregiving experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia can be studied in a holistic and meaningful manner by using qualitative approaches. For example, a study of families from a metropolitan area in a south eastern state in the USA explored the experiences of 26 families who were living with a patient with schizophrenia.19 Those families volunteered to complete the questionnaire known as the descriptive from of the instrument which measures the psychosocial variables including family coping behaviours, family psychological distress, family social support, and patient behavioural problems that influence on family functioning in families providing care for a family member with schizophrenia. Through the written descriptive data, the reactions, experiences, and perceptions of those families yielded the value issues of caregiving experiences of families living with schizophrenia. Researchers independently generated lists of categories of those written answers. Themes were identified and agreed upon through an interpretive lens. In addition, the findings were sent to the participants to confirm the findings. The results showed the feelings, issues, and concerns of providing care for a family member with schizophrenia as five themes: 1) overwhelming feelings, 2) importance of medication, 3) legal system difficulties, 4) family and friends, and 5) mental health professionals.19 Another study explored the caring experiences of 10 carers who are family members lived with someone with long-term schizophrenia, within the cultural context of Taiwan.10 The carers were interviewed face-to-face followed the semi-structured interview guide. They were encouraged to express or share their feelings and perceptions about their caring experience. Then, field notes and transcripts from tape recorders were analysed through phenomenological approach. The results showed three themes including 1) burdens of caring, 2) emotional burdens, and 3) strategies of coping.10 Furthermore, there are other qualitative studies which focus on caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia that indicated the similar results such as tasks or care activities that families must do, negative or sometime positive feeling toward patients, burden20,21,22,23,24 coping or ways that families used to manage the difficult situation25, needs of families as well as help seeking behaviours24 for support them. However, there appears to be a deficit of systematic reviews on the caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia. There was only one systematic review on the needs of family caregivers of a person with depression that indicates the caregivers are not prepared for the impact of the illness and that they need information about the development of depression, training in communication skills, and understanding on the importance of antidepressants in controlling the disease.26 There is no previously conducted systematic review on to determine the meaningfulness of caregiving experiences of families living with patients with schizophrenia. This systematic review, therefore, aims to synthesis research findings concerning the subjective caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia. It will help health care providers or mental health professionals to know and understand the experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. The outcomes of the review may serve as basis information for public health guidelines or frameworks which aim to promote quality of life and quality of care for the family of patients with schizophrenia. The overall aim is to increase quality of life of patients with schizophrenia. The Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Library database and CINAHL database have been searched and no previous systematic reviews on this specific topic were identified as published or underway. Inclusion criteria Types of participants The review will consider studies that include the family of person (18 years and older) with schizophrenia diagnosed for at least six months by any criteria based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Third Edition Revised (DSM-III-R), the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition Text Revision (DSM-IV TR), the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), or confirmed by their attending psychiatrists. Non-schizophrenic patients such as patients with psychosis, depression, bipolar, dementia, alcoholism, and substance-related disorders will be excluded. The family is defined as key persons who live or who are in close contact with the patient or who provide care or have taken on role as the main caregivers for a family member with schizophrenia. The caregivers should be at least 18 years old who can be parents, siblings, spouses, children, or other relatives. This review will consider studies in any culture. Studies that explore experiences of patients with schizophrenia will be excluded. Caregiving experiences are defined as any subjective data that families expressed or shared about their feelings and perceptions related to their caring or living with their schizophrenia member including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes or beliefs, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest The review will consider qualitative studies that explore caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia that related to their caring or living with their schizophrenia member including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes or beliefs, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. This review will include studies conducted in either hospital or community settings. Types of outcomes The outcomes of interest include but are not restricted to the following 1. Subjective accounts of families of patients with schizophrenia related to caregiving. 2. Attitudes, beliefs, or feelings of families toward living or caring a patient with schizophrenia. 3. Families' perceived caring tasks, responses, or actions to patients with schizophrenia. 4. Perceived needs of families of patients with schizophrenia. 5. Coping, help seeking behaviors, ways to solve problems of families of patients with schizophrenia. Types of studies The review will consider any qualitative studies that draw on caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia, using research methodologies including, but not limited to phenomenology, grounded theory and ethnography. Search strategy Prior to commencing the review, a search of databases, Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute library of systematic reviews will be conducted to ensure that there is no systematic review conducted on lived experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia. A comprehensive search strategy will be developed to find both published and unpublished studies in English and Thai languages from 1990-2010. A three step search strategy will be used in this review as follow: 1. An initial limited search of journals indexed in MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title, abstracts, and subject descriptors / MeSH terms of relevant articles used to identify additional key words. In this review, initial English keywords to be used will be: lived experiences or experiences, meanings, attitudes, beliefs, feelings, views, tasks, caring tasks, caring activities, roles, responses, actions, family or families, relatives, caregivers, careers, parents or father or mother, spouse or wife or husband, siblings, son, daughter, child or children, schizophrenia, qualitative. In addition, initial Thai keywords to be used will be: krobkrua = family, phudola = caregiver, yat = relatives, prasobkan = experience, tatsanakati or jettakati = attitudes, kwamchua = belief, botbat = role or task, jittaphet = schizophrenia, wijuy cheang kunnaphab = qualitative research 2. All identified key words and the synonyms will be used for the extensive search by respective electronic databases. Individual search strategies will be developed for each database, adopting the different terminology of index thesauri if available. The databases to be searched include: -CINAHL -EMBASE -Cochrane Library -PubMed - Science Direct -Scopus -PsycINFO -ProQuest -www.thairesearch.in.th and tdc.thailis.or.th/tdc (database for Thai study languages) 3. Reference lists and bibliographies of retrieved articles will also be searched for additional relevant articles. In order to avoid publication bias, hand searching will also be undertaken in journals which are not listed on databases but are known to contain literature in this topic of investigation to ensure all relevant materials are captured. The relevant unpublished studies such as conference papers, research reports, and dissertations will be searched by the following sources: -MEDNAR -Dissertation International -Conference Proceedings In addition, content experts will also be contacted in order to provide other alternatives for securing relevant literature. All studies identified during the database search will be assessed for relevance to the review objectives and full reports will be retrieved for all studies that meet the inclusion criteria as assessed independently by two reviewers. Discrepancies in reviewer selections will be resolved by discussion prior to selected articles being retrieved. Those studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be subjected to critical appraisal using a standardised Joanna Briggs Critical appraisal instrument. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised a critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Data will be extracted from papers included in the review using the standardised data extraction tool from the JBI-QARI (Appendix II). The data extracted will include specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Research findings will, where possible be pooled using the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). This will involve the aggregation or synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation, through assembling the findings (Level 1 findings) rates according to their quality, and categorising these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning (Level 2 findings). These categories are then subjected to a metasynthesis in order to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesised findings (Level 3 findings) that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Where textual pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. Conflicts of interest There is no conflict of interest regarding this systematic review.

      "abstract": "The psychological manifestation of ED often includes performance anxiety and may lead to high levels of distress and damage to self-esteem and manhood. If unchecked, this may have significant implications for patients' sexual and intimate relationships and broader psychosocial functioning. The assessment of ED should therefore identify any psychological (patients' and their partners') and interpersonal factors that may be contributing to ED etiology as well as potential sources of resistance, non-adherence, or treatment dropout. Gathering this information will help the clinician identify potential barriers to treatment, which can then be addressed early to optimize pharmaceutical treatment and restoration of sexual function. Rather than focusing solely on ED symptoms, clinicians should address the impact of ED and treatment on the broader sexual experience for men and their partners using direct, non-threatening questions Alternatively, the clinician may use brief self-report questionnaires to introduce the topic of ED or screen for depressive and anxiety symptoms. The clinician may want to include partners in the assessment or treatment stages. It is beyond the scope of clinicians treating ED to address long-standing psychopathology or disordered personality traits, though assessment of these factors will give insight into potential psychological and interpersonal causes of ED. Referrals may be used to address broader psychological or relationship problems.",

      "title": "Volitional Monocular Lilliputian Visual Hallucinations and Synesthesia",
      "abstract": "Depression, mania, bipolar affective illness with rapid cycling, and paranoid schizophreniform psychoses are common sources of distress in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibiting demyelinating plaques over the temporal lobes [1]. Dementia may occur in MS subjects. A previously reported patient with complex visual hallucinations of religious content and dementia had a large, left frontal plaque and multiple temporal and occipital lobe plaques located over the periventricular white matter [2]. The authors suggested the existence of a disconnection syndrome caused by demyelination of the long subcortical white matter association bundles of the cerebral hemispheres [2]. A patient with MS and complex behavioral manifestations, initially confused with psychiatric illness, is reported. She had no previous history of psychiatric disorders. Despite her isolated complex hallucinations and unusual experiential phenomena, she had no clinical evidence of dementia or intercurrent psychosis.A 54-year old female with no personal or family history of neurologic or psychiatric illnesses suffered a grand mal seizure without aura 7 years prior to her neurologic consultation. She was healthy until her first seizure, and no concurrent illness was identified on initial evaluation. She had no family history of epilepsy and was taking no prescription or illicit drugs. After her first seizure, she had ataxia and retrograde amnesia for a few weeks. Her initial MRI of the brain showed white matter lesions of the cerebral hemispheres. Oligoclonal bands were recovered from her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF cell count and protein content were normal, and cultures for bacteria and viruses were negative. Her EEG showed bilateral temporal theta but no specific epileptic discharges. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy. A second grand mal seizure took place 6 months later, and treatment was initiated with carbamazepine. Her second seizure was followed in 2 days by visual hallucinations of small objects while remaining fully conscious. She also noticed that the last words of a sentence, or a full sentence said to her, would repeat within her head over and over again, sometimes for as long as 30 min (echoacousia and palinacusis). Spontaneous auditory hallucinations of music, bells ringing, clocks ticking, dogs barking, cats meowing or birds chirping followed. Within months, she noticed that objects or the faces of people she stared at persisted in her sight for minutes at a time (palinopsia). If she shifted her eyes to the wall, the faces or objects appeared on the wall (visual allesthesia). At one time her face appeared '25 years younger' when she looked at herself in the mirror (facial rejuvenation). Over time, auditory hallucinations became very vivid and continuous ('racing'), to the extent that she had a very hard time falling asleep and required hypnotics. She woke up every morning to loud music within her head. She was referred to psychiatry for treatment, despite that with her hallucinations she did not experience any other alterations of consciousness, or exhibit any bizarre behavior. She was empirically treated with various tranquilizers, including haloperidol, for several years. Grand mal seizures never recurred, even after carbamazepine was discontinued, but her hallucinations did not mitigate with any treatment. Three years after the onset of her illness, she developed the unusual ability of voluntarily bringing on audiovisual TV-like hallucinations of small objects, animals, or people that either made sounds, spoke, or sang to her. For instance, if she thought of a specific famous country singer, the singer immediately appeared over her left eye singing (synesthesia). Her visual hallucinations were always stationary and confined to the upper temporal quadrant of her left eye. If she thought of an old classmate, she would see him or her clearly, the way the person was during their school years, talking to her. What the person said was appropriate and was not threatening or anxiety provoking. In other words, the content of what was said 'made sense' within the context of her retrieved memory. She was unable to hold conversations with her hallucinatory persons and had clear recollection of her hallucinations. Her general physical examination was normal. On mental status examination she was alert and oriented to time, space and person. She was appropriate, pleasant, cooperative and well-groomed. Mood and affect were normal. She exhibited no flight of ideas, hesitant, slow or bizarre thinking. Her answers were relevant and her statements logical; she had no delusions, ideas of reference, or ideas of influence. Speech was fluent, repetition was intact, and comprehension of spoken language was preserved. She was able to read aloud and silently, write spontaneously and to dictation, and draw figures normally. Mathematical calculations, including serial subtractions and ability to abstract, were normal. Short- and long-term memory were normal, as well as her attention span. There was no confabulation. Fund of knowledge, judgment, and insight of illness were good. She could recognize objects placed in her hands and had no difficulties with fine finger motor control. She could imitate gestures, and exhibited no neglect, apraxia, aprosody or prosopagnosia. She could initiate her visual hallucinations as described above on many occasions during her repeated neurologic examinations while otherwise acting appropriately. She exhibited no mood changes, alteration of consciousness, facial transfiguration, or anxiety during her visual phenomena. No stereotyped or involuntary movements were noted at those times. On neurologic examination, corrected visual acuity, visual fields, and pupillary responses were normal. Ocular movements were full and symmetric in all directions of gaze. No nystagmus was observed. Hearing was normal. Testing of the additional cranial nerves, equilibrium, muscle tone, muscle strength and sensory examination for all modalities was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and she had no grasp, rooting, or palmomental reflexes. She had bilateral Babinski signs. There was no gait disturbance and no tremors or dystonia. A repeat MRI of the brain revealed occipital periventricular areas of demyelination, subcortical white matter hyperintensities, and one small area of demyelination over the right temporal lobe (fig. 1, 2). There was no hydrocephalus and no brain stem lesions. Short and middle latency auditory evoked potentials were normal. Her blink reflexes showed a delay of the R1 component. Facial electromyogram showed polyphasic motor units of long duration over the frontalis, mentalis and orbicularis oris muscles, indicative of chronic denervation with reinnervation. Baseline EEG was normal. Her video-EEG monitoring (no sphenoidal electrodes were employed) and brain SPECT during her typical voluntarily induced visual hallucinations failed to demonstrate epileptic discharges or blood perfusion abnormalities from the normal resting awake state. Treatment with clonazepam helped her to sleep, but did not change her hallucinations. She reported no changes in her symptoms on follow-up visits.Complex partial seizures of purely cognitive content in MS patients can be confused with intermittent behavioral manifestations of the disease due to a relapse. Therefore, it is important that epileptic events are ruled out in patients with MS who exhibit unusual recurrent symptoms, especially in the absence of motor manifestations. Although this patient had two grand mal seizures at the onset of her illness, her EEG was normal with no paroxysmal activity recorded at rest or during her spontaneous or volitional visual hallucinations. Furthermore, a brain SPECT that was completed during her volitional and spontaneous experiential phenomena was unchanged from the normal resting state while awake. Her visual symptoms must be distinguished from complex visual hallucinations and palinopsia secondary to disorders of the visual pathways. The case herein discussed had bilateral white matter hyperintensities on MRI, but no detectable abnormalities on her visual field testings.Dysmetropsia is the disorder of visual perception characterized by an apparent modification of the size of perceived objects. Objects appear either enlarged (macropsia) or shrunk (micropsia). Monocular micropsia is a symptom of retinal edema, while hemimicropsia refers to a selective disturbance in the perception of the size of an object, contralateral to a hemispheric lesion, in the absence of visual field deficits [3]. On the other hand, lilliputian or smaller than life-size colorful visual hallucinations in a clear sensorium are typical of peduncular hallucinosis in patients with lesions of the mesencephalon [4]. This patient's complex symptoms are unique because her lilliputian imagery was confined to the temporal superior quadrant of her left visual field, was faithfully reproduced voluntarily, and she had no detectable abnormalities on her visual field testing and no brain stem, thalamic, or optic nerve lesions. Although the temporal lobe demyelinating lesion may have interrupted conduction through callosal fibers (fig. 1) or through the uncinate fasciculus (fig. 2, she had none of the clinical signs of callosal disconnection and there was no evidence of transcortical aphasia. Finally, synesthesia (experiential phenomena perceived in two or more senses simultaneously) of temporal lobe epileptic origin was ruled out in this patient by her normal ictal EEG [5]. It is a common observation in clinical practice that patients with episodic painful or epileptic disorders have an inherent permissive ability to 'prime' or 'cue' their episodes, either consciously or unconsciously. In multiple sclerosis, amplification of abnormal signals arising from the areas of demyelination perhaps may be 'gated ad lib' in some exceptional cases, as the one detailed here [6]. The discovery of Bumgartner and Epstein [7]that normal individuals can voluntarily alter their visual evoked potentials without shifting their eyes supports this inherent quality of the human brain to freely modify ongoing electrophysiologic activities. The ultimate basic pathophysiology of this patient's experiential phenomena is uncertain; it may be speculated that 'cross talking' of demyelinated subcortical white matter fibers caused her symptoms, since her ictal EEG and SPECT studies were normal, revealing no epilepsy or abnormalities of brain perfusion. It is unclear what role was played by the commisural occipital fibers of the tapetum lining the walls of the posterior ventricular horns in the expression or modulation of this patient's visual hallucinations.Very recently, a patient was described with TV-like 'picture within a picture' lilliputian visual hallucinations that were embedded in her left inferior visual field, and emerged from an otherwise normal visual background. She was aware of the hallucinatory nature of her experience but had no synesthesia and no volitional control over her hallucinations. A left inferior quadrantonopsia was present and her brain MRI revealed a parieto-occipital stroke [8].",

      "abstract": "At the onset, differentiation between abnormal non-epileptic movements, and epileptic seizures presenting in early life is difficult as is clinical diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of the various seizure disorders presenting at this age. Seizures starting in the first year of life including the neonatal period might have a favorable course, such as in infants presenting with benign familial neonatal epilepsy, febrile seizures simplex or acute symptomatic seizures. However, in some cases, the onset of seizures at birth or in the first months of life have a dramatic evolution with severe cerebral impairment. Seizure disorders starting in early life include the \"epileptic encephalopathies\", a group of conditions characterized by drug resistant seizures, delayed developmental skills, and intellective disability. This group of disorders includes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy also known as Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, infantile spasms syndrome (also known as West syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (also known as Dravet syndrome) and, myoclonic encephalopathies in non-progressive disorder. Here we report on seizures manifesting in the first year of life including the neonatal period. Conditions with a benign course, and those with severe evolution are presented. At this early age, clinical identification of seizures, distinction of each of these disorders, type of treatment and prognosis is particularly challenging. The aim of this report is to present the clinical manifestations of each of these disorders and provide an updated review of the conditions associated with seizures in the first year of life.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own.

      "title": "[Current concept of schizophrenia: state of the art].",
      "abstract": "Approaches to diagnosing schizophrenia are different. There is a distinct tendency either to narrow the limits of the disease or to expand it, which in some cases leads to a disagreement and even a tendency to disputes. The comprehensive studies conducted in the Mental Health Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, have provided an overall notion of the disease in terms of its progression and outcome. The clinical picture of schizophrenia is characterized by obligatory specific disorders, such as autism, reduced energy potential, emotional thinking, and behavioral disorders. Personality changes may be seen as the smoothening of specific personality traits and the appearance of the features that are not inherent to the patients in the past. Schizophernia is also characterized by positive psychopathological syndromes: pseudoneurotic, affective, psychopathy-like, hallucinatory-paranoid and catatonic. A study of 7500 patients with schizophrenia demonstrated that there were clear-cut regularities in the development of the disease, which suggest that there are forms and types in its progression. The study identified 3 forms of development: continuous, recurrent, and attack-like progressive with varying degrees and rates of the process (severe, moderate, and mild). Genealogical and clinicogenetic studies demonstrated accumulation of psychoses and abnormal personalities in the families of probands, manifest and slowly progressive forms of schizophrenia and cases of schizoid psychopathy. Among the wide spectrum of pathogenetic concepts, priority should be given to the dopamine hypothesis, whose main point is accumulation of an excessive amount of dopamine in the brain tissue, especially in the nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic systems. This may lead to activation of dopaminergic brain structures with an increase of dopamine receptors. This hypothesis is confirmed by the neuropathological studies demonstrating a significant increase in the numerical density of the dendritic spines and dendritic trunks in the with layer of the prefrontal cortex. The highest index of the numerical density was observed in young patients with prevalent negative disorders. Inasmuch as there is no correlation of this index with the duration of the disease, it can be concluded that the abundance of synaptical connections is a result of disturbed brain development and a factor predisposing to severe progression of schizophrenia. Treatment modalities are determined by the form and rate of progression of and the pattern of the psychopathological syndrome. Of particular importance is the role of age, somatic state, and individual sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs. Another important factor in the treatment of schizophrenia is a simultaneous or consecutive impact on the psychopathological syndrome and the disease as a whole.",

      "title": "SELF-ESTEEM, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY, AND SUICIDAL IDEATION IN ADOLESCENTS: RESULTS OF THREE STUDIES",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Suicidal behavior has different levels: ideation, contemplation, planning and preparation, attempt, and consummation. Likewise, suicidal behavior comprises all the actions aimed at achieving suicide. During adolescence there is a tendency to a reduction of emotional well-being. Thus, adolescents may engage in dangerous behavior, extreme narcissism and individualization, exclusion and social isolation. Another element playing an important role during adolescence is self-esteem. Low self-esteem could lead to apathy, isolation, and passivity. Conversely, high self-esteem is associated with more active lives, a greater control over circumstances, less anxiety and greater capacity to cope with internal and external stress. Although there are other factors that could predispose adolescents towards suicidal behavior, certain studies have identified depressive symptomatology as the most powerful and independent risk factor in suicidal ideation and it has been argued that it should be regarded as an expression of severe depression. The purpose of this study is to explore the existence of a relationship between low self-esteem and depressive symptomatology with suicidal ideation and to explore if gender has an effect in this interaction. Data were obtained from three different samples of Mexican adolescent students. The instruments used were the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the CESD, and the Roberts Suicidal Ideation Scale. Women showed a higher frequency of low self-esteem than men in two studies. In another, men had a significantly higher frequency of low self-esteem. Regarding depressive symptomatology, women obtained higher scores than men. No significant differences were found in one study. The percentages of high suicidal ideation displayed greater variability by gender and by study. Among the subjects who reported high suicide ideation, a greater proportion of women tended to have low selfesteem, though these differences were not significant in any study. Over half of the women in each study reported higher suicidal ideation and depressive symptomatology than men, with significant differences only among junior high students in two studies. The exploration of the link between depressive symptomatology and high suicidal ideation showed significant differences by gender, a finding which might be linked to the fact that women are more allowed to express their depressive or fatalistic feelings and thoughts or death wishes, whereas among men this type of ideas are perceived as a sign of weakness. Gender-related differences in low self-esteem were only found in one study; men had a higher percentage than women. The comparison of low self-esteem in subjects with high suicidal ideation did not reveal any statistical difference by gender, despite it has been identified as a risk factor for suicidal behavior. In the other hand, results of depressive symptomatology concurred with international literature about this being a determinant factor in the presence of suicidal ideation in women. Considering the objective of this study, three main conclusions can be suggested. First, low self-esteem is not significantly linked to suicidal ideation, perhaps because it is a risk factor more associated with suicidal behavior. Second, depressive symptomatology was related to suicidal ideation, and although this relationship and the one between depressive symptomatology and self-esteem have been reported before, it is important to note that there seems to be a domino effect among these problems. This effect could begin with depressive symptoms linked to suicidal ideation, which in turn could affect self-esteem, and subsequently trigger suicidal behavior. And third, differences between men and women raise the question of whether these are caused by intrinsic characteristics in a biological-genetic substrate inherent to each gender or whether they are determined by the cultural context and the formative patterns existing in the groups to which the subjects belong.",

      "abstract": "Starting with Ciompis model of \"affect logic\" I want to show that affective, cognitive and behavioral patterns, once emerged in psychosis, subsequently tend to repetition and chronification on account of psychological, social but also neuronal plasticity. In the discussion about reasons of the chronification process, negative symptoms become more and more relevant. Beside the primary negative symptoms, patients develop coping strategies to avoid a new relapse. These secondary negative symptoms, however, should not only be understood as an adaptation effort of internal \"disturbing factors\", but also of external ones, caused by the surroundings. Therefore, the patient's behavior should not be seen detached from his context. To see negative symptoms also as coping strategy has major therapeutical implications for community psychiatry, because of the involved option that negative symptoms can be replaced by more curative and less disabling behaviour, i.e. they are accessible to therapeutical efforts. That means for community psychiatry, however, to develop itself out of its deficit oriented treatment paradigm and to increase its therapeutical ambitions.",

A case is presented of a young male suicide victim whose antemortem course did not demonstrate apparent psychopathology to either his family or fellow students. A journal written by the decedent was found, however, which revealed extensive ruminations on death, depressive symptomatology, and evidence of possible delusions, and hallucinations. We opine that this represents the prodrome of a psychotic process, possibly schizophrenia, and the decedent’s suicide was a response to his awareness of his deteriorating mental status. The prodrome of schizophrenia is a well-described entity that manifests as a decline in social and occupational functioning, along with increasingly bizarre behavior. Prodromal psychosis could represent an explanation for some cases of suicide seemingly without causation.",

It is in this clinical area that we encounter particularly difficult patients who, subject to emotional dysregulation and tendency to impulsive action, cause much trouble to clinicians and health workers committed to their treatment. The contribution of psychopathology becomes essential whenever it allows the clinician to move from the level of symptoms to that of lived experience. When this shift is not attempted, the clinician’s gaze remains dominated by the triad of stigmatisation, intractability and chronicity. To ask “what is it like to be a person with BPD” means, for example, to identify the characteristics of a perpetually dysphoric mood condition that forces the subject to look for ways to quickly reduce such uncomfortable state. Psychopathology allows us to shed light on the dynamics of dysphoric mood and the transformation of dysphoria into anger: this knowledge can also help reduce the risk of emotional mirror-involvement in the clinician.",

      "abstract": "Making a differential diagnosis between schizoaffective disorder with major depressive episode and paranoid schizophrenia is difficult. The patient is at the threshold of neurotic versus psychotic, the intensity of ideation phenomenon being very high and specific to both disorders, it is required an assessment based on life and disorder history information, but also the emotional presence of the patient in the clinical interview. In this case study we suggest a literature comparison but also an evaluation profile of the disorder, marked by a psychiatric illness in which the person shows both affective symptoms (depressive or maniac) and symptoms of schizophrenia (such as delusions, hallucinations). Hypothesis: symptoms of the patient are oscillating between paranoid elements (paranoid schizophrenia) and affective elements (schizoaffective disorder). These oscillations are based on a fragile Ego structure with cognitive rigidity. The study outlines an immature-dependent personality profile, based on interpretativity, with passive-aggressive elements, hypersensitivity, psychotic operation and through psychotic elements manifested in the past (auditory hallucinations, as voices). Also, the basis of the transfer and counter-transference elements identified, the emotional resonance is low, with a risk of psychotic decompensation. Conclusions: Depressive schizoaffective disorder is characterized by presence of both depressive and schizophrenia symptoms in the same time period. Depressive symptoms includes: depressed mood, reduced interest, sluggishness, low energy, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, feelings of despair. During the same episode are present symptoms of schizophrenia: hallucinations, delusions of control, state of hyper-vigilance, delusions injury. Clinical examination cannot be a chance encounter because the history of mental suffering tight interfere with subject's essential history in that it creates a gap and that subjectivity psychiatric symptoms inferred immense emotional and personal participation of the subject.",

This results in severe problems with social relationships, communication, and behavior. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) defines autism as a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by: • Impairments in communication • Impairments in social interaction, and • Restricted, repetitive, and stereotypic patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASDs) handle information in their brain differently than other people. ASDs are “spectrum disorders.” That means ASDs affect each person in different ways, and can range from very mild to severe. Children with ASDs share some similar symptoms, such as problems with social interaction. But there are differences in when the symptoms start, how severe they are, and the exact nature of the symptoms. It is a spectrum condition, which means that, while all children with autism share certain difficulties, their condition will affect them in different ways. Some people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need a lifetime of specialist support. Children with autism may also experience over- or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light or colors.",

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "title": "The Adjustment Disorder Diagnosis, Its Importance to Liaison Psychiatry, and its Psychobiology",
      "abstract": "Adjustment Disorder (AD) is one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses employed. In fact, it is the most frequent diagnosis utilized for psychiatric disorders in the military and in children, and is often utilized in the consultation-liaison medical setting. However, it is acknowledged that the diagnosis is not reliable, it cannot be validated, and it has an important degree of subjective consideration in its use. Commonly used screening tools like the Hamilton and Beck Depression Scales do not give an assessment of AD. Furthermore, its use is accompanied with descriptors of depression, anxiety, mixed affects, etc., so that it crosses over several areas of psychiatric dysfunction. It does allow the placement of a patient within a psychiatric diagnosis when they do not reach criteria for a major psychiatric nomenclature. To date, biological studies have not been reported. It is not known if AD with depression is closer to the biological characteristics of depression, or AD with anxiety would have similar characteristics to that seen with major anxiety. It is also not known if AD has a biological signature that would make them an entity with common features, or if they may be more closely allied biologically with the descriptor that accompanies them. Nevertheless, AD is an important category in any psychiatric lexicon and warrants further study and biological understanding.",

      "abstract": "Background:&nbsp;The principle features of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. There is little evidence that confirms that Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is arising purely from child rearing methods or social factors.76 % of children with ADHD has a family history, and the similar cases can be seen in the family. The symptoms of more than 50 % of ADHD children will continue in adulthood which requires treatment. Most of the causes appear for ADHD are categorizing the condition in a group of neurobiological and genetic disorders. This does not mean to say that the influence of environmental factors on the severity of disorder, impairment and suffering the child may experience is nil, but those factors do not give rise to the condition by themselves. The chances of getting associated problems like Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) in children with ADHD is one-third to one-half and ODD is more common in boys with ADHD. These children are often non compliant, stubborn, defiant, have outbursts of temper, or become belligerent.Case description:&nbsp;This is a case report of a child who diagnosed as attention deficit hyper active disordered and Oppositional Defiant Disordered (ODD) child, with finger contractures of right hand, which treated with medications, behavioral therapy, physiotherapy, relaxation techniques and music therapy as the means of rehabilitation.Outcome measures: The evaluation measures used are Nine-hole peg test, behavioral rating scale and a seven items temperament evaluation scale.Discussion:&nbsp;A holistic rehabilitation therapy increased attention, listening to suggestions, short stories and sleeping in time. Oppositional behaviors were also reduced both at home and school. Her relationships with parent, teachers and school mates were improved. Listening skills, attention, daily activities such as wake up, brushing, bathing, going to school in time were also improved. The single case study design limits generalization but this work supports THE role of multi disciplinary approach in testing ADHD children.",

A diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, or recurrent severe depressive illness, is, at best, a lifelong vulnerability and, at worst, a continuous chronic condition with serious associated disabilities. Like many physical chronic diseases, such an illness demands of the individual and those closest to them acceptance of a highly unpalatable diagnosis, adjustments in lifestyle and life expectations, and the often unwelcome realities of long-term treatment and service involvement— if relapse and long-term disability are to be minimized. As with other chronic diseases, the organization of care needs to include a greater emphasis on certain key elements.",

      "abstract": "Among the severe personality disordered offenders, those with an antisocial personality stand out because, especially when psychopathic, they often are involved in serious crimes. Severe antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and psychopathy are ubiquitous. They are frequently present among unruly and delinquent adolescents, regardless of social, family, and economic status. Their dyssocial behaviors are easily noted. Their personalities often predict career delinquency. As adults, they are found in the community at large. Psychopaths may be successful or unsuccessful in their social behavior. Successful psychopaths are frequently found among professional people who often easily climb the social and professional ladder. They may be found among business people, who frequently manifest their ruthless desire for achievement. They are narcissistic, unemotional, impulsive, and compulsive in their behaviors. When incarcerated, psychopaths often successfully violate institutional rules, because their charming personality helps them to navigate to their benefit the carceral system. Most frequently, as with ASPD offenders, psychopaths are egocentric and tend to project blame for their criminal acts unto others. Their offenses are positively related to the degree of their psychopathy: The higher the degree of psychopathy, the more serious the offense. Their behaviors tend to be compulsive and they claim that they are unable to refrain from amoral and illegal acts. Psychological screening may find them not legally responsible for their actions. In this issue of the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology (IJOTCC), DeLisi and colleagues, discussing psychopathy and using the Psychopathic Personality Inventory–Short Form (PPIS), report that its eight subscales point out behaviors typical of psychopaths. Among their findings, blame externalization seems to be the strongest predictor of psychopathic antisocial behaviors and career delinquency. The readers will certainly appreciate the knowledge that the authors are passing on. Recent progress in neuroimaging of the brain supports the idea that ASPD, and especially psychopathy, are affected by dysfunctions of brain physiology and anatomy,",

      "title": "P2‐432: Who refuses diagnostic assessment for dementia?",
      "abstract": "Dementia is a chronic, progressive and eventually fatal disorder characterized by cognitive decline in memory and at least one other cognitive domain such as language, visuo-spatial, or executive function. Presently, dementia is under recognized in the primary care of older adults. Screening for dementia in primary care increases recognition and treatment of reversible causes of memory loss and may delay of disease progression. In addition, earlier identification of dementia through screening may improve the diagnostic process and provide opportunities for physicians to discuss prognosis, learn about patient's goals, and tailor prevention and disease management targets and may improve patient and family outcomes such as knowledge about dementia, preparedness for future medical decisions, and confidence in medical decision-making. Once patients screen positive, they may delay or decline a diagnostic assessment for dementia due to concerns about having others know about their cognitive status, the belief that dementia cannot be treated or a general negative attitude toward medical assessment. In addition, previous studies have found that despite a caregiver recognizing more benefits from diagnostic assessment, 70.3% had a hard time accepting their family member's cognitive decline and 67.7% were concerned with how the diagnosis would impact their own life. In an effort to design patient-centered interventions to increase screening and diagnostic assessments, it is important to understand and enumerate the behaviors regarding diagnostic assessment. The purpose of this cross-sectional survey study is to determine the characteristics and perceptions of patients who completed the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM-PC) Questionnaire and screened positive for dementia but subsequently refused further diagnostic assessment for dementia compared to those who screened positive and agreed to a diagnostic assessment. Cross- sectional survey of 554 primary care patients 65 years old and older without a diagnosis of dementia attending urban primary care clinics in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 2008-2009. Perceptions of dementia screening were measured with the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM-PC) instrument. The PRISM-PC includes scales for benefits, stigma, independence, and suffering which are scored from 0 (strongly disagree on all items) to 100 (strongly agree on all items) with 50 as a neutral score. Refusing diagnostic assessment for dementia was determined by the percentage of patients who screened positive on at least one of two written screening instruments MMSE or CSI-D) but subsequently refused a diagnostic assessment at a specialty clinic. Associations were assessed between scores on the PRISM-PC questionnaire, screening performance, and behavior regarding diagnostic assessment for those with a positive screen. 497 individuals completed the PRISM-PC and agreed to dementia screening. Of those who agreed to screening, 63 (12.6%) screened positive. Among the 63 participants who screened positive, 21 (33.3%) accepted diagnostic assessment and 42 (66.6%) refused diagnostic assessment. Those who accepted diagnostic assessment did not differ in age, race, sex, education or income compared to those who refused diagnostic assessment. Individuals who refused diagnostic assessment following a positive screening test were more likely to live alone (p = 0.008). A bivariate comparison of the mean PRISM-PC scores of participants who accepted a diagnostic assessment and participants who refused it (Table 1) showed that there was a significant difference in the domain score for stigma of dementia screening (35.2 vs. 42.0; P = .045) but not in the domain scores for the benefits of dementia screening, the negative impact of dementia screening on independence, and the suffering related to dementia screening. There were also significant differences regarding the individual item that asked about agreement to be tested for Alzheimer's disease with a short questionnaire (3.9 vs. 3.5; P=023). In order to improve acceptance of diagnostic assessments for dementia, development of a decision aid that describes the components of what a diagnostic assessment entails as well as emphasizing potential benefits of early identification and acknowledgment of the perceived stigmata of having a dementia diagnosis may reduce patient reluctance to undergo a diagnostics assessment for dementia.",

      "title": "Biomarcadores de estrés e inflamación en la psicosis temprana",
      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, de consecuencias devastadoras, que afecta como una persona piensa, siente y actua. Tiene un gran impacto en la salud de la poblacion, afectando entre 7 a 8 personas por cada 1.000. Mas alarmante es el hecho de que en Espana, los anos de vida potencialmente perdidos por muerte prematura o discapacidad atribuible, la situan en el primer lugar junto con otras enfermedades neurologicas. En la esquizofrenia se debe intervenir cuanto antes, ya que el tiempo de psicosis que transcurra sin tratar, conduce a la persona hacia una evolucion poco satisfactoria. Para cuando un joven reciba tratamiento por un trastorno psicotico incipiente, el dano neurologico y psicosocial ya habra ocurrido, afectando dominios fundamentales para su desarrollo como persona, que le aseguraran un futuro con peores logros educativos, mayor desempleo y una menor autonomia e independencia. No se conoce con exactitud como se origina la esquizofrenia, pero diversas variantes del genoma, al igual que los factores ambientales, el estres y la inflamacion, juegan un papel relevante. La evidencia acumulada demuestra tambien que en estos pacientes se encuentran niveles aumentados de marcadores inflamatorios (interleucina 6 [IL-6], proteina C reactiva [CRP] y fibrinogeno) y de prolactina (no asociado al tratamiento antipsicotico), ademas de un deterioro en la regulacion del eje hipotalamo-hipofisis-suprarrenal (HHS). El diagnostico de sujetos con alto riesgo de psicosis es eminentemente clinico, siendo perentoria la identificacion de posibles biomarcadores que contribuyan a aumentar el valor predictivo de los criterios de riesgo ultra elevado (UHR). Este trabajo de tesis doctoral se centra en el estudio de dichos biomarcadores, integrando el trabajo experimental al estudio de sujetos con estado mental de alto riesgo (EMAR) de psicosis y pacientes con un trastorno psicotico incipiente (TPI) que asisten a un centro de intervencion precoz, por lo que nos planteamos como supuesto fundamental, que el estres ambiental y los biomarcadores relacionados con el estres (cortisol y prolactina) y la inflamacion (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogeno y albumina), se asocian con el riesgo de desarrollar un TPI en las etapas iniciales de la psicosis. Para ello se determinaron los niveles de los distintos biomarcadores en suero (IL-6, CRP, albumina, cortisol y prolactina), plasma (fibrinogeno) y saliva (cortisol basal y respuesta del cortisol al despertar). Tambien se genotipo a partir del DNA genomico el SNP funcional del IL6 rs1800795. Se valoro clinicamente a los participantes mediante la adaptacion espanola del SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) a fin de obtener diagnosticos segun el DSM-IV. Se valoro el nivel de UHR en sujetos EMAR mediante la aplicacion de la CAARMS (Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States). Por ultimo, se midio la severidad de los sintomas positivos y negativos mediante la escala PANSS, el estres percibido mediante la Escala de Reajuste Social de Holmes-Rahe, la percepcion psicologica del estres aplicando la Escala de Estres Percibido, se valoro los habitos dieteticos mediante la entrevista clinica nutricional, y los sintomas depresivos aplicando las escalas de depresion de Hamilton (HDRS) y de Calgary para esquizofrenia (CDSS). Un primer estudio transversal demostro niveles aumentados de IL-6 en sujetos EMAR frente a controles sanos, y la asociacion positiva de la IL-6 con los sintomas negativos tanto en EMAR como en TPI, y la asociacion positiva (EMAR) y negativa (TPI) con los sintomas positivos. 35% de los sujetos EMAR hicieron la transicion a psicosis (EMAR-P) presentando un aumento no significativas del nivel de la IL-6 frente a quienes no la hicieron (EMAR-NP). Un segundo estudio, de caracter longitudinal, demostro niveles elevados de estres psicologico, prolactina y mas bajos de albumina en sujetos EMAR-P frente a los EMAR-NP y el grupo control. Tambien encontramos diferencias significativas en la secrecion de cortisol al despertar. En el tercer estudio de esta tesis doctoral, de caracter transversal, confirmamos la hipotesis que niveles bajos de los marcadores de inflamacion periferica (CRP y fibrinogeno) estan asociados con el tratamiento antidepresivo en sujetos con un TPI.",

      "title": "Irritability: A concept analysis",
      "abstract": "Irritability is a term used to describe feelings of anger, annoyance and impatience, and is commonly experienced by individuals in daily life. However, there are diverse conceptualizations of irritability in public and clinical research, which often result in confusing irritability with anger and other overlapping concepts. This, in turn, leads to a lack of conceptual clarity. Accordingly, the purpose of this concept analysis was to explore the irritability concept, including its definitions, defining characteristics, antecedents, consequences and empirical referents. The findings showed that irritability is predominantly conceptualized as a psychophysiological concept in the literature. We demonstrated that irritability can be differentiated from overlapping concepts like anger by qualities, such as 'unpredictability and lowered emotion control', 'lowered threshold for negative emotional stimuli', 'being manifested in response to frustrative situations or physiological needs' and 'experience of disproportionate and unjustified emotional irritation'. Importantly, severe irritability prospectively predicts psychiatric disorders and greater impairments in health, financial, educational and social functioning in individuals. Taken together, our analysis showed that one should take into account the context, duration, intensity and importantly outcomes, when assessing irritability in an individual. Considering these findings and the presence of irritability in nursing practice, it is crucial for nurses to recognize and successfully identify this concept in the nursing care they provide within the diverse settings and patient populations.",

Hyperparathyroidism- and hypercalcemia-related acute psychotic symptoms can be challenging to diagnose in patients with mental health-related disorders, and it should be considered a possible differential in these patients besides medications. It can sometimes be the first manifestation of the disease, and diagnosis can be challenging, especially in patients with a previous psychiatric history without checking their biochemistry profile. The hypercalcemia severity can vary from mild to severe, and signs and symptoms may also vary depending on the calcium levels. Hypercalcemia can cause neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and patients may present with confusion, agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. We present a case of a 54-year-old patient with a previous history of bipolar disorder and a recent diagnosis of depression and schizophreniform disorder, who presented to the emergency department with acute agitation, violent behavior, and disorientation. She was being managed by the community mental health team at a local behavioral health hospital for new onset psychosis over the past few months. She was refusing blood tests prior to hospital admission. Calcium level on laboratory tests was 3.54 mmol/l, and parathyroid hormone level was 45 pg/ml. She was managed with intravenous fluids initially, followed by zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously over 15 minutes). She was then commenced on cinacalcet 30 mg twice daily initially, which was later increased to 60 mg twice daily. Ultrasound of the neck demonstrated a large left parathyroid mass, and she underwent left parathyroidectomy as an urgent outpatient. She has remained asymptomatic, and her psychiatry symptoms resolved following parathyroidectomy.",

      "abstract": "Familial aggregation of major depression might indicate a genetic liability for the disorder. The complete disorder or, alternatively, only some individual symptoms might be inherited. Under the latter condition, an increased frequency of inherited symptoms might consecutively increase the likelihood to reach the threshold for depression in relatives and, thus, might cause the familial aggregation of depression. Up to now, no study investigated the possibility of a relationship between individual depressive symptoms and the familial aggregation of depression.The familial aggregation of early-onset depression (age-at-onset < 60 years, EOD) but less so of late-onset depression (LOD) has been shown in this sample. To assess the hypothesis of an inheritance of individual depressive symptoms as a possible cause of the familial aggregation of depression, frequencies of symptoms were compared in relatives of depressed patients and of controls using forward logistic regression analyses.Some individual depressive symptoms showed clustering in relatives of patients with depression, but the pattern of inheritance was inconsistent, i.e. the clustering of symptoms was different between non-depressed and depressed relatives of patients with EOD and LOD, respectively. No intra-familial clustering of specific depressive symptoms within families of depressed subjects could be observed.Due to the inconsistencies in the clustering of individual symptoms in non-depressed and depressed relatives and the lack of intra-familial clustering, the familial aggregation of depression is unlikely to be caused by the aggregation of individual depressive symptoms. An inheritance of the vulnerability for complete depressive disorders influenced by environmental factors is more likely.",

The predisposing basis for functional dysphonia can lie in the constitution of an individual, his/her professional speaking and speech behavior and/or may be personality-based. (Prolonged) psychosocial stress, vocal overstressing, unfavorable speaking habits, infection of the upper respiratory tract, inflammatory processes in the larynx, emotional life events and COSO events are considered as possible triggers. The interaction of predisposed and causal factors is unknown. Stress, overall fatigue, anxiety, depression and/or certain personality traits (which complicate or hamper coping) are considered as perpetuating factors. In any case, overlaps between voice symptoms and reactive psychic as well as social problems have to be kept in mind (e. g. the burden of suffering, depressive processing, speaking anxiety, socially withdrawal). Because the association of multiple psychosocial factors with functional dysphonia is not distinct--such are always existent in organ medically unexplained symptoms--functional dysphonia has to be diagnostically differentiated. For the purpose of the article, a psycho-diagnostic path following the ICD-10 chapter V along general lines is presented. Until now, it is unknown which psychosocial factors discriminate a psychogenic dysphonia from muscle tension dysphonia.",

      "abstract": "A consultation on the neuropsychiatric aspects of HIV-1 infection was held at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters January 11-13, 1990. Of topics discussed, participants concluded that a group of conditions characterized by cognitive and motor impairment can be described. New terminology was suggested accordingly. Participants found that otherwise health HIV-1 seropositive patients were no more likely than HIV-1 seronegative patients to manifest clinically significant cognitive impairment. The serological screening of asymptomatic patients for HIV-1 in attempts to protect public safety was therefore deemed unnecessary. Hallucinations and delusions being not infrequent in AIDS and ARC patients, they may be indicative of cognitive impairment or later accompanied by symptoms pointing to diagnosis of delirium or dementia. Acute psychotic disorders outside of evidence of cognitive impairment may result as anomalies described within the text. Depressive syndrome may result outside of severe depressive episode or major depression due to recent diagnosis as HIV-1 positive and/or as the first stage of HIV-1 dementia. DIstinguishing between ARC and the above-mentioned states as the cause of this syndrome may be difficult. Consultation participants cited stress associated with HIV-1 infection or disease to be conditioned by several factors. Finally, neuropsychiatric disorders due to HIV-1 opportunistic processes were discussed. Country-level recommendations included preparing health workers for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions in the HIV-1 positive patient, and notifying then that otherwise healthy HIV-1 positive patients may not show clinically significant signs of cognitive impairment. Recommendations followed in urging health services to prepare for a large burden of neuropsychiatric illness in AIDS and ARC patients; governments should support services and train health workers accordingly. Pre- and post-serological testing counseling was stressed, with facility for and understanding of the special needs of HIV-1 positive patients' families and involved health staff. Research on the neurological and mental health needs of patients should be given high priority with attention given to the immediate policy and care implications. Final qualification of the difficulty involved in generalizing research findings to apply across sociocultural and geographical contexts was provided with mention in the text of a WHO multicenter study addressing this concern in its pilot phase at the time of publication. Neurological tests were designed for use in this study to be culturally nonspecific.",

      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

BPD is best thought of in terms of dimensions rather than as a specific disorder. Each dimension has a biological profile and may be expressed differently in different patients. Four core elements are suggested to play a major role in the development of BPD: interpersonal stress, affective instability, impulsivity, and dissociation and self-injurious behavior. Genetic and environmental factors lead to brain alterations that are the basis for specific presentations of the disorder, such as self-injurious and impulsive aggressive behavior.",

      "title": "Evidence summary: How effective are early psychological interventions in preventing posttraumatic stress disorder in health workers exposed to traumatic scenarios in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic? [v2.1]",
      "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that health workers dealing with critical incidents or traumatic situations - particularly for an extended period - are at risk of psychological distress which, in some cases, can develop into more serious mental health problems including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Risk factors can include social isolation, stigma, or concern about family, gender or age. While the focus of attention on PTSD has been in connection with military personnel, there is increasing recognition that its effects are wider and include health workers dealing with critical incidents and prolonged exposure to disease suffering24.While there is considerable evidence relating to the treatment of PTSD, there is a paucity of studies relating to its prevention.Stein et al note the opportunity inherent in the secondary prevention of PTSD:“Whereas many other mental disorders are no doubt fed by experiential inputs and fuelledby life stressors, PTSD cannot occur in the absence of trauma. We have here the chance to catch the traumatic spark before it burns and emotionally scars. This is the promise of the secondary prevention of PTSD.”Studies have been conducted into the effectiveness of psychological interventions for the prevention of PTSD,but two Cochrane reviews35, 36have asserted that there is no conclusive evidence for either single or multiple session psychological interventionin the prevention of PTSD. Rose goes onto state that the routine use of single session debriefing may actually increase the risk pf post-traumatic stress and so cannot be supported. Roberts et al35explored the use of multiple session psychological interventions; and, although finding some beneficial effects, concluded that the poor quality of the studies would not permit any recommendation for\r\nmultiple session intervention. The concern expressed in these two reviews\r\nregarding the effectiveness of early psychological intervention for all those\r\ninvolved in the traumatic event is echoed by other studies which suggest\r\nthat interventions for the prevention of PTSD are more effective when given\r\nto those identified as being most at risk. Other authors cite the need for\r\nassessment of those at risk; and organisational planning to address\r\nmental health issues arising from trauma or disaster scenarios.\r\nSeveral studies address the prevention of PTSD and other serious mental\r\nhealth issues by emphasizing the importance of psychological interventions\r\nthat will address the issues that give rise to psychological distress among\r\nHCWs. These include CBT, psychological first aid8, resilience training at\r\nboth individual and organisational level, mindfulness training,\r\ncritical incident stress management and eye movement\r\ndesensitization and reprocessing18. Other studies also note the physical\r\nconcerns of HCWs such as the need for PPE, rest, food and sleep, the\r\nunavailability of which can give rise to psychological distress. Several\r\nauthors also focus on the benefits of social or peer support; and the\r\npotential to provide psychological interventions using technology.\r\nDue to the limited evidence relating to the current pandemic, this summary\r\nincorporates articles relating to previous pandemics and other trauma\r\nscenarios.\r\nOne commentator offers a possible way forward for researchers looking into\r\nthe effectiveness of psychological interventions in the prevention of PTSD:\r\n“What is truly remarkable about the study of traumatic stress, however, is\r\nthe resilience of human beings, the fact that the majority of individuals who\r\nare exposed to truly horrific events do not develop psychopathology.\r\nPerhaps the field of PTSD prevention needs this shift in perspective.\r\nPreventive efforts may be faltering because the quest to eradicate illness\r\nhas distracted us from first supporting health. Future prevention of PTSD\r\nmay be more likely to come from understanding the factors that create\r\nresilience and allow individuals to find growth in the most difficult of\r\ncircumstances. Interventions should be developed to support the\r\npsychological and biological processes that lead to effective coping long\r\nbefore it is necessary to address emerging psychopathology.”",

      "title": "There Are No Bad Kids: An Antiracist Approach to Oppositional Defiant Disorder",
      "abstract": "Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a childhood disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorder characterized by anger or irritability, argumentativeness or defiance, and vindictiveness (Table 1).1 Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native children—hereafter referred to as racially minoritized children—are more likely to be diagnosed with ODD than white children.2–4 One recent large-scale analysis found that the diagnosis of ODD is 35% more prevalent in Black people than in white people.5 These disparities worsen in juvenile detention and child welfare settings, where racially minoritized youth are overrepresented.6,7ODD describes the presence of unwanted behaviors and suggests they are features of the child, rather than manifestations of underlying neurodevelopmental difference (eg, autism), prior history (eg, trauma), or co-occurring mental health challenges (eg, depression).1 The diagnosis becomes racist when applied indiscriminately to racially minoritized children as a \"bad kid\" label, placing blame on them for these unwanted behaviors. Doing so is especially problematic when these behaviors serve as reactions or adaptations to racism. This misattribution can incite adverse outcomes, including missed treatment opportunities from misdiagnosis, failure to protect against racism, and harsher school disciplinary practices.2,3,8–10However, there are no specific guidelines that take an antiracist approach to protect children against this harm.11,12 This antiracist approach addresses this void, urging clinicians to recognize the historical legacy of racism shaping ODD overdiagnosis; the racism influencing diagnosis and treatment; and key documentation, psychoeducation, and clinical activism strategies.13,14 Two real-life cases illustrate how it confronts the racism shaping ODD in practical contexts (Tables 2 and 3).Aggression and defiance can be powerful transgenerational adaptations to histories and systems of oppression. Yet organized mental health has historically pathologized racially minoritized people's resistance to racial violence at the expense of denouncing racial violence itself.15 For drapetomania, or \"runaway slave syndrome,\" coined by Dr Samuel Cartwright in 1851, the recommended treatment was whipping.16 During the Civil Rights Movement, psychiatrists labeled Black men championing their human rights with a \"protest psychosis\" diagnosis.17 In both cases, more humane alternatives, like abolishing slavery, instead of whipping enslaved people, were disregarded. Notably, in the 1960s, other mental health professionals were championing racism's eradication, rather than diagnosing protest psychosis, as the definitive pathology underlying minoritized discontent.18,19 Both diagnoses reneged on a duty to advocate against social injustice.Mental health care's legacy of racism, while distinctly anti-Black due to its intertwinement with slavery, has not spared other racialized groups. Intelligence testing created by psychologists justified 20th-century eugenics mass sterilization campaigns targeting Black, Hispanic, and American Indian girls and women.20,21 This testing has contributed to racially minoritized children's overrepresentation in special education placement.22 ODD's overdiagnosis today perpetuates this legacy's normalization of racial oppression, pathologizing of resistance, and behavioral control as intervention, rather than advocacy against racial violence.13 Because diagnostic labels remain an enduring weapon of choice for white normativity, clinicians should think twice about applying ODD to racially minoritized children. Repairing this history involves challenging it, not perpetuating it.13,14An antiracist approach to racially minoritized children with ODD mandates analyzing how racism shapes misdiagnosis—not automatically implementing the adult supervision, discipline, and parent training recommended by practice parameters.11,12 Recognizing pertinent inequities helps pediatric clinicians avoid the following: Perpetuating anger and adultification biases: Adults are more likely to perceive Black children as stronger, more adultlike, less innocent, and less deserving of attention than white children.23–25 These biases, derived from anti-Black ideologies legitimizing enslaved children's abuse, persist through racially minoritized children's overpunishment, criminalization, and neglect of their pain, emotional and physical.26–28 When children are labeled oppositional, contextualization should follow. It includes scrutinizing the adult authority figures (clinicians, teachers, school administrators, and police officers) assessing them; conducting impartial assessments of their emotions and behaviors; and making ample attempts to identify dehumanization and discrimination.Ignoring intersecting systems of oppression: Adultification biases impact racially minoritized girls in unique ways.25 Negative stereotypes of Black women being angry, aggressive, and hypersexual lead adults to treat Black girls inappropriately, punishing them for subjective infractions, like disruption or disobedience, that their peers evade.23–25 They are suspended at 5 times the rate of white girls, while American Indian girls experience suspension at over twice the rate.29,30 Racially minoritized lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students often endure multiple forms of bullying and harassment and punishment for their clothing, gender presentation, and public displays of affection, leading to increased rates of disciplinary actions within school environments.31 LGBTQ girls in particular are disproportionately punished due to normative societal expectations for sexual behavior and gender identity.32,33 These inequities warrant exploring differential treatment at school (case 2) while noting ODD's gender differences. Girls experience more internalizing symptomatology than boys. ODD is more common in boys during childhood, but this gender gap narrows in adolescence.34Misdiagnosing: Mitigating racial discrimination's harm involves considering alternative diagnoses, like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder, which can present similarly to ODD.2,35 Although a defining feature of ODD, irritability is not diagnostic. A nonspecific indicator, irritability in youth warrants checking for mood and anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder.36 Clinicians requiring a diagnosis for billing but lacking time to probe for trauma, attentional challenges, and mood symptoms might consider less stigmatizing alternatives, including the various adjustment disorders or unspecified behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. The widespread practice of copying and pasting a historical diagnosis without proper assessment, which can perpetuate bias, is discouraged.37Advancing the school-to-prison trajectory: An ODD label can heighten racially minoritized children's already elevated risks of suspension, expulsion, and justice involvement.27 Black and American Indian/Alaska Native youth face higher arrest rates than white youth. Black and Hispanic youth experience the highest incarceration rates, followed by American Indian and then white youth.38,39 Racism profoundly impacts children, resulting in higher rates of anxiety, depression, and behavior problems.40–42 Racially minoritized youth who are also disabled, transgender, undocumented, or otherwise marginalized face additional toxic stress from intersectional discrimination and can be punished for their victimization.43,44 Explaining behavior through an ODD diagnosis can come at the expense of validating discrimination and trauma, thereby facilitating racially minoritized children's pushout into carceral settings for the same behaviors garnering mental health care referrals and diversion for white youth.39,45Justifying punishment and coercion: Diagnosing a racially minoritized child with ODD can be tantamount to calling them a \"bad kid,\" amplifying established patterns of punishment and coercion, like excessive suspension and expulsions, seclusion and restraint, and police stops and juvenile justice involvement.28,46,47 An antiracist approach supplants individualized constructions of problematic behavior with structural analyses of the racial violence assailing children, recognizing the latter as the core problem driving the former. Moreover, it calls for protection against it.13,14 Assessing behaviors across multiple settings and relationships helps. Putting less onus on racially minoritized children for behaviors caused by racism is therapeutic and could improve service engagement.Pediatric clinicians who have connected a racially minoritized child's ODD diagnosis to historical context and assessed its racist harm are primed to protect them through the following clinical strategies.Antiracist psychoeducation14: This strategy involves explaining to children and families how ODD's overdiagnosis can perpetuate a historical arc of racism (step 1) and thwart healthy developmental outcomes (step 2). A full informed consent process illuminates an ODD diagnosis' risks, underscoring that mental health diagnoses are not objective markers of disease but rather highly subjective constructions of human behavior shaped by historical and sociopolitical context.15Antiracist documentation14: This process involves scanning charts for pejorative language portraying children as aggressive (eg, defiant, difficult, uncooperative48) and examining whether their behaviors have been explored as a form of distress stemming from the stress and trauma of racism. Clinicians can then document the role racism plays in shaping behavior, adult authority figures' perceptions of it, and how an ODD diagnosis can cause harm by obscuring vulnerability, trauma, sadness, and attentional challenges (step 2).2 Highlighting strengths and concern for mistreatment humanizes children, rewrites their pejorative narratives, and reconfigures them as \"good kids\" deserving of care. Documenting when a child no longer meets the criteria for ODD, due to symptoms being better explained by a different diagnosis or precipitating circumstance, further mitigates bias.Clinical activism14: Pediatric clinicians extend advocacy beyond health care by redirecting psychoeducational measures toward school administrators, police officers, and court representatives and shifting antiracist documentation strategies from medical charts toward school letters and court reports. This clinical activism highlights the school-to-prison trajectory's detriment and reconfigures oppositional behavior as adaptive, rather than problematic, in the face of racism.A color-blind49 approach to ODD uses a race-neutral orientation to minimize racism's formative role in shaping children's behavior and adult authority figures' responses to it.14,15 This antiracist approach, by contrast, centers racism to protect racially minoritized children from its harm. Illuminating history and systems of oppression, rehumanizing children against bias and degradation, and pathologizing structural violence, not individuals' adaptive responses to it, are its cornerstones.16,17ODD is an example of diagnostic condemnation whereby clinicians can indict racially minoritized children instead of standing up against injustice in their defense. Other forms include the overdiagnosis of psychotic and disruptive disorders.2,50 They function as a unique form of race-based medicine51 whereby race is an unnamed diagnostic variable. More research is needed about ODD's impact when the diagnosis does not contextualize symptoms amid racism or becomes punitive when lacking diagnostic reliability, as depicted in the 2 cases (Tables 2 and 3). Exploring this issue might illuminate whether this diagnosis should exist at all.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The intensive treatment of six suicidal patients has been used to explore the relationships among object loss, the mourning process, and suicide. These relationships may be condensed in two propositions: (a) suicidal behavior stems from an arrested grief reaction in which the subject is unable to complete the process of mourning for a lost object; and (b) the suicide's pathological loss reaction is brought about by developmental defects, primarily deficiencies in self‐love and individuation. The suicidal subject's mournïng reaction is arrested in one or more of the first three stages of grief: shock, protest, or detachment from the lost object.",

Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure.

Although Asperger's disorder is an illness that begins in childhood, its diagnosis may frequently not be done until later stages. The case presented is about a 21 year old man with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder who, after several admissions, was sent to the Rehabilitation Hospital Unit for stabilization and diagnostic study given the atypical features of his case. The psychopathological examination showed disorders in social relationships, psychomotricity and communications that had begun in his childhood. All these data, and the results of the biomedical and psychological diagnostic tests oriented us towards the presence of a dual diagnosis of Asperger's disorder and schizoaffective disorder. The presence of common symptoms between the AD and other psychiatric diseases as well as the possible existence of comorbidity may lead to an incorrect or late diagnosis.",

La hiperactividad es un trastorno del desarrollo de la conducta caracterizado por una actividad motora disruptiva que impide que el individuo establezca los lazos sociales adecuados y se comunique con normalidad, parte esencial del desarrollo global del nino. Es un sintoma inespecifico de diversos trastornos neurocognitivos. El mas frecuente es el trastorno por deficit de atencion con hiperactividad (TDAH). Pacientes y metodos. Se presenta el resultado de dos investigaciones. En la primera de ellas, un estudio caso-control, se analizo de forma comparativa como recuerdan el comportamiento de sus hijos durante los primeros 12 meses de vida los padres de 50 ninos diagnosticados de TDAH. Se separo la sintomatologia en 3 perfiles clinicos (irritabilidad diurna, trastornos en las conductas alimentarias y disfunciones del sueno). Hasta el 33% de las familias referia antecedentes de alguno de ellos. El 41% de los ninos fueron descritos como excesivamente inquietos, llorones o irritables, y muy sensibles a los ruidos y sobresaltos, y el 42,7% tuvo dificultad para dormirse o manifesto sueno intermitente y despertares con llanto. Para el segundo proyecto de investigacion, complementario al anterior, se diseno una encuesta anamnesica que respondieron los padres de 78 pacientes diagnosticados de TDAH. El cuestionario recogia la informacion sobre los primeros 5 anos de la vida en 4 apartados (28 items): las conductas durante el primer ano de la vida, el desarrollo psicomotor, el desarrollo del juego, y la percepcion general de los padres sobre su hijo (despistado-inatento, impulsivo, destructor, inmaduro, negativista, oposicional, otro). Mediante el modelo matematico de Rasch se obtuvo el perfil clinico de la casuistica. Conclusiones. La semiologia clinica se presenta en un continuo durante los primeros anos de la vida.

      "abstract": "The question if there are \"symptomatic schizophrenias\" has been discussed since the 20s. Schizophrenic psychoses caused be definable and well known brain diseases are presented. All schizophrenic symptoms and syndromes, the first rank symptoms (K. Schneider) too, occur in somatically founded psychoses. The group of paroxysmal transition syndromes in the sense of aura prolongata (continua) and the episodic schizophrenic psychoses in psychomotor epilepsy may be a model for the schizophrenia research. Vital threatening, so-called pernicious catatonic schizophrenias are found on the basis of infectious brain diseases, sometimes only diagnosed in autopsy. Beside acute and reversible symptomatic schizophrenic psychoses there are, even if rarely, recurrent and chronic courses of symptomatic schizophrenias. That certain conditions for the developing of symptomatic schizophrenias are rarely realised, could be an explanation for their rarity. Some findings indicate that the limbic system is significant for symptomatic (and idiopathic) schizophrenic psychoses and the pre- and postpsychotic basic stages determined by dynamic and cognitive basic symptoms, which are phenomenologically very similar to aura symptoms released by stereoelectroencephalographic depth recordings (Wieser). The characteristic features of marked fluctuation, discontinuity and insteadiness of the cognitive thought, perception, psychomotor and cenesthetic phenomena do not speak against an organic brain disorder provided that the traditional process hypothesis is abandoned in favor of a neurobiochemic disorder, fluctuating on its part depending on endogenous as well as psychic-reactive factors.",

Semakin awal terjadinya skizofrenia, maka prognosis semakin buruk. Gejala awal yang sering tidak terlihat dan perkembangan gejala yang bertahap mengakibatkan sangat sulit untuk menegakkan diagnosa skizofrenia pada anak. Kesulitan menegakkan diagnosis ini juga diakibatkan karena anak sering tidak dapat menceritakan gangguan yang dialaminya pada orang lain, sehingga sering dianggap sebagai gangguan perkembangan perilaku. Setelah menunjukkan perubahan perilaku, diagnosis skizofrenia pada anak mungkin baru bisa ditegakkan beberapa bulan atau beberapa tahun kemudian. Hal ini juga diakibatkan karena orangtua sering tidak mempercayai gangguan psikotik pada anak mereka. Namun berbagai upaya dapat dilakukan untuk dapat mengetahui deteksi dini dan penegakan diagnosa yang tepat, misalnya dengan melakukan pemeriksaan-pemeriksaan yang umum dilakukan pada skizofrenia dan pemeriksaan\r\ntambahan yang sering dilakukan pada pasien skizofrenia anak, misalnya menggambar, bermain dan menceritakan mimpi.

      "title": "What does it Mean to be Rational?",
      "abstract": "Rationality can be broadly categorized into two types: rationality of action, which concerns behavior appropriate to achieving one's goals, and theoretical rationality, which involves conformity to norms, such as logical or social norms. Many philosophers and psychologists, including Graham, argue that a key aspect of mental disorder is a deficiency in rational control over one's behavior. This notion aligns with common perceptions that mental illness involves a lack of discipline or self-control. Contrary to popular belief, individuals with mental disorders may not necessarily demonstrate impaired rationality. Studies on schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders suggest that individuals with these conditions can reason logically within their symptomatic domains and may even outperform non-disordered individuals in certain tasks. For instance, individuals with schizophrenia may exhibit logical reasoning and resistance to cognitive biases. Similarly, individuals with depression may demonstrate a more realistic outlook, devoid of positive illusions commonly found in mentally healthy individuals. Furthermore, individuals with anxiety disorders, such as phobias or obsessive-compulsive disorder, may display expert-level reasoning within their symptomatic domains, utilizing strategies like the Better Safe than Sorry or the semidialectic reasoning. Overall, the distinction between normal and pathological cognition cannot be solely based on rationality, as both groups exhibit similar patterns of cognitive processes and reasoning. Mental disorders involve complex interactions between cognitive processes and social factors, challenging traditional notions of rationality as a defining characteristic of mental health. In the second part of this chapter, we explore the roots of stigma, attributing it to both automatic and deliberate psychological processes. These processes lead to negative associations and attributions of responsibility to those with mental disorders, perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination. Furthermore, fear of contagion, unpredictability, and the belief that mentally ill individuals pose a threat to oneself contribute to stigmatization. Personal accounts highlight the dehumanizing effects of stigma, where individuals labeled as mentally ill face discrimination, abuse, and loss of identity. Moreover, the internalization of stigma can lead to low self-esteem and diminished quality of life. We conclude the book by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the rationality within madness and challenging societal attitudes toward mental illness. Reframing mental disorder involves acknowledging the humanity and dignity of individuals with mental illnesses, rather than perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination.",

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Dissociation is a ubiquitous clinical phenomenon. Dissociative disorders (DD) are primarily characterized by dissociation, and dissociative states are also a criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative reactions such as depersonalization/derealization and amnesia (e.g., gaps in awareness/memory) across diagnostic categories are believed to be affect contingent and theorized to serve affect regulation functions. What is not clear, however, is how self-reported affect and physiological reactivity unfold within dissociative episodes. To address this issue, the present project aims to investigate the hypothesis (1) whether self-reported distress (as indicated by arousal, e.g., feeling tense/agitated, and/or valence, e.g., feeling discontent/unwell) and physiological reactivity increase before dissociative episodes and (2) whether self-reported distress and physiological reactivity decrease during and after dissociative episodes in a transdiagnostic sample of patients with DD, BPD, and/or PTSD. Methods and analyses: We will use a smartphone application to assess affect and dissociation 12 times per day over the course of one week in everyday life. During this time, heart and respiratory rates will be remotely monitored. Afterwards, participants will report affect and dissociative states eight times in the laboratory before, during, and after the Trier Social Stress Test. During the laboratory task, we will continuously record heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory rate, as well as measure blood pressure and take salivary samples to determine cortisol levels. Our hypotheses will be tested using multilevel structural equation models. Power analyses determined a sample size of 85.",

      "title": "Suicide risk in systemic lupus erythematosus: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;: the restrictions imposed by the disease and the perception of personal and social losses related to its course, despite the medical and scientific advances, reinforce fear and generate intense suffering in lupus patients. Psychiatric comorbidities, especially major depressive episodes, are highly prevailing during the course of systemic lupus erythematosus. Among them, suicide is a behavior that is much more common then we believe. &lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;: to perform a narrative review on suicidal behavior associated with systemic erythematosus lupus (SLE). &lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: studies have shown an increased risk of suicide among patients with chronic diseases and psychiatric disorder, especially depression. However, suicide occurrence cannot be attributed only to a higher prevalence of depression and other mental illnesses. It is necessary to learn more about the suicide risk factors that can be present in patients with lupus to work on a secondary prevention, and avoid not only the premature loss of lives but also the additional suffering of families and surrounding communities. The coordination between the studies on suicidal behavior and its complex network of individual and sociocultural factors and the studies on this multisystem autoimmune disease with a wide manifestation spectrum, which is lupus, creates a new and important field of research. &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: non-psychiatrist office-based physicians, health clinics, or wards dedicated to the treatment of SLE should be able to recognize and handle the suicide risk factors on their patients in order to reduce the suffering caused by this disease.",

      "abstract": "Motivation literally means 'to be driven to do something' and refers to processes dealing with the origin and maintenance of the target behavior. Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree, distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required. Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is sensory perception disorder, namely hallucinations which are typical of mental disorders in individuals characterized by changes in sensory perception, by feeling false sensations in the form of sounds (hearing), sight, taste, touch, or smell. Mental disorders are syndromes or patterns of behavior that are clinically significant that are associated with distress or suffering and pose obstacles to one or more functions of human life. One that includes mental disorders is schizophrenia. Hallucinations are false perceptual distortions that occur in maladaptive neurobiological responses, sufferers actually experience sensory distortions as real things and respond accordingly.

A volume reduction and/or activity decrease of frontal brain structures associated with impulse control and the regulation of fear and anger are likewise found in combination with a fear-related hyperactivity of the amygdala.

Conversely, proactive-instrumental violent offender with psychopathy, who are characterized by a lack of empathy and remorse, demonstrate an autonomic hypo-responsivity as well as dysfunctions of the amygdala and of cortical regions related to empathic and social behavior. Developmentally, aggressive children exhibit temperamental differences from early childhood on that are characteristic of a developmental pathway towards either reactive or proactive violence later in life. Exposure to negative environmental factors like ineffective parenting or childhood maltreatment has been related to a heightened risk for developing reactive violence.

      "abstract": "At present there is no consensus on defining “Recovery” in schizophrenia,while there is an accepted definition of “Remission”. Remission model considers “stability” the treatment primary goal and, once achieved, focus is on mainteining stability and preventing relapse. This model reflects a condition where are absent prominent symptoms but may be present some mild symptoms of schizophrenia, retaining not realistic absence of any symptoms. It would require treating an acute psychotic episode,then there still may be a range of no detectable or persistent and disabling symptoms:remission and level of functioning are related but not the same. Some patients could have good level of functioning despite persistent symptoms and others could meet remission criteria despite considerable impairments. Remission is an obteinable outcome for many psychotic outpatients:the point of departure between manteinance and recovery-oriented model happens only after “stability” is achieved;no one could recover in face of repeated crisis,hospitalisation or unrelenting psychotic symptoms. Unfortunately two causes have resulted in a relative neglect of the concept of recovery from psychotic illness:the divide between mainstream biologically oriented psychiatry and the psychiatric rehabilitation movement;the misunderstanding fact that term “recovery movement” is sometimes construed as anti-medication or anti-psychiatry orientation. Irrefuteble point is that recovery model not rejects the importance of remission:stability and relapse prevention. The recovery model besides asserts that achieving remission is the beginning and not the end of treatment plan:then there will be continued efforts to work with patient,family,caregiver,to continue to achieve further improvements in life goals. The “Recovery” patient-centred model have to be embraced as prymary goal by mainstream organizations and services in Mental Health.",

For this reason, the stigma of society has an impact on the families of sufferers because they think that if one of the families suffers from a mental disorder, it is something that is very embarrassing and is a disgrace to the family. One of the many psychiatric disorders is schizophrenia where the sufferer has difficulty distinguishing what is real and what is not. The existence of this thinking disorder makes the sufferer have abnormalities in behaving and speaking. Families who care for people with schizophrenia also receive bad treatment by the surrounding environment so that it affects their perception of schizophrenia itself. Not infrequently the family also becomes a victim when caring for the patient and of course makes the sufferer's family feel depressed. For this reason, self-acceptance from the family will have an impact and can also help the healing process for people with schizophrenia.

The authors present some case studies of personality disorders, in which the principal symptom at admission was violent behavior.

      "title": "Psychiatric conditions",
      "abstract": "In reviewing psychiatric syndromes, some themes recur. This does not lead to a general theory of disorder, but to an analysis that has some general features. Set against a developmental background, disorder is viewed in relation to the tasks that must be achieved where multiple sets of mental rules are possible. These include the monitoring of internal and interpersonal rules, the maintenance of the individual's experience of continuity in the presence of multiple states of mind, and the capacity to understand the mental states and actions of others. Many of the overarching, metarepresentational functions could also be characterized as functions of the self, and these appear to be disrupted in conditions that are as widely different as schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. In schizophrenia the monitoring of the individual's own thoughts or actions may be impaired, whilst in borderline functioning the continuity of states of mind is undermined. If the sense of self is derived from the awareness of being the author of one's own actions or thoughts over time, then in these conditions it is undermined in different ways. Inasmuch as the coherence of the self is in turn central to action, disturbances of action are the result of these different forms of disruption of the self.In both condition, further contrasting factors may undermine action. In schizophrenia inefficient information processing may lead either to action based on incidental aspects of a situation, or to inaction based on information overload. In borderline personality disorder experiences in which action has been impossible may lead to action turned on itself, in self injury. However, in both, there may be elements that represent the attempt to preserve action in the face of such threats. In schizophrenia delusions and hallucinations may in part be compensatory mechanisms that reduce uncertainty, hence providing the basis for action. In borderline personality disorder the splitting of mental representations may similarly, by excluding elements that are incompatible with action, provide (partial) representations that provide the basis for action. Thus in both conditions elements of accurate representation are sacrificed, in order for action to continue.Conditions in which action is preserved may be contrasted with those, such as depression, where it is not. In either case a range of intentional and non-intentional origins may be envisaged. In situations of helplessness depression may be seen to be an appropriate and accurate representation that action is not possible. Depression seen in the absence of such threat may result from the intrusion of cognitive and emotional states that undermine action arising from a physical, non-intentional interruption of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, or actions. Equally depression may arise where mental representations that have been maintained inactive or out of consciousness are activated, and are incompatible with action.We conclude by revisiting our starting point. Mental entities, perceptions, feelings, thoughts, and wishes are genuinely causal and must provide sufficient certainty that the individual can act effectively. Throughout biology, intentional states of organisms, from the simplest cellular creatures to non-human primates, have provided the basis for action, and in general the certainty has been derived from the evolution of those intentional states over long periods of time. In this and the preceding chapters we have seen how, in the activities of the human mind there is an infinite elaboration of the potential inherent in all intentional processes in biology. This has introduced novelty, creativity, and flexibility, that are seen in the achievements of language, custom, technology, and culture. It has also increased the risks of uncertainty, confusion, and the undermining of action. These are reduced through an interplay between the sophisticated integrative capacities of the human brain and the continuities of human relationships, skills, beliefs, and social organizations. Disorder is found in the failure of intentional states to underpin action, where these are undermined by the external world, or where intentional states are distorted, contradictory or unintegrated, and where action is undermined or ineffective.",

      "title": "Differential diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder: Self‐concept, identity and self‐esteem",
      "abstract": "Abstract Symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder (BD) often overlap. In some cases, it is difficult to conduct a differential diagnosis based only on current diagnostic criteria Therefore, it is important to find clinical factors with high discriminatory specificity that, used together with structured or semi‐structured interviews, could help improve diagnostic practice. We propose that a clinical analysis of identity, self‐concept and self‐esteem may help distinguish the two disorders, when they are not co‐morbid. Our review of the studies that analyse these constructs in BD and BPD, separately, points in the direction of qualitative differences between the two disorders. In BPD, there is a well‐documented identity diffusion, and the self‐concept appears predominantly negative; shifts in self‐concept and self‐esteem are often tied to interpersonal triggers. In BD, patients struggle with their identity, but narrative identity might be less compromised compared with BPD; the shifts in self‐concept and self‐esteem appear more linked to internal (i.e. mood and motivational) factors. We end the paper by discussing the implications for clinicians and ideas for future comparative research.",

The individual must be ill for at least 6 months and need not be psychotically active during that time. Schizophrenia is classified into several types. Enforcement of the type of diagnosis of schizophrenia can be established through history taking in the patient and family, then a diagnosis is made according to ICD-10. Treatment can be in the form of pharmacological or psychosocial therapy.&#x0D; Case Reports: A 32-year-old male patient came with his family, the patient looked anxious. The patient comes with the main complaint that he is often angry because he often hears voice whispers. The patient also complains of rapid mood changes. According to the family, this has been happening since 2015. He had been on treatment for a while but only got better shortly after that it came back again.&#x0D; Conclusion: Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder in which the patient does not have contact with reality which is characterized by major disturbances in thoughts and emotions and experiences delusions and hallucinations. Schizophrenia can be treated using antipsychotics and psychosocial. The prognosis of patients with schizophrenia depends on family support.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of parental deprivation and \"broken homes\" was found to be very similar among individuals suffering from dementia præcox, manic-depressive psychosis, alcoholic state, and \"other psychoses,\" and in normal control subjects. However, it was significantly higher in psychoneurotics and psychopathic personalities. With respect to causes of deprivation, it was noted that mental illness constituted a significant source of parental deprivation in 2 groups only—dementia præcox and manic-depressive psychosis. Divorce, separation, or desertion occurred most frequently in the parents of psychopathic personalities and psychoneurotics. Statistics concerning the age at which deprivation occurred and the parent lost did not exhibit any significant trend. There was apparent tendency for increased incidence of parental deprivation in schizophrenic patients whose illness occurred before the age of 20. The incidence of various types of psychiatric abnormalities was almost identical in the siblings of both deprived and nondeprived patients. The type of psychiatric illness in siblings paralleled that found in the hospitalized patients. It is concluded that the incidence of dementia præcox is unrelated to known external stresses or deprivations. These data lend further support to the etiological importance of heredo-constitutional factors in the development of the major psychoses. Dementia præcox is regarded as a biological deficiency disease based on heredo- constitutional factors. This concept should not lead to an attitude of therapeutic nihilism.",

      "abstract": "A number of behavioral, social, biological, and cultural factors are associated with suicide. However, the ability to predict an imminent suicide attempt remains problematic. Prior studies indicate that the manifest dream content of depressed, non-suicidal patients differs from that of depressed, suicidal patients. The dream imagery of depressed, suicidal patients contains themes of death, dying, violence, and departure. The dream imagery of depressed, non-suicidal patients contains themes of rejection, helplessness, hopelessness, humiliation, failure, and loss. In the present study, the dream reports of 52 depressed patients were collected and rated for various themes. Patients were divided into three groups: Depressed and non-suicidal; Depressed, with suicidal ideation; Depressed, with suicidal ideation and/or attempt(s). Themes of death and/or dying, and to a lesser extent, themes of violence, injury, and/or murder occurred with greater frequency in the dream reports of depressed patients with suicidal ideation and/or attempts, than in the dream reports of depressed patients without suicidal ideation or behavior. These observations correspond with the prevailing psychodynamic explanation of suicide; namely, that it is a murderous attack on the self that is identified with hated internalized objects.",

      "title": "Organic mood disorder: Sequelae of small vessel disease",
      "abstract": "Sir, Bipolar disorder predominantly begins in young adults, with evidence of bimodal presentation with a second peak in late life, i.e., beyond 50 years, wherein diagnosis is difficult.[1] Cerebrovascular lesions, ischemic variety, may be one of the etiological causes for such neuropsychiatric complication, and small vessel involvement may not present with typical stroke syndrome. 2 We present here a mood disorder, manic type secondary to small vessel disease. A 64-year-old female was brought with complaints of memory disturbances and irritable behavior for 1 year. Onset was noted with giddiness and one episode with fall associated with loss of consciousness. She was managed conservatively for this. During the last 1 month, she developed agitation in the form of singing and dancing, at times noticed to be muttering to self with inadequate sleep. She would claim that she is as good as “Lata Mangeshkar” in singing. Hence, she was referred to our unit. Other symptoms were overtalkativeness, jocularity, and irritable mood. She would make inappropriate comments (about her increased sexual urges) in front of relatives and accuse the husband of infidelity. Comorbidities were diabetes mellitus and hypertension. No history of psychiatric illness in the patient (prior to this episode) or her first-degree family relatives was elicited. No history of convulsions/seizures was elicited. On mental status examination, she had increased psychomotor activity, appeared overfamiliar, and overdressed. She was distractible with pressure of speech. She had delusion of infidelity and delusion of grandiosity claiming to have superpowers and having the most melodious voice in all over India. She also claimed God, and various actors were speaking to her directly, inferred as auditory hallucinations. Her mood was elated and irritable, but her affect was stable. Her judgment was impaired. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Neurological evaluation was normal. Clinical testing for the frontal lobe showed impaired alternate hand sequence and a lack of concern, suggesting dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal area dysfunction. She performed well on clinical parietal lobe testing. Her mini-mental status score was 16 out of 30. Since the patient was inattentive, these findings are to be interpreted with caution. Neuropsychological evaluation and neurological intervention could not be done due to the patient's uncooperativeness. Computerized tomography of the brain showed scattered ischemic foci in the bilateral frontal periventricular and left posterior parietal subcortical white matter and bilateral posterior capsule-ganglionic white matter. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain also showed multiple small ischemic foci scattered in the bilateral subcortical and periventricular deep white matter in the frontoparietal regions and associated mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. She was started on tablet sodium valproate 200 mg BD in view of irritability and impulsivity. Tablet aripiprazole 2.5 mg per day was added in view of mood-congruent psychotic symptoms, behavioral problems, and safer cardiac profile.[3] On increasing to 5 mg over a week, improvement of almost 50% was reported with decreased irritability although the delusion of infidelity and delusion of grandiosity persisted but with lesser intensity. The patient tolerated valproate well, and levels were not estimated. Cerebral small vascular disease, of the gray and white matter, is a group of pathological process with myriad etiology.[4] Classical strokes such as hemiplegia may not be seen in lacunar and white matter lesions.[56] Although responsible for ischemic strokes in 25% of cases, the manifestations vary, such as the disorders of sensation, movement, sight, speech, balance, and coordination depending on the location of the lesion.[78] We diagnosed her as an organic mood disorder secondary to the small vessel disease. This was considered due to the temporal relationship of the disinhibition, talkativeness, grandiosity with long-standing history of hypertension, history of falls as probable presentation of the lacunar infarcts, absence of past or family history of mood disorder, consistent features of behavioral change due injury to the frontal lobe and impaired functioning on clinical testing, and radiological findings justifying the deficits. Late-onset mood disorder in the elderly is less reported and devoid of guidelines for its management.[9] A small vessel disease with such a presentation may be missed, as it may be devoid of a classical stroke-like presentation with neurological deficits. Further volume of data is necessary for understanding the relationship between such vascular lesions, consequential loss of function, and the ensuing presentations of mood episodes in the elderly.

Some patients have serious clinical manifestations, such as congenital heart defects, dysplastic kidneys, severe mental retardation and leukemia. A wide spectrum of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral difficulties occur in patients with Sotos syndrome, who have a high risk of developing attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity disorder, and temper tantrums. Other cases have been described in which affected children have feeding and sleeping problems, phobias, and irritability. Many Sotos syndrome children exhibit adaptive problems in social functioning, and some present autistic features. In this study authors present a 30-year-old woman with Sotos syndrome and behavioural difficulties. The patient had Sotos syndrome diagnosed at childhood, with typical facial gestalt, macrocephaly, advanced bone age, scoliosis, kidney abnormalities, pulmonary chronic disease and migraine. At the age of 26 she developed irritability with marked impulsivity, episodes of agressivity and later of self-harm (skin-picking). She was treated with atypical anti-psychotics with positive clinical response. Clinical and laboratory examinations should be performed to prevent and manage any unusual medical aspect of the syndrome. Facial gestalt and macrocephaly, rather than advanced bone age, are the strongest indications for clinical diagnosis.",

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children.

A longstanding belief that patients with epilepsy exhibit increased aggression and are prone to violence was proposed by a number of early studies including studies noting an increased incidence of epilepsy in prisoner populations.1 The description of bizarre though stereotyped behaviors during some seizures, particularly of frontal lobe origin2 and the not infrequent use of epilepsy as a courtroom defense strategy for violent crime,3 continue to perpetuate this belief. While the association between epilepsy and aggression remains in question, it continues to contribute to public perception and amplifies the stigma associated with the disease.\n\nWhile it is unclear that patients with epilepsy exhibit increased aggression, aggressive acts have been seen in association with seizures themselves. Most commonly, aggression may occur in the postictal state and can be seen even hours to days after initial periods of confusion.4 In particular, directed, postictal violent behavior may be seen in association with postictal psychosis.5 Rarely violent behavior may be part of the seizure itself, and when aggressive behavior occurs, typical characteristics of seizures must also be present including abrupt …",

It can become chronic if the patient finds no relief from social stress or becomes dependent upon medical services as a source of support. When this is recognized, psychotherapeutic intervention is necessary. Although no socioeconomic group is exempt, hypochondriasis in the elderly occurs more often among the lower social classes. Its higher prevalence in this group is attributable to the frequency and severity of social stress and the loss of alternative social opportunities. If psychotherapeutic intervention is necessary, the elderly hypochondriac patient should be helped to recognize social stress as a major source of the problem and to develop a realistic method of coping with it. Apparently the precipitating factors are often in the socioeconomic sphere; hence, social planners should be aware of this fact if the demands on the health care system are to be reduced.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Abnormal offenders were classified as primary or secondary psychopaths, or as conforming or inhibited nonpsychopaths by means of empirically derived dimensions of psychopathy and social withdrawal. Measures of electrocortical, electrodermal, and cardiovascular activity were taken during rest, during repeated auditory stimulation, and during the cold pressor test. Psychopaths were not significantly differentiated from nonpsychopaths, but several differences were found between primary and secondary psychopaths. Primary psychopaths were more aroused cortically and electrodermally, and showed less rapid adaptation and habituation. Secondary psychopaths were the least aroused and showed signs of increasing drowsiness with repetitive stimulation. Secondary psychopaths in this study performed like primary or undifferentiated psychopaths in other reports, and possible explanations are discussed. The high arousal of primary psychopaths is not consistent with current theories of psychopathy, and attention to the relationship between psychopathy and the labelling of arousal is suggested.",

      "title": "Drawing the Line Between Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The schizo-obsessive spectrum has been a central focus of interest and research within the scientific community in mental health. The increased comorbidity of schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) appears to be considerably higher than previously expected, with more recent studies suggesting growing prevalence rates. Despite this phenomenon, OCS are not considered primary manifestations of schizophrenia and are therefore not usually explored in these patients. The concept of schizo-obsessiveness mostly emerged in the 1990s, progressing into OCD-schizophrenia spectrum disorders as a dual diagnosis of OCD and schizophrenia. The manifestations of the schizo-obsessive spectrum are diverse, and its diagnoses may be divided overall into four main categories: schizophrenia with OCS; schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) with OCD; OCD with poor insight; schizo-obsessive disorder (SOD). In some cases, distinguishing an intrusive thought from delirium in OCD with poor insight might be challenging. Poor or absent insight can be present in many diagnoses of OCD. Those patients within the schizo-obsessive spectrum present a worse insight than those with OCD without schizophrenia. The comorbidity has important clinical implications, considering its association with an earlier onset of the disorder, more severe positive and negative psychotic symptoms, a greater cognitive deficit, more severe depressive symptoms, more suicide attempts, a reduced social network, increased psychosocial dysfunction, and consequently a worse quality of life and greater psychological suffering. The presence of OCS or OCD in schizophrenia may lead to more severe psychopathology and a worse prognosis. More precise diagnoses allow for a more targeted intervention by offering an optimized psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological approach. We hereby present four clinical cases that represent each of the four designated categories of the schizo-obsessive spectrum. This case-series report aims to enhance clinical insight regarding the diversity of the schizo-obsessive spectrum and to illustrate the difficult and sometimes misleading process of differentiating OCD from schizophrenia and establishing a diagnosis due to the potential overlap of phenomenology, as well as the course and assessment of symptoms manifested within the spectrum.",

Se considera que es normal la aparicion de algunas de estas afectaciones durante y despues de ocurrida la situacion, como parte de la elaboracion del trauma. Sin embargo, si las reacciones cognitivas, conductuales, afectivas y fisiologicas persisten por mas tiempo de lo que se esperaria, interfiriendo en su vida familiar, social y laboral, disminuyendo paulatinamente su calidad de vida, podriamos pensar en el desarrollo de otros sindromes y trastornos; siendo el sindrome de estres traumatico secundario y el trastorno por estres postraumatico los mas comunes. Con el conocimiento de estas afectaciones se pretende en primer lugar favorecer el apoyo psicologico brindado al personal de primera respuesta antes, durante y despues de las emergencias y desastres. En segundo lugar, proponemos colaborar en el desarrollo de la investigacion en el campo de la Psicologia en Emergencias y Desastres. La revision del tema conduce a una comprension del que y como acontece con el ser humano -en tales circunstancias- con vistas a poder ofrecer valoraciones de los posibles impactos y repercusiones psicologicas y sociales, que facilitara disenar programas de acompanamiento, psicoeducacion u otros en esta area.",

The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

The situation becomes critical when the fantasies are dramatized in real life with an unsuspecting and usually unwilling man cast in the role of the lover.

      "title": "Violent crimes and their relationship to personality disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Persons committing murder and other forms of violent crime are likely to exhibit a personality disorder (PD) of one type or another. Essentially any personality disorder can be associated with violent crime, with the possible exception of avoidant PD. This includes those described in DSM as well as other disorders such as sadistic PD and psychopathy. The latter two, along with antisocial and paranoid PDs, are the most common personality accompaniments of violent crime. Narcissistic traits (if not narcissistic PD (NPD) itself) are almost universal in this domain, since violent offenders usually place their own desires and urges far above those of other persons. While admixtures of traits from several disorders are common among violent offenders, certain ones are likely to be the main disorder: antisocial PD, Psychopathy, Sadistic PD, Paranoid PD and NPD. Instrumental (as opposed to impulsive) spousal murders are strongly associated with NPD. Men committing serial sexual homicide usually show psychopathy and sadistic PD; half these men also show schizoid PD. Mass murderers usually show strong paranoid traits. With a focus on murder, clinical examples drawn from the crime literature and from the author's personal interviews reflect 14 varieties of personality disorder. Animal torture before adulthood is an important predictor of future violent (including sadistic) crime. Whereas many antisocial persons are eventually capable of rehabilitation, this is rarely the case with psychopathic or sadistic persons. Suggestions for future research are offered.

Some did so perhaps in the expectation that mental disturbances arising out of war experiences would show specific clinical characteristics; others used it without any particular theoretical premises and without any particular sense of responsibility. The difficulties in the way of diagnosis in certain cases could be reduced to two main factors: ignorance or insufficient knowledge of the patients' language and its nuances and the social and cultural characteristics of the level of their prewar life. Clinical psychiatry has hitherto restricted itself to describing the symptoms under each main classification as primary or secondary, but has had no or only very superficial explanations to offer of the psychical mechanism of the individual symptoms.

      "title": "Mood disorders in adults with epilepsy: a review of unrecognized facts and common misconceptions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic conditions. Its clinical manifestations are not restricted to seizures but often include cognitive disturbances and psychiatric disorders. Prospective population-based studies have shown that people with epilepsy have an increased risk of developing mood disorders, and people with a primary mood disorder have an increased risk of developing epilepsy. The existence of common pathogenic mechanisms in epilepsy and mood disorders may explain the bidirectional relation between these two conditions. Recognition of a personal and family psychiatric history at the time of evaluation of people for a seizure disorder is critical in the selection of antiseizure medications: those with mood-stabilizing properties (e.g., lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine) should be favoured as a first option in those with a positive history while those with negative psychotropic properties (e.g., levetiracetam, topiramate) avoided. While mood disorders may be clinically identical in people with epilepsy, they often present with atypical manifestations that do not meet ICD or DSM diagnostic criteria. Failure to treat mood disorders in epilepsy may have a negative impact, increasing suicide risk and iatrogenic effects of antiseizure medications and worsening quality of life. Treating mood disorders in epilepsy is identical to those with primary mood disorders. Yet, there is a common misconception that antidepressants have proconvulsant properties. Most antidepressants are safe when prescribed at therapeutic doses. The incidence of seizures is lower in people randomized to antidepressants than placebo in multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trials of people treated for a primary mood disorder. Thus, there is no excuse not to prescribe antidepressant medications to people with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "In persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), aberrant sensory perceptions could be as characteristic and disruptive as the presence of anomalies in social communication and interaction or restricted and repetitive interests. Most of them present sensory modulation disorders (hyper- or hypo-responsiveness) in several sensory channels. Furthermore, there is a deficit in the integration of the information from a number of sensory systems (for example, auditory and visual). All this would worsen the core symptoms related with communication and increase the appearance of behavioural problems.This study aims to review the experimental evidence that addresses the role played by the prefrontal cortex in unusual sensory experiences in ASD and its involvement in social aspects. There is evidence of hypoactivation and dysfunction of the neural networks, which include the prefrontal cortex and participate in social cognition, such as the default mode and the mirror neuron system in children with ASD.Sensory-motor problems at an early age correspond to a disruption in the organisation and regulation not only of perception and action but also language, thought, emotion and even memory.Papel de la corteza prefrontal en los problemas sensoriales de los niños con trastornos del espectro autista y su implicacion en los aspectos sociales.Introduccion. En las personas con trastornos del espectro autista (TEA), las percepciones sensoriales aberrantes podrian ser tan caracteristicas y disruptivas como la presencia de anomalias en la comunicacion e interaccion social, asi como de intereses restringidos y repetitivos.

Ademas, muestra un deficit en la integracion de la informacion procedente de varios sistemas sensoriales (por ejemplo, auditivo y visual).

Patients with schizophrenia commonly experience debilitating social and occupational impairments, but some are able to function well with proper treatment. Symptom onset is generally between late adolescence and the mid-30s. There are two categories of symptoms: positive and negative. Hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech are examples of positive symptoms, whereas decreased emotional expression and lack of motivation are negative symptoms. Antipsychotic medications can treat some symptoms of schizophrenia but are associated with multiple adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms and metabolic changes. Patients receiving antipsychotic medications, especially second-generation (or atypical) antipsychotics, should be monitored regularly for metabolic changes and cardiovascular risk factors. Persons with schizophrenia who undergo psychosocial therapy in addition to medical therapy have better outcomes. Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have a higher overall mortality rate than the general public, partly because of the increased suicide risk associated with schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

      "title": "Sensory Deprivation in Geriatric Patients",
      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

      "abstract": "Living with end stage organ failure and transplantation has implications for physiological, psychological, and social well-being. The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome. Therapeutic interventions include cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on exploration of attitudes toward hope and meaning in life.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdolescence is recognized as an age of difficulties caused by rapid physical, emotional, intellectual and social changes that accompany it. Adolescents struggle and face newly encountered obstacles such as awkwardness, self discovery, independence, educational demands and puberty. This period is a critical period and needs lot of emotional regulatory skill development.Emotional Intelligence is defined as a major part of an individual's character that includes abilities such as being able (i) to motivate oneself (ii) persist in the face of frustrations (iii) to control impulses for (iv) to delay gratifications (v) to regulate moods (vi) to keep distress from swamping the ability to think (vii) to empathize and (viii) to hope.People with low emotional intelligence display behaviors and characteristics like poor impulse control, low self esteem, depression and suicidal feelings, aggressive behavior and self harm, increased stress, increased alcohol and drug use and even personality disorder due to insufficient ability to manage their emotions. In contrast, high emotional intelligence has been linked with increased well-being such as greater satisfaction with life and increased happiness.Quality emotions and feelings help students give their best potential in the classroom. The students who think negatively cannot concentrate for a long time and have more difficulty in reaching their potential than others.Family system is where the child learns when and how to express feelings, manage conflict, and negotiate differences. The general climate of the family will teach the child certain norms, values, and interpersonal skills. Family in general and parents in particular, are the important support system (Cox and Cox 1979).Expressed emotion has emerged as an important variable in studies of family and psychopathology. It is regarded as a measure of environmental stress in the home. Perceived criticism negatively correlates with emotional intelligence. People who perceived their families to be critical of them also perceive their family to be less close, less adaptable and perceive themselves to have less social support. Perceived criticism positively correlates with income, education of the parents. Respondent who perceived their family's intensely emotionally involved reported more social support and higher cohesion and adaptability. Perceived criticism had a higher correlation with depression and anxiety. This findings support the view that Expressed emotion may be related to a range of psychological problems.Need & importance of the studyVarious factors contribute to mental health problems. Studies reviewed showed that some demographic variables such as gender, parental occupational levels and family income had an influence on mental health and emotional well-being of adolescent. Research evidence showed few dimensions of emotional intelligence, perceived family environment and low pro-social behavior contributed to mental health problems of adolescents.OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDYTo analyze the influence of demographic variables on emotional intelligence and perceived family environment.To analyze the relationship between emotional intelligence, perceived family environment and mental health problems and pro-social behavior in adolescence.METHODThe design adopted was expost facto and primarily descriptive in nature.Variables in the study were as follows:Independent variables - Demographic variables - gender, parental education, occupation, family income, emotional intelligence, perceived family environment.Dependent variables - Mental health problems, pro-social behavior.SampleSample was selected from three aided schools in semi urban areas. One was girls' school and the other two were co-educational schools. All the students from the IX standard who were present in these schools on the day of testing which totaled 761 students were included for the study. …",

To prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary antipsychotic use, it is important to rule out other causes of visual hallucinations. The mnemonic VISUALS reminds us of common causes. Visions that are culturally sanctioned occur in non-Western societies--eg, images of fairy-like spirits are accepted and reinforced as part of the Filipino culture--and in several Christian denominations in the United States. Positive cultural connotations may increase the frequency of visual hallucinations as well as produce varied attitudes and emotional reactions to them.' Imaginary friends often fulfill a child's need for a relationship, although even social children may have these Children often refer to imaginary friends in conversations and play with them. Usually they are also children. They may be extensions of people the child admires or be named after characters from stories, movies, or television. Children rarely are able to explain the imaginary friend's appearance and more than half the time there is no trigger for the appearance of such friends.

Typical visual hallucinations may include monsters, bugs, pets, or toys.

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (ecstasy), marijuana, nitrous oxide, and mescaline often cause visual hallucinations, although these substances may not be identified in a routine urine toxicology Other considerations are withdrawal from benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, or alcohol, and rare adverse reactions to antidepressants, antibiotics, or anticonvuLsants. …",

Convergent evidence suggests that there may be a specific pattern of neurobiologic dysfunction in this subgroup of patients accounting for symptom co-expression. This review indicates that future studies should distinguish among (1) apparent obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) that occur only in the context of psychosis and that may overlap with psychotic phenomenology, representing a forme fruste of psychosis; (2) OCS occurring only in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia; (3) neuroleptic-induced OCS or OCD; and (4) OCS or frank OCD occurring concurrently with schizophrenia. We examine the evidence for a putative schizo-obsessive disorder and outline suggestions for identifying OCS in the presence of psychosis.",

      "abstract": "The notion that subtle cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and functional deviations from norms are present in many individuals several years before a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia has been around for almost a century. This notion has been at the base of the developmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and has been the impetus for the use of cognition as an endophenotype for studying the illness. The recent enthusiasm for prodromal research derives from two unrelated and controversial claims: that short duration of untreated psychosis is associated with better prognosis and that novel antipsychotic drugs have a better safety profile, supposedly enabling early intervention at a relatively lower risk of side effects to the patient. At the current level of knowledge, the risk-benefit assessment of prodromal interventions turns out to be an almost unsolvable conundrum. On one hand, the age of onset of psychosis and schizophrenia, early and mid-ado-lescence, coincides with the age at which life-long social and vocational characteristics are shaped. Any intervention that could produce even minimal delay in onset of active psychosis or ameliorate its early course might have a life-long impact. Therefore, the idea of prodromal intervention cannot be easily dismissed. On the other hand, in absence of accurate markers for imminent psychosis and strong data indicating that treatment during the prodromal phase is effective, exposing adolescents to the stigma associated with the illness and the adverse effects of antipsychotics has raised serious hesitations among many researchers and clinicians.",

      "abstract": "Considering the lack of clarity in the conceptualisation of hypochondriasis, it is not surprising that the concept is quite heterogeneous and that there are dilemmas in terms of what is encompassed by hypochondriasis and where its boundaries are. Therefore, the aim of this review paper was to contribute towards a more coherent view on hypochondriasis, which would also allow its more adequate classification. The essential features of hypochondriasis were identified as an overvalued idea about the presence of disease, fear that the person has already become seriously ill, reassurance-seeking and other forms of health checking, and disturbances in the perception of bodily sensations and symptoms. These four aspects of hypochondriasis can be assessed dimensionally to ascertain to what extent they characterise each patient. Suggestions have been made to delineate more precisely hypochondriasis from health anxiety, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other somatoform disorders, personality disorders, depression, and delusional disorder with disease-related delusions. In the absence of better alternatives, hypochondriasis should continue to be classified among the somatoform disorders. In order to improve communication between clinicians and reduce conceptual heterogeneity, the term 'hypochondriasis' should be used to refer only to primary hypochondriasis. The pressure to abandon this term should be resisted until an adequate substitution for it has been found.",

      "abstract": "Micropsia may accompany neurological defect or dysfunction as in tumors of the temporal lobe and petit mal. It may be encountered as a psychopathological phenomenon without structural defect. It is described relatively infrequently in medical literature. The symptom involves seeing objects or people as very small, off in the distance, as if one were looking \"through the wrong end of a telescope.\"An impression of objects moving away, into the distance, is often described. A patient in psychiatric treatment told of a series of such episodes during his childhood. His micropsia apparently reflected his expansive needs counteracting a closed-in feeling, his reaction to heavy psychological pressures, an attempt to cope with intense repressed anger, a way of symbolically manipulating people identified as objects, and a method of exercising control to cope with feelings of weakness and insecurity. The micropsia was a mirror of his feeling of separation from people and things about him during those childhood years, and it serves as an indication of his loneliness. It was a sign of diminishing ego strength, but was not followed by a psychotic break. Defenses were evidently reinforced later, judging by the patient's history and the personality patterns that evolved. The oral and aggressive components in this case were witnessed by others in studies of their patients. Pertinent references are mentioned here, and the observations integrated with my own findings. Similarities and differences in the cases are noted. Finally, mention is made briefly of another patient of mine with micropsia although there was no opportunity to evaluate the psychodynamics of his problem.",

For a few people, mental disorders or complications in the grieving process ensue. We summarise research on risk factors that increase vulnerability of some bereaved individuals. Diverse factors (circumstances of death, intrapersonal and interpersonal variables, ways of coping) are likely to co-determine excesses in ill-health.

Her past history was marked by long-standing dysthymia, a propensity to somatization, drug overdoses and antisocial behaviour, including the killing of her grandson. She had suffered substantial deprivation and abuse from her earliest years. She was considered unsuitable for dynamic psychotherapy because of her personality organization, her use of primitive defence mechanisms and her inability to tolerate frustration, given her propensity to act out in destructive ways towards herself and others. She was managed within a multidisciplinary team in an old age day hospital. This patient illustrates that personality dysfunction does not necessarily ameliorate with advancing age. Less overt manifestations of destructive behaviour, such as sabotage of treatment, starvation and polypharmacy, may be seen in this age group.",

Reduplicative paramnesia (RP) is a specific phenomenon characterized by subjective certainty that a familiar place or person has been duplicated. Clinical evidences indicated that the patient with RP following right prefrontal damages showed the lack of emotional valence for the present hospital. This abnormal sense of familiarity triggered the deficits of the orientation of self to the outside world, that is, double orientation, resulting in the development of geographical reduplicative paramnesia. In line with the pathogenesis of CD and RP after brain damages, the delusion in schizophrenia may have a germ as developmental origins, which include the aberrant or salient perceptual experiences and abnormal sense of agency, and might be further aggravated by the impairment of causal reasoning process such as the jumping-to-conclusions bias.",

      "abstract": "Patients communicating psychological distress in the form of somatic symptoms and seeking medical care for them pose difficult diagnostic and treatment dilemmas for the primary care physician. Somatization may be conceptualized as an illness-focused behavior style, with multiple etiologies, rather than a single psychiatric disorder. Somatizing behavior is associated with emotional distress, cognitive-perceptual abnormalities, and socially learned illness behaviors. Although recognition of the somatizing patient begins with thorough medical evaluation, assessment should also include careful examination of social history and the affective meaning of symptoms. Management strategies will vary according to the etiology of the psychiatric diagnosis associated with physical symptoms; however, the essential element is provision of a long-term supportive relationship with a physician, who provides effective monitoring of physical and mental health status, appropriate emotional support, and reassurance concerning symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Pyridoxine-dependent seizure (PDS) is a readily treatable cause of intractable seizures in childhood (1). Not more than 100 cases have been reported in the English language indexed journals. Delay in initiation of treatment could result in permanent mental handicap. It is generally recommended that a trial of pyridoxine should be given in all cases of intractable seizures below the age of 3 years (2). We report a case of 4-year-old boy with mental retardation and intractable seizures who, responded well to pyridoxine. This report emphasizes the importance of considering PDS in children with intractable seizures beyond 3 years. A 4-year-old boy was admitted to the pediatrics intensive care unit with status epilepticus. He was born to non-consanguineous parents with an Apgar score of 10 at 5 minutes. There was no family history of seizures or mental impairment. Child attained social smile at 4 months, turned over at 7 months, walked independently at 20 months, and started saying 2-3 words at 3 years. Generalized seizures (partial seizures with generalization and myoclonus) started at the age 2 years. Various antiepileptic drugs either as monotherapy or in combination resulted mild reduction in seizure frequency. At 4 years he could speak 3-4 words, could indicate toilet needs and walk with minimal difficulty. His vision and hearing were normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed multifocal spike and wave discharges. MRI of brain showed mild diffuse cerebral atrophy with prominent ventricles. The following tests were normal or negative: hemogram, serum calcium and phosphorous, blood thyroid hormone profile, renal and liver function tests, serum ammonia, blood arterial pH, plasma organic acids, and urine homocysteine, reducing substances and organic acids.

For example, studies of epilepsy and psychiatric disorders have been largely based on special referral populations and have not used control groups. Children with attentional disorders, however, usually can be alerted, although not necessarily immediately, when spoken to or shaken. Psychiatric disturbances occur as interictal epileptic phenomena, but the specific relationships between epilepsy and these disorders remain controversial. The majority of studies have focused on the relationship of epilepsy to the psychoses, personality disorders, and organic mental disorders. Twenty-five percent of patients were found to have \"neuroses\" in Gudmundsson's population-based Icelandic study, however, patients with other chronic neurologic conditions have similarly high rates of personality disorders, anxiety states, and other minor syndromes. Patients with epilepsy are at increased risk for depression, probably largely due to psychosocial pressures.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia occurs in 1% of the world's population, regardless of country and culture. The prevalence of very early-onset schizophrenia (below age 13) is about 2 in a million children in the general population. In adolescence, the prevalence increases and the symptomatology becomes similar to disorders in adults. The clinical presentation comprises cognitive symptoms (distortions of thinking, delusions, hallucinations), emotional symptoms (e.g. blunted affect, mood disturbances, irritability), disturbances of speech and language as well as motor disturbances (motor disharmony, stupor or catatonia). The concept of positive and negative symptoms can also be applied to schizophrenic disorders of this age group. Diagnosis is made according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria, but is more difficult than in adults. At an early age, false-positive diagnoses are frequent. Etiological factors comprise a genetic background, structural abnormalities of the brain, neurodevelopmental anomalies, electrophysiological dysfunctions, biochemical irregularities, and neurocognitive dysfunctions. An interaction of these factors with environmental influences such as distorted communication in the family and trauma is assumed. The etiological concept of the stress-vulnerability hypothesis has been complemented by the neurodevelopmental and the neurodegeneration hypothesis. Treatment is based on four components: antipsychotic medication, psychotherapeutic measures, family-oriented measures, and specific measures of rehabilitation for those patients whose disorder is likely to become chronic. Course and outcome of childhood and adolescentonset schizophrenia are poor and much worse than in adult patients.",

Although maladjustment and pathology are not the most common styles of making the transition from childhood to adulthood, they do occur with increasing frequency. Four major problems of adolescence are: (1) schizophrenia, (2) depression and suicidal behavior, (3) anorexia nervosa, and (4) substance abuse. Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disturbance characterized by impaired intellectual functioning, disturbed affect, and impaired social interaction. Behavioral signs of schizophrenia may appear in childhood or early adolescence, prior to onset of the disorder. Approximately one-third to one-half of preschizophrenic adolescents is identifiable as deviant during childhood. Depression is a relatively rare diagnosis among adolescents, although it may be a common psychological experience. Adolescent depressives are less likely than their adult counterparts to admit their strong feelings of worthlessness, and more likely to act out their depression. Anorexia nervosa is a serious eating disorder that primarily affects adolescent girls. Anorexics may literally starve themselves to death, although they are often preoccupied with food-related thoughts.",

      "abstract": "Depression is often accompanied by a wide variety of somatic symptoms even when there is no evidence of any organic disorder that can cause such symptoms. Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAccording to Turcin1, none of the factors that encourage the criminal acts is as undeniable and obvious as alcohol. Nevertheless, there are numerous attempts of searching for something that could be classified as or prealcoholic personality.25 Some authors indicate neuroticism, weak ego, addiction and change in stimuli intensity as significant characteristics of the alcoholic personality. There is numerous evidence of weak ego in alcoholics.612Erikson1316 describes an alcoholic as an individual whose life course is defined by a negative ego-identity, which reduces and destroys his abilities. Thus, everything that makes the ego stronger contributes to the strengthening of an individual's ego-identity.Nenadic Sviglin10 states that the alcoholics who began drinking before the age of twenty, and exhibited the antisocial behaviour, showed the highest level of hostile feelings among groups. The psychosocial maturity in latent phase was lower in the group of alcoholics with antisocial behaviour, who began drinking before the age of twenty, than in the following two groups: alcoholics without antisocial behaviour and alcoholics with antisocial behaviour who began drinking after the age of twenty.11Kozaric Kovacic9 states that the group of aggressive alcoholics showed a significantly lower psychosocial maturity in the latent phase, in contrast to the non-aggressive alcoholics, which indicates the ego development blocking in this phase. A study by the same author showed that delinquent alcoholics exhibited a weaker ego in the latent phase with a significantly higher level of outward hostility than the non-delinquent alcoholics.The aim of the studyTo determine the psychodynamic characteristics of ego and Psychopathologie characteristics of alcoholic personality in respect to the type of criminal offence.The hypothesis of the studyAlcoholic offenders committing homicide have weaker egos and present more hostile, depressive and anxious personality characteristics.Sample and method of the studyThe study was conducted within the penal system, in the penitentiary in Lipovica and at the Dr Ivan Barbot Neuropsychiatrie Hospital in Popovaca. The study included two groups of subjects.The experimental group (E) (N=96) was comprised of individuals with prison sentences for homicide (N 1=32), traffic offences (N2=32) and property offences (N3=32). The experimental group was comprised of subjects who had been diagnosed with alcohol dependence during the expert evaluation and were being treated for alcoholism during their incarceration. The subjects had been drinking for at least five years and the clinical assessment of alcohol addiction met the diagnostic conditions according to MKB-IO and DSM-IV criteria.The control group (K) (N4=64) was comprised of alcoholics who were being treated for alcoholism at the Department for alcohol abuse at the Dr Ivan Barbot Neuropsychiatrie Hospital in Popovaca; they, too, met the diagnostic conditions. We excluded the alcoholics suffering from severe physical illnesses, those that had used drugs or other psychotropic substances during the last year prior to the study, those with obvious organic disorders, those suffering from schizophrenia or affective disorders not related to alcohol, those with antisocial personality disorders before the presentation of alcoholism, and those with high primary intellectual dysfunctions. Schizophrenia, mania, depression and antisocial personality disorders were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria.18 The study was carried out between the fifth and the tenth day after the admission.The following measuring instruments were applied for each subject:1. A structured questionnaire for general data;2. A structured questionnaire for the alcohol abuse history;3. An ego identity scale according to Erikson1315 for estimation of fixation and regression, to determine the six levels of psychosocial maturity. …",

It is a perceptual state: the glass is always half-empty rather than half full. One sees only the dark side of things. It is tied to daily activities; it sabotages motivation and saps energy. It affects the most basic elements of life, causing insomnia, loss of appetite, and sexual dysfunction. Sometimes it’s linked to obsessive worry and rumination, always anticipating and expecting the worst to happen. We all encounter things in life that eat at our souls. Who would not be depressed when a loved one dies or illness strikes the family? If you have Parkinson’s disease (PD), the prospect of a chronic disease is discouraging in and of itself. If you have had to restrict your lifestyle because of PD, that is all the more reason to become discouraged. Hence depression is a part of the normal human existence and is appropriate during times when things are going very badly. Depression becomes pathological when it is prolonged, severe, or out of proportion to events. Although depression may be triggered by major life trauma, it sometimes comes out of nowhere.",

      "abstract": "Sexual problems that are psychological in origin, rather than physiological, are called psychosexual disorders. Multiple factors, such as general health of the patient, chronic illnesses, psychiatric/psychological disorders, and socio-cultural factors, alone or in combination can be attributed to the development of psychosexual dysfunctions. The symptoms of these disorders vary for each individual and differ with gender. These disorders may be categorized as sexual dysfunction, paraphilias, and gender identity disorders. Dermatologists are sometimes consulted for sexual dysfunctions in their routine practice by the patients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics because a majority of the patients believe that these problems are caused by dysfunctions in the sex organs, and because people are hesitant to go to sexuality clinics and psychiatrists for such problems. Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them. Dermatologists should understand basic sexual medicine and ask patients for sexual problems. They should be trained to manage such patients accordingly. In this review, we will be focusing on sexual dysfunctions, their etiopathogenesis, and management from a dermatologist's perspective.",

      "title": "The Boundaries of Madness: Seeking to Understand the Experiences of Those Who Receive a Personality Disorder Diagnosis, or ‘Tales from the Borderlands’",
      "abstract": "Experiences traditionally associated with madness, or psychosis, for example hearing voices or delusional belief, are increasingly being recognised within healthy populations. Such findings raise the possibility of madness existing on a continuum with other mental states. However, this is not in keeping with the application of classic diagnostic systems, commonly used by mental health services, which utilise categorical descriptions, including symptom lists, and a normative component in terms of impact on the individual's capacity to maintain social roles. Such systems are atheoretical and risk stripping experiences of its phenomenological impact. In contrast, recent clinical guidance, such as Understanding Psychosis and Schizophrenia from the British Psychological Society, emphasises the importance of individual meaning in relation to experience and the pertinence of this in relation to working with individuals seeking clinical support. In distinction to diagnoses such as Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder, often referred to as major mental illness, the experiences of individuals in receipt of a personality disorder diagnosis sit more clearly at the frontier between madness and normality. Indeed the commonest such diagnosis, borderline personality disorder, was so named in recognition of its straddling the psychoanalytic divide between psychosis and neurosis. The experiences of individuals with personality disorder diagnoses may therefore offer a window and framework through which the division between sanity and madness can be viewed. To explore this phenomena in more detail a research study, underway at the University of Manchester, seeks to capture the lived experience of people with a personality disorder diagnosis; including the manner in which they make sense of their personal experience and seek help in relation to distress. Through the use of narrative interviews this study seeks to make sense of the conceptual space existing in the borderlands around madness; and so inform the manner in which mental distress can be understood.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Symptoms &amp; Misdiagnosis Of Frontotemporal Dementia: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common type of dementia seen between 45-65 years of age and affects the frontal and/or temporal lobes. FTD is clinically characterized by progressively the change in behavior, personality, and language dysfunctions. Clinical features of FTD include restlessness, disinhibition, apathy, blunted affect, avolition, social withdrawal, impulsiveness, and loss of executive function. Most patients with FTD act as socially inappropriate behaviors, not talking much, compulsive-like acts, poor insight, and psychiatric features including hallucinations and paranoid delusions. According to symptoms, the diagnosis of FTD may be confused with depression, mania, or schizophrenia. Objectives In this case report, we wanted to draw attention that FTD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of late-onset psychosis. Methods A 53-year-old female, married, uneducated, and not having children patient has applied to our clinic with complaints, that started a year ago, about social withdrawal, activity, decreased sense of purpose, neglecting personal hygiene, not eating well, and acting inappropriately and impulsively. The patient reported that she was walking out of the house for hours, having profanity speeches, and forgetfulness. She was admitted to the psychiatry hospital a year ago and discharged with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Brain MRI showed atrophy of frontal and anterior temporal structures bilaterally. PET scan demonstrated left frontal, parietal, and temporal hypo perfusion of the brain. In our clinical observation, she had apathy, inappropriate jokes, lack of eye contact, flat affect, lack of gesturing when communicating, unable to respond to questions, and visual hallucinations. Results Due to the similarity of the clinical resemblance of BPAD and FTD, the diagnosis of FTD can be confusing. In this case, amnesia and sudden onset of the symptoms with rapid destruction may help the diagnosis of FTD. Psychosis symptoms in our clinical observation also suggested the diagnosis of psychosis. However, its atypical course and early-onset psychosis symptoms brought us closer to organic pathology. Investigations of structural and functional brain imaging may help support the diagnosis. Image: Image 2: Conclusions Psychiatric symptoms in FTD may cause misdiagnosis. Organic pathologies should be kept in mind, especially in late and sudden onset symptoms.

Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

      "title": "Insomnia heterogeneity: Characteristics to consider for data-driven multivariate subtyping",
      "abstract": "Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have reported surprisingly few consistent insomnia-characteristics with respect to cognitions, mood, traits, history of life events and family history. One interpretation of this limited consistency is that different subtypes of insomnia exist, each with its own specific multivariate profile of characteristics. Because previously unrecognized subtypes will be differentially represented in individual studies and dilute effect sizes of subtype-dependent characteristics of importance, they are unlikely to be reported consistently in individual studies, let alone in meta-analyses. This review therefore aims to complement meta-analyses by listing previously reported psychometric characteristics of insomnia, irrespective of the degree of consistency over studies. The review clearly indicates that characteristics of insomnia may not be limited to sleep. Reports suggest that at least some individuals with insomnia may deviate from people without sleep complaints with respect to demographics, mental and physical health, childhood trauma, life events, fatigue, sleepiness, hyperarousal, hyperactivity, other sleep disorders, lifetime sleep history, chronotype, depression, anxiety, mood, quality of life, personality, happiness, worry, rumination, self-consciousness, sensitivity, dysfunctional beliefs, self-conscious emotion regulation, coping, nocturnal mentation, wake resting-state mentation, physical activity, food intake, temperature perception and hedonic evaluation. The value of this list of characteristics is that 1) internet has now made it feasible to asses them all in a large sample of people suffering from insomnia, and 2) statistical methods like latent class analysis and community detection can utilize them for a truly bottom-up data-driven search for subtypes. The supplement to this review provides a blueprint of this multivariate approach as implemented in the Sleep registry platform (www.sleepregistry.nl), that allows for bottom-up subtyping and fosters cross-cultural comparison and worldwide collaboration on insomnia subtype finding - and beyond.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "title": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder",
      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurobehavioral disorder in childhood. The major components of this disorder are developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, which result in functional impairment in 1 or more areas of academic, social, and emotional function. In addition to the propensity for children to have some compromise of academic and emotional function, children with ADHD also have a higher frequency of co-occurring learning, cognitive, language, motor, and mental health disorders. Similarly, children with developmental disorders have a higher risk of co-occurring ADHD. The diagnosis of ADHD can be ascertained by a review of the risks for the condition, consideration of masquerading conditions, a careful history and physical examination, and the recognition of co-occurring disorders. The signs and symptoms of co-occurring disorders and the management of ADHD differ across early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence. Management is largely limited to behavioral and pharmacologic interventions, and it favors behavioral strategies in early childhood, pharmacologic and behavioral strategies in middle childhood, and pharmacologic interventions in adolescence. This article offers an approach to the evaluation, presentation, and management of ADHD with a focus on guiding primary care pediatricians.",

      "abstract": "The sensitive delusion of reference has been coined by Kretschmer in 1919. This delusion reaction comports three levels: the sensitive character that is defined as shy, hyperemotives and sensitives subjects that are marked by a high sense of moral values, pride, a relational hyperesthesia resulting a high vulnerability in social contacts, and a tendency to self-criticism to internalize painfully failures and susceptibility. A traumatic event that reveals the subject its own failure and who humiliates him on the plan ethics. It follows then the delusion of reference itself with: depressive remorse with hypochondriac fears and thoughts of persecution on conversations of a great banality of everyday life. It settled in adults (usually after 35 years), 'old singles', or 'young masturbators'. It is generally complicated with severe depressive episodes. Evolution is less often chronic than in the other paranoias, however, even after a favorable development, the signs are likely to reappear on the occasion of a new disappointment. The French Psychiatry school individualizes this syndrome within non-dissociative chronic delusions, among the paranoid delusions, hallucinatory chronic psychosis and paraphrenia. In DSM-IV, the sensitive delusion of reference is classified under delusional disorder category with all not dissociative chronic delusions. In the current conceptual reduction, we illustrate this fine entity by two clinical vignettes.",

We used the Thought Disorder Index to examine whether schizophrenic patients in whom psychotic symptoms appear in adolescence show the same characteristic features of thought disorder as do adult schizophrenics. Quantitative and qualitative features of thought disorder were assessed in psychiatric inpatients with adolescent-onset schizophrenia, psychotic depression, and nonpsychotic conditions compared with normal control adolescents. Elevated thought disorder occurred in all groups of adolescents hospitalized for an acute episode of psychiatric illness. The magnitude of the elevation and the frequency of occurrence of disordered thinking were greatest in the psychotic adolescents. The qualitative features of the thought disturbances found in the schizophrenic adolescents were distinct from those observed in adolescents with psychotic depression. The thinking of the schizophrenic adolescents resembled that of adult schizophrenics. In both conditions thought disorder is characterized by idiosyncratic word usage, illogical reasoning, perceptual confusion, loss of realistic attunement to the task, and loosely related ideas.",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

Primary separation of the symphysis articulation occurs, permitting the head to occupy a position low in the pelvis.\n\n9.

It can be diagnosed in three different conditions: when there is inattention, but insufficient hyperactivity and impulsiveness to meet full criteria for ADHD-combined type; when there is inattention and no hyperactivity or impulsivity; or when previously diagnosed individuals with ADHD-C have lost the hyperactivity component. Another potential subtype is the so called sluggish cognitive tempo, which entails slower processing speed rather than overt distractibility and inattentiveness. The associated conditions profile tends to be different than the ADHD-C type, but there still is risk for anxiety, depression and learning disabilities. In addition to medication, other modalities should be explored, including accommodations in the classroom (504 plan), social skills training, cognitive behavior therapy, and sometimes occupational therapy.",

A trait deficiency in serotonin input to the anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex is found in association with suicide, and more recently non-fatal suicidal behaviour, and is linked to decision-making and suicide intent by imaging and related studies in vivo. The same neural circuitry and serotonin deficiency may contribute to impulsive aggressive traits that are part of the diathesis for suicidal behaviour and are associated with early onset mood disorders and greater risk for suicidal behaviour. Other brain areas manifest deficient serotonin input, that is, a trait related to recurrent major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Thus the serotonin system is involved in both the diathesis for suicidal behaviour in terms of decision-making, and to a major stressor, namely episodes of major depression.",

      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder.

Prevalence in the general population is estimated at 1.1–2.5% and varies in clinical populations depending on the setting, from 10% of the outpatients up to 20–50% of inpatients. The comorbidity in this group of patients is high and diverse. The majority of BPD patients have experienced sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse, and emotional neglect in their childhood; sexual abuse in particular between the ages of 6 and 12. These traumatic experiences in combination with temperament, insecure attachment, developmental stage of the child, as well as the social situation in which things took place, result in the development of dysfunctional interpretations of the patient's self and others.Treating BPD patients with schema therapy makes it relatively easy to comprehend the patient's dysfunctional behavior and it gives the therapist many tools to treat the patient.",

This study examined the headachehistories of teenage headache patients, the majority of whom were found to be depressed, and found that personal loss occurred within 12 months of headache onset in 11 of 15 cases. Among the losses that were identified were those involving terminal illness and death of family members, separation and/or divorce in the family, or change of residence from a familiar area. It is recommended that opportunities for dealing with feelings about their losses should be presented to patients, whether or not the patients express a need for this. Furthermore, it is recommended that patients of any age who cannot identify a triggering event prior to the onset of their headache histories should be questioned in detail about the possible correlation with personal loss.",

Sign language dynamics or language dysfluency may be falsely recognized as disorganized thinking. Some of the symptoms indicating disorganized thinking in the case of spoken languages may fulfill specific functions when used in sign language (for example object chaining). Furthermore, deaf individuals experience multiple stressors that may be considered as risk factors for developing delusions, especially for those growing up in hearing, non-signing families. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that some seemingly delusional beliefs shared by prelingually deaf people may be associated with the lack of assisted learning, gullibility, low level of confidence in healthcare or deaf communities' social norms. The question concerning the sensory modality of hallucinations experienced by deaf individuals remains unresolved. Patients' accounts suggest that hallucinations described as auditory may be perceived as lip-reading without identifying the speaker's face, among others. However, for those who provide help it is far more important to recognize the function of hallucinations and to differentiate them from normative experience.It is essential to expand our knowledge regarding the clinical presentation of psychotic disorders in deaf individuals in order to develop assessment guidelines and tools and, above all, increase the well-being of those suffering from psychotic disorders, as well as of those whose diagnosis remains unclear.",

Functional disability due to disease attracts little medical interest, which is concentrated upon the specific features of the disease; thus the referral letter about a younger patient with suspected myocardial infarction is likely to discuss the features of the chest pain, but is unlikely to mention whether the patient can walk to the toilet or feed himself.",

      "abstract": "Psychological trauma occurs when a person suffers from serious threat or loss to his/her life. Childhood psychological trauma can be of various forms such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect. Such adverse childhood experiences, if not effectively dealt or resolved, may lead to the development of drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS) in adult life. In many cases, development of ADS is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Such a person with a history of childhood psychological traumas may consume alcohol to cope with his/her trauma-related distress. Alexithymia is a state characterized by a triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in differentiating between physical sensations and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others. Alexithymia has a role in the development of drug dependence including ADS. The number of childhood psychological trauma among persons with ADS was associated with alexithymia in adulthood. Childhood psychological traumas, mainly emotional abuse, might act as a predisposing factor for the development of alexithymia in persons suffering from ADS. This case series presented clinical picture of two individuals with ADS in which both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia were assessed by using standard and psychometrically valid psychological tools such as Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 item, respectively. This case series is unique because the assessment of childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia is neglected area in Indian psychiatric research field and detailed ample of literature is not available at present in which the relationship between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS has been assessed. In the present case series, first individual with ADS had clinically significant alexithymia, severe emotional abuse, severe emotional neglect, moderate physical abuse, and moderate physical neglect, while second individual with ADS had no alexithymia but he had moderate-level emotional neglect and mild levels of emotional abuse, physical abuse, and physical neglect.",

Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although several theoretical positions deal with the concept of childhood depression, accurate measurement of depression can only occur if valid and reliable measures are available. Current efforts emphasize direct questioning of the child and quantification of parents' observations. One scale used to study childhood depression, the Personality Inventory for Children (PIC), correlates with many of the characteristics associated with childhood depression. A cluster analysis of 1,800 PIC profiles has revealed 13 replicated patterns or profile types. The PIC Depression scale enters into the identification of three of these types. The first, Type 3 Profile, suggests a child or adolescent with chronic cognit4ve deficits and academic failure who has difficulty adjusting to change. For these children the Depression scale reflects the effect of social incompetence. The Type 7 Profile represents a combination of depression and externalization symptomatology. These children are often angry or insecure, have poor relations with their parents, and often come from disrupted, chaotic families. Type 9 Profile children are likely to be referred for help due to an observed disturbance of mood and/or somatic complaints. These children feel competitive or angry with siblings and depend on parents who are often viewed as clinically depressed and in need of individual treatment.

      "abstract": "One adult subgroup of the schizophrenic syndrome seems to share minimal brain dysfunction (MBD) as Anlage, mostly but not exclusively on a familial basis and occurring in varying degrees. Pathogenically, MBD usually involves problems of spatial orientation, the development of language, and a low external and internal stimulus barrier. These cortical problems can lead to problems of establishing self-boundaries and coordination, to feelings of perplexity, difficulties with the written and spoken word and abstract conceptualization, poor impulse control and defenses, overload by external stimuli, and resulting disorganization. These phenomena in turn cause secondary emotional problems, especially during the school years. In addition to neuropsychological and soft neurological signs and symptoms, this group is diagnostically characterized by a poor response to phenothiazines alone. Therapeutically, energizers, together with diphenylhydantoin, at times in combination with lithium, are often useful. Psychotherapy must include education concerning MBD and must deal with the primary and secondary cognitive and emotional aspects of MBD as well as other problems. Prevention of overload and genetic counseling may be indicated.",

Much of the interest in behavioral supersensitivity has come about because of tardive dyskinesia and other extrapyramidal side effects related to the use of neuroleptic drugs administered chronically to schizophrenics. These drugs are also used very widely with retarded persons for behavior control of severe disorders like SIB or aggression. There is a statistically significant effect of drug withdrawal on SIB, but not other behaviors. Researchers have developed interest in the physiological components of SIB since the description of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome in 1964. It has been used successfully sometimes when punishment has failed, for instance, with self-biting among Lesch-Nyhan syndrome patients or as non-contingent social isolation for self-hitting.",

      "title": "Biology of Memory and Childhood Trauma",
      "abstract": "Examples have been presented of children's behaviors that demonstrate the trauma-learning pattern of re-enactment, repetition, and displacement. They become persistent parts of the symptom complex of PTSD. The encapsulation phase occurs when the trauma event occurs and symptoms present themselves, but the events as yet are undisclosed. The trauma-specific behavior patterns, the general hyper-arousal symptoms, and the avoidant, numbing symptoms persist; the emerging disruptive behaviors are not linked to the traumatic event and reactions to the trauma. The response of the child's social and interpersonal context to the internalizing or externalizing behaviors post-trauma, continue shaping the internal cognitive schema of the child. When the child is unable to link ongoing, self-defeating, disruptive behavior to trauma experience, the underlying fear persists. This interferes with the child's ability to modulate emotions either through altering the persistence of refractory, self-limiting cognitive schema or the inability to use new experience to develop and grow. The flexibility of children to discriminate new information may be lost; the children are either numb to new information or hyperalert and perceive danger. Issues for treatment include children's distress over memories of the trauma and the lack of capacity to learn and develop from new interpersonal experiences. It has been our experience that nurses first must help the child relearn flexibility through self-observation, the element of self-soothing and calming behaviors, processing of new information, and strengthening of social relationships. With new and strengthened personal resources, the child then is able to begin to process the traumatic memories.",

FTD most often presents with either a change in personality or behavior, such as social withdrawal, increased gregariousness, disinhibition, or obsessive behaviors; or with impairment of language function. Memory difficulties are common, but usually are less prominent than these other symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Frequently, psychiatric diagnoses are initially the primary consideration. Cases may be either familial or sporadic. In this familial case, an autopsy was ultimately performed and revealed findings characteristic of FTD, with grossly evident focal brain degeneration in the frontal and temporal regions, microscopic signs of gliosis, and cellular abnormalities of the intracellular microtubule-associated protein tau.",

      "title": "Cognitive functions and social cognition in multiple sclerosis: An overview.",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline has been widely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) despite its clinical heterogeneity, at all stages and in all subtypes of the disease. Deficits are most commonly present in attention, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency and executive function. However, MS patients also show decreased performance in tasks related to social cognition, i.e. mental operations thatdrive interpersonal skills such as social perception, empathy and theory of mind. Social cognitive deficits are an underestimated but important aspect of impairment in MS, reflecting how people process, store, and apply information in social interactions. Deficits in these domains have been associated with reduced social and psychological quality of life, even after controlling for severity and duration of the disease, age, and neurocognitive performance. Social cognition impairment is not entirely dependent on and parallel to general cognitive dysfunction, given that some patients experience disorganization of their social life before a significant or detectable cognitive impairment. The decrease in performance of social cognition tasks may reflect changes in brain activity and brain structure, either general or regional. Both subtle diffuse pathology and acute local lesions have at least partially independent effects on aspects of social cognition. The observed white matter damage contributes to a mechanism of disruption in the network of brain connections involved in social cognition. Undoubtedly, there is a wide variability in the relationship of social cognitionand neuroanatomical findings, not only due to the brain's complex connectivity, but also to the lack of a unique operative definition of these cognitive domains. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare study results, given the variability of clinical presentations in all stages of the disease.More research would contribute in understanding social cognition deficits better and in determining whether and what kind of training could be beneficial.",

      "title": "The Nature of Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter discusses the nature of panic disorder (PD) and agoraphobia. The hallmark symptom of PD is a history of unexpected panic attacks that are experienced by the patient as occurring from out of the blue, without any obvious trigger or cue. However, some patients may be quite adept at predicting their panic attacks, and upon initial screening may even deny having unexpected panic attacks. Therapists should inquire carefully into the patient’s experiences of initial panic attacks to determine whether there is an early history of unexpected panic attacks. Meanwhile, according to DSM-5, and in a change from DSM-IV, agoraphobia is diagnosed separately from PD, though it can co-occur with PD if criteria are met for both. Agoraphobia is characterized by intense fear or anxiety about going into certain places or situations in which individuals might have panic-like or other embarrassing symptoms, especially in contexts where escape might be difficult or help unavailable. In severe cases, individuals with agoraphobia will not leave their homes, may avoid work, and (very rarely) may confine themselves to a single room in their home due to an intense fear of experiencing panic attacks or other symptoms. The chapter then looks at the psychobiological conceptualization of PD, before considering the development of agoraphobia. It also assesses nocturnal panic.",

      "title": "Hallucinations and Delusions",
      "abstract": "Defining terms is an appropriate introduction to this chapter. Hallucinations imply seeing things that are not truly present, or hearing illusory voices or music. In DLB and PDD, hallucinations are nearly always visual and manifest as seeing nonexistent people or objects, such as strangers in the house or yard. The affected individual may realize that he or she is experiencing a hallucination, but some people may not recognize that these are not real. In other disorders auditory hallucinations may be present, such as hearing voices. However, such auditory hallucinations are rare in Lewy disorders. Delusions are defined as false, often irrational beliefs. Frequently, these will have a theme, such as the conviction that someone is spying, or paranoia about friends or neighbors. A common theme is spousal infidelity, sometimes nonsensical, such as an older adult’s accusations of their mate starting an extramarital affair after 50 years of marriage. Capgras syndrome is an uncommon but striking example of delusional thinking in which the spouse or other immediate family member is accused of being an impostor. Hallucinations or delusions may occur in Parkinson’s disease in the absence of frank dementia. However, dementia is the usual setting for these problems. Hallucinations are much more common than delusions. Sometimes they are very limited, perhaps only present at night. Hallucinations are a contraindication to driving a motor vehicle, for obvious reasons. The fundamental cause of hallucinations and delusions in DLB and PDD is the Lewy neurodegenerative process. The precise region of the brain that is responsible is not known, however. These often occur in the absence of any external provocative factors. However, medications are notorious for inciting such problems in susceptible people. Chapter 7 focused on simplifying medications especially for this reason. Drugs for parkinsonism are well-known culprits, in particular two classes: (1) the dopamine agonists: pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and rotigotine (Neupro patch); and (2) anticholinergic drugs: trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin). Carbidopa/levodopa by itself may provoke hallucinations, but that is not very common unless combined with other drugs for parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "This chapter suggests that the genesis of well-structured perversions may well be the result of disturbances that occur earlier than had been generally assumed, namely in the preoedipal phase. The challenge confronting psychiatrists was to understand clinical forms of the same perversion, from the mildest to the well-structured perversion, to that occurring in an individual with a florid psychosis. Paedophilia could be classified in the following way: oedipal paedophilia, pre-oedipal paedophilia, and schizo-paedophilia. The motivations underlying the variational form of paedophiliac behaviour are as varied as the motivations driving men and women to pursue dependency, seek security, wreak vengeance, or experience specialized sensations. Well-structured paedophiliac perversions are not uncommon but have received scant psychoanalytic attention, for they do not present themselves for treatment. The patients who undergo treatment greatly fear the possibility that disclosure of their identities and others who enter it are prone to premature interruption. Paedophilia was a defence against death and ageing, narcissistic damage, and deterioration.",

      "title": "Suicidal ideation in older people, a public health matter",
      "abstract": "Introduction Suicide in older people is a critical public and mental health issue which requires attention, given that the ageing population is increasing. Multiple factors, including biological, psychological, and social stressors increase suicidal susceptibility. Unfortunately, elderly are more susceptible to these, such as psychiatric disturbances, physical comorbidities, prior suicide-related behaviours, lack of social support, grief, and increased difficulty in problem-solving Objectives In order to review the risk and protective factors, assessment and prevention of suicide in older adults. Methods Bibliographic research through PubMed and Web of Science. Results Older people can be subdivided into three age groups (from “young old” at 65 years old to “oldest old” after 85 years of age), with suicide being more prevalent in the oldest-old, and overall in men above 75 years old. Previous psychiatric background, suicidal attempts, substance abuse, poor physical health or disability, family psychiatric history, low social support or isolation, and finantial stress most frequently predispose to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts or death by suicide in this community. Besides this, ageing relates to a tendency to cognitive impairment, which affects coping mechanisms, leading to deficits in reasoning and decision-making under stressful circumstances during depressive episodes. This can mediate suicidal ideation and associates to greater lethality methods. Geriatric suicidal attempters have been shown to have greater degrees of cortical and subcortical cerebral areas, including the frontal, parietal and temporal regions, as well as significant loss of volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insula, midbrain, cerebellum, lentiform nucleus and putamen. Abnormalities in these regions can impair executive and cognitive function, attention, problem solving and ultimately be responsible for suicidal behaviour. On the other hand, there are suicide protective elements such as physical and cognitive fitness, quality of life and life satisfaction, marital status, religiousness and social support. A prompt identification of modifiable risk factors and strengthening the protective ones by health professionals can reduce this prospect. Conclusions Suicidal ideation in older people is a multifactorial public health concern given the very high frequency of completed suicides in this population. Therefore, it is urgent to review and further research to build more effective suicide prevention strategies. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "This final paper will discuss attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder. The disorder\r\n itself, abbreviated as ADHD, will be described in detail, its symptoms, possible\r\n causes, types and socio - emotional development of children with ADHD. Children\r\n who are diagnosed with ADHD disorder will have a lack of self-control leading to\r\n such children being often absent and impulsive in performing even the most ordinary\r\n activities. Children with such behavior are often called uneducated because some of\r\n the symptoms are restless sitting, constant activity, running, various aggressive\r\n outbursts, unintentional injury to oneself or others, and the like. In order to avoid the\r\n complete avoidance of such a child by the environment, it should be diagnosed in\r\n time. It will be diagnosed if it affects the child's daily functioning and if it appears in\r\n several environments (kindergarten, parental home, playground). The causes are still\r\n incompletely investigated, but one of the main causes is the hereditary component. In\r\n addition to the hereditary component, possible causes of ADHD are genetic,\r\n perinatal, and environmental factors. A doctor or pediatrician, psychologist, special\r\n educator, speech therapist and child psychiatrist should be involved in diagnosing the\r\n disorder. All of the above experts should carefully study the child, his parents, family\r\n tree and environment because there are no strict tests that would confirm the\r\n existence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Since the symptoms are not the\r\n same in all children, there are three types of ADHD disorder: hyperactive - impulsive\r\n type, inattentive type and combined type. In children with ADHD, regardless of the\r\n type of disorder, parents are important. Children spend most of their childhood with\r\n their parents, so it is ideal for parents to be more informed about the disorder or to\r\n treat the child with an authoritative parenting style. This style of upbringing is\r\n characterized by warmth and care, but also the firm control that children need.\r\n Throughout life, children encounter many condemnations and prejudices even\r\n though they are untrue and the fruit of social ignorance.",

      "title": "[Clinical Handling of Patients with Dissociative Disorders].",
      "abstract": "This paper discusses the way informed psychiatrists are expected to handle dissociative patients in clinical situations, with a specific focus on dissociative identity disorders and dissociative fugue. On the initial interview with dissociative patients, information on their history of trauma and any nascent dissociative symptoms in their childhood should be carefully obtained. Their level of stress in their current life should also be assessed in order to understand their symptomatology, as well as to predict their future clinical course. A psychoeducational approach is crucial; it might be helpful to give information on dissociative disorder to these patients as well as their family members in order to promote their adherence to treatment. Regarding the symptomatology of dissociative disorders, detailed symptoms and the general clinical course are presented. It was stressed that dissociative identity disorder and dissociative fugue, the most high-profile dissociative disorders, are essentially different in their etiology and clinical presentation. Dissociative disorders are often confused with and misdiagnosed as psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia. Other conditions considered in terms of the differential diagnosis include borderline personality disorder as well as temporal lobe epilepsy. Lastly, the therapeutic approach to dissociative identity disorder is discussed. Each dissociative identity should be understood as potentially representing some traumatically stressful event in the past. The therapist should be careful not to excessively promote the creation or elaboration of any dissociative identities. Three stages are proposed in the individual psychotherapeutic process. In the initial stage, a secure environment and stabilization of symptoms should be sought. The second stage consists of aiding the \"host\" personality to make use of other more adaptive coping skills in their life. The third stage involves coaching as well as continuous awareness of their comorbid psychiatric conditions. Lastly, factors preventing the patients' smooth recovery process are mentioned. They include their contact with past and current aggressors, chronic and ongoing stress within the family, including abuse and violence, and comorbid conditions such as depression and chronic medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

Although such knowledge may ultimately help determine the underlying causes of schizophrenia, the principal concern of practicing clinicians should be to diagnose and treat medical comorbidity in individual patients. Nearly 50% of patients with schizophrenia have a comorbid medical condition, but many of these illnesses are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. A fragmented health care system, lack of access to care, patient inability to clearly appreciate or describe a medical problem, and patient reluctance to discuss such problems all contribute to the lack of attention to medical problems in patients with schizophrenia. Psychiatrists and primary care practitioners who treat patients with schizophrenia should make an effort to uncover medical illnesses by using a structured interview or routine physical examination whenever a patient is seen for care.",

      "abstract": "What constitutes a \"mental disorder\" for purposes of the insanity defense? Does mental disorder denote any diagnosable condition listed in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders? Is a mental disorder a disturbance wherein the functional criteria of the appropriate insanity law appear to be met? Or does insanity law define mental disorder apart from functional criteria of insanity? The answer to the last question is that some insanity laws attempt to define or qualify mental disorder, but many do not. Unclarities in the law leave room for unnecessary disagreements between expert witnesses even before the functional criteria for insanity are to be addressed. The potential for confusion is compounded when the defendant's disturbance is ambiguous, amphibious, or both. Schizotypal personality disorder is offered as an example of such a disturbance, and inferences are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating psychotic disorder that affects 1% of adults. Symptoms of the illness are highly variable from person to person but typically include \"positive\" symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, thought disorganization), \"negative\" symptoms (blunted affect, social dysfunction, lack of motivation), cognitive impairments, and mood disturbance. Recurrence of active psychosis, progression of symptoms, and deterioration in all areas of life function are the rule. Given the combination of onset in early adulthood and persistent dysfunction, schizophrenia incurs enormous financial and personal costs. The biological basis of the disorder is not clear but is known to include genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Recent research findings underscore the importance of dopamine systems and maturational changes in the brain. Treatment includes psychosocial interventions to address social deficits, family issues, and functional impairments and medication treatment to control symptoms. Atypical antipsychotic medications are used as first-line pharmacotherapy; clozapine is used for patients with treatment-refractory illness, and depot conventional antipsychotics are used for responsive but noncompliant patients. Optimal treatment is provided in community-based centers with expertise in the disorder. Ensuring adequate support for such treatment, however, is a continuing challenge.",

      "abstract": "The process of separation and individuation is a developmental psychological process, which takes place at various phases of child development within his first three years of life. These phases include the Normal Autistic Phase, the Normal Symbiotic Phase, the Separation-Individuation Phase (with sub-phases Differentiation, Practicing and Rapprochement, On the Way to Object Con­stancy) and the Final Separation and Psychological Birth of the Human Infant. Undisturbed transition through the developmental phases leads to the es­tablishment of psychological structure in the hu­man infant, which means that he reaches autonomy and independence, thus becoming an individual. For children which were born with physical dis­abilities and have their intellectual capacities pre­served (i.e. in cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy etc.), the fulfilment of this process is endangered, because their development was stuck at the Nor­mal Symbiotic Phase due to two types of factors. The first group represents factors of physical dis­ability (i.e. impossibility to move, obtain inde­pendent experiences and, consequently, the inabil­ity to detach from the Object), while the second group represents reactions to this hindrance (i.e. overprotection, which further thwarts attempts to detach from the Object).",

This is a case of a 21 year old female, unmarried, who presented to our OPD with prominent psychotic symptoms, particularly a fixed belief that she was being followed by someone for the last six years. Her elder sister, who was close to her emotionally also developed persecutory delusion of similar content within one year of its onset in the younger sister. Thus when they first presented to the OPD, both sisters had similar type of psychotic presentation. After separation of both sisters, psychotic symptoms improved in elder sister within one month. CONCLUSION: Shared Delusional disorder is not uncommon. The risk of induced delusion is more among those who have high emotional bonding and it disappears following separation of each other. So it is necessary to evaluate the family member of individuals suffering from psychiatric disorder to rule out Induced delusional disorders. The conceptual issues of the problem are also discussed.",

      "title": "Comorbidity between autism spectrum disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. A case series",
      "abstract": "Introduction Autism spectrum disorder is a complex pathology that can occur very frequently with other disorders. It is known to co-occur with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), anxiety disorders or depression. Comorbidity with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be difficult to detect since rigid and obsessive thinking, which in many cases is similar to the obsessions and compulsions of the OCD patient, is part of the core symptomatology of autism spectrum disorder. Objectives To present two cases of patients atteded in the Adolescent Hospitalization Unit with Autism Spectrum Disorder comorbid with OCD Methods Two clinical cases are presented, with review of literature. Results First case This is a 16-year-old male, diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age 4. He begins with intense preoccupation for hygiene, developing cleaning rituals. He begins to develop the idea that his cells are released from his body and that they are sensitive to external stimuli in the same way that he is. He claims that in order for them to be eliminated and “not to suffer” he has to wash them and make flapping movements and avoid their accumulation. He begins to treat with sertraline up to 200 mg with partial response, adding fluvoxamine 100 mg with important improvement of the symptomatology. Second case 17-year-old male admitted to the inpatient unit for isolation and cleaning rituals and fear of contamination. The patient had no past psychiatric history. He had been out of school for 4 months. The patient began to develop a fear of pathogen contamination. He maintained cleaning and checking rituals. He ate only packaged food and spent hours, and slept, in the same corner of the bed. Medication with sertraline up to 150 mg was started with progressive improvement. During the admission a history of evolutionary development was taken, observing a difficulty in the mentalization of other people’s emotions. Very adult and literal speech with difficulty in abstract thinking. He revealed presence of restricted interests throughout his history such as rare languages. Finally, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and comorbid obsessive compulsive disorder was made. Conclusions The comorbidity between autism spectrum disorder and OCD occurs between 37%. This comorbidity can make it difficult to perform psychotherapeutic interventions. This work shows on the one hand an already diagnosed autistic patient who develops an OCD, and on the other hand, how the initial diagnosis is an OCD on which an autism spectrum disorder is detected. This highlights the importance of knowing the comorbidity in order to detect both diagnoses. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders affect a person's thinking, mood, and/or behaviour and can range in severity from minor to severe. Nearly one in five persons have a mental disease as stated by the National Institute of Mental Health. A serious mental illness called bipolar disorder causes extreme mood swings that can range from manic to depressive states. Schizophrenia is a brain condition that leads individuals to perceive reality differently. They cannot distinguish between what they are actually experiencing and what they are just imagining. Both illnesses have a variety of negative effects on the patient as well as the primary caregiver, who may be the patient's family or other relatives. In the case of a patient with mental illness, the family's role is crucial. Family members' long-term caregiving obligations may result in a caregiving burden that negatively impacts the caregivers' quality of life, career and personal relationships. Depression generally undermines carers' ability to fulfil their crucial supportive role towards their relative with a mental illness while contributing to their distress and handicap. Given the high prevalence of caregiver depression, it is critical to address this issue not just by creating therapies to treat caregiver depression once it has started, but also by preventing caregiver depression.",

      "title": "Suicidology and Substance abuse in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for suicidal risk. Suicide currently ranks as the second or third leading cause of mortality among adolescents in developped countries. It has been shown that a history of suicidal act, of depressive disorder and of a substance use disorder (SUD), alcohol and drugs, are the most prominent risk factors for suicidal behaviour among adolescents. Data on alcohol and drug use disorders and suicide consisted primarily of reports on alcohol use disorders and, to a lesser extent, opioid use disorder. The magnitude of the association with other drugs is still unclear. The relationships between substance use disorder and suicidal behaviour are multiple: In the long term, SUD may be associated with increases in stress and co-occuring psychopathology (poor self esteem, feeling of worthlessness, isolation).These elements may reach a level where a suicide attempt is viewed as a means to cope with perceived unsolvable difficulties. During life crises, SUD can also be responsible for inhibiting adaptative coping and desinhibiting suicidal behaviour. Finally, SUD and suicidal behaviour share common vulnerability factors: history of childhood abuse, genetically determined dimensions such as impulsivity or psychiatric disorders, particularly unipolar depressive and bipolar disorder. Given the comorbidity between SUD and suicide, it is essential for treatment and prevention that all suicidal adolescents be screened for SUD and vice versa. Ideally, adolescents who receive diagnosis of SUD and co-occuring suicidality should follow an integrated treatment protocol that addresses both conditions.",

According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

Antipsychotic medications are a first-line treatment, however, most patients experience disabling impairment even after benefiting from antipsychotics, including positive and negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, poor social functioning and episodes of acute symptomatic relapse. Methods Systematic literature review in UpToDate and Pubmed. Objectives To identify the most relevant intervention areas of systematic rehabilitation in schizophrenia. Clinical case 45 years old schizophrenic male who admitted in a Medium Stay Psychiatry Unit with severe behavioural impairment and psychotic symptoms. At least 10 hospitalizations and pronounced disability in basic life skills despite optimal treatment. Poor insight and compliance, frequent relapses, co-morbid substance abuse and difficult family support. Clozapine was added to his treatment with improvement in psychotic symptoms. A multidisciplinary intervention was also done and he was discharged home with important improvement in social skills, better insight and familiar functioning Discussion Despite following an adequate antipsychotic treatment, including Clozapine as the main medication in resistant schizophrenia, it is often partially effective with severe impairments in social and occupational functioning. Family-based interventions, cognitive behavioural therapy and social skills training, added to this medication seem to be essential in the systematic treatment of schizoprenia. It includes a multidisciplinary team and a specific length of time but it is based on the patient's status. Despite evidence of their efectiveness, the availability of these interventions varies widely, as does the availability of clinicians to provide them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Personality disorders are enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate markedly from those expected by the individual's culture; these inflexible and pervasive patterns reflect issues with cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning and impulse control, and lead to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fourth Edition, defines two specific personality disorders, in addition to an eleventh condition, Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. Cluster A personality disorders include paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personalities; of these, Paranoid Personality Disorder probably is most common in the legal arena. Cluster B personality disorders include antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality. Such people may suffer from frantic efforts to avoid perceived abandonment, patterns of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, an identity disturbance, and impulsivity. Legal issues that involve individuals with cluster B personality disorders often involve determination of causation of the person's problems, assessment of claims of harassment, and assessment of the person's fitness for employment. Cluster C personality disorders include avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality. Two case histories illustrate some of the complexities of assessing impairment in workers with personality disorders, including drug abuse, hospitalizations, and inpatient and outpatient psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "In psychiatry, stigma means negative marking of the person only because s(he) has a diagnosis of mental disease, and usually this refers to schizophrenia. Stigmatization is related to prejudice, i.e. negative attitudes that are deeply rooted on false beliefs that schizophrenia cannot be treated. In principle, stigma is caused by combination of ignorance and fear which represents the basis of the creation of entrenched myths and prejudice. From a historical point of view, schizophrenia as a disease remains for public, one of the medical areas that are related to fear, a sense of discomfort, prejudice and avoidance. A combination of difficult mental disease, discrimination and stigmatization can be devastating for mentally disabled patients. Throughout history, stigma played significant role in patient's emotional and social isolation from other people deepening their suffering. A common consequence of stigma is discrimination which represents violation of basic human rights. Mentally disabled patients are often unjustifiably seen as dangerous, incapable, irresponsible which causes their isolation, homelessness and economic collapse. Thereby, possibilities for normal life, work, treatment, rehabilitation and social integration are decreased.",

It is suggested that the term should now be used only as a descriptive adjective when there is a morbid preoccupation with health or body. Social and cultural factors are outlined, as well as problems of measurement. The psychopathology, as formulated by Freud and others, is also described. Clinical aspects are discussed under the headings of general symptoms, pain, smell, bodily appearance, sexual, gastro-intestinal, cardio-respiratory, eyes, and ears, nose and throat. Psychiatric syndromes mentioned are: hypochondria as a possible primary state, personality disorders, phobic-anxiety state, neurasthenia, obsessional neurosis, hysteria, depression, paranoid psychosis and organic. In general, hypochondriacal symptoms seem to make the prognosis rather worse. Treatment is to be aimed at the primary condition, which is most commonly depression, anxiety state or conversion reaction.",

Anxiety; It refers to situations that affect individuals and disrupt their functionality to the extent that they disrupt daily life, which may be real or only felt in a fictional way. It is a kind of anxiety and fear. Depression is a deeper mental health issue than sadness; It is painful and can be debilitating.

Features of depression include emotional, thought and behavioral disorders; and ranges from moderate to severe. It can affect not only the patient but also the person's family.

      "title": "Introduction: Emotion and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Given the complexity and exquisite regulation of emotion described in previous chapters, it is not surprising that emotional dysfunction lies at the core of a variety of psychopathological conditions. The syndromes of emotional dysregulation lie on a continuum of temporal characteristics, ranging from seconds/minutes (panic attacks) to hours/days (borderline personality disorder) to weeks/ months (unipolar and bipolar illness) to years/lifetime (schizophrenia and autism). The panic/anxiety disorders are characterized by paroxysmal episodes of panic, sometimes superimposed on more chronic components of dysphoria, agoraphobia, and depression. The marked mood lability of borderline personality disorder and its interdigitation with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) syndromes are typified by extremely rapid and major mood shifts. Included in this phasic dysregulation are prominent components of anxiety, depression, proneness to substance abuse, and chaotic experience of the self and relationships to others. The unipolar and bipolar affective disorders range from chronic dysthymia to irregular bursts of recurrent brief depression to minor and major depression to these conditions in the context of hypomania (bipolar II) and fullblown mania (bipolar I). This range of depressive and manic mood disorders is common in the general population and most typical of psychopathologies involving dysfunction of emotional regulation. The schizophrenias are more commonly associated with a persistent disconnection of affect from its appropriate context, and thus they present with prominent autistic components. In childhood autism itself there is an early and chronic breakdown of emotional communication that often involves an absence of normal language and affective responsiveness to others. Given this range of type and temporal dissimilarities among the major psychopathological syndromes of emotion, we chose to highlight in this part several of the more prominent syndromes and components that bridge diagnostic categories Although each of the chapters has a separate focus, it is worth emphasizing the constant interaction and interplay of cognition, emotion, and neurobiology that is important not only for understanding the psychological and neurobiological substrates of affective dysregulation but also for approaches to therapeutics that can also involve each of three domains (affective, cognitive, and somatic) as primary targets.",

      "abstract": "The number of children born with developmental disabilities is increasing rapidly, one such disability is autism. Autism spectrum disorder is developmental disability connected with early childhood, which can be observed through declination in three different development areas: mutual social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication with limited, repetitive and stereotypical patterns of behaviour, activity and interest. Therefore, autism can be categorized as pervasive developmental disorder. Likewise, autism in childhood, atypical autism, Rett’ disorder, other disintegrative disorders, hyperactivity disorder associated with mental retardation and disintegrative disorders, hyperactivity disorder associated with intellectual disability and stereotyped movements, Asperger's syndrome and others, can also be categorized as pervasive developmental disorder. Autism symptoms in the beginning are not very visible, which can be crucial problem when identifying a diagnosis. The diagnosis of autistic disorder is based on anamnesis, as is on observing the child in various life situations. However, during the diagnosis, parents experience the lack of emotional support from their social environment, which may negatively affect their acceptance of diagnosis. Outcome of treatment depends on numerous components, while interpersonal relations quality is highly linked with expert team of associates in the health care. In spite of that, health care providers require multidisciplinary approach, including experts from biomedical field, in order to achieve high level of persons independence and her active participation in social community. The aim of this paper is to investigate how parents experience the quality of life of child with an autism spectrum disorder, personal and family quality of life. The data were collected through the self-completion of the survey in the association “Pogled“ Nedelisce in MeĊimurje County. Te sample consisted of a total 35 respondents whose children have autism spectrum disorder, among whom there were no statistically significant differences in experiencing quality of life. The results indicate a relatively moderate satisfaction with the life quality of families with children with autism spectrum disorder, enjoyment of spending family time together, mutual family support, support they receive from people close to their family, and provided health care.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY. While auditory hallucinations are considered a core psychotic symptom, central to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, it has long been recognized that persons who are not psychotic may also hear voices. There is an entrenched clinical belief that distinctions can be made between these groups, typically, on the basis of the perceived location or the 'third-person' perspective of the voices. While it is generally believed that such characteristics of voices have significant clinical implications, and are important in the differential diagnosis between dissociative and psychotic disorders, there is no research evidence in support of this. Voices heard by persons diagnosed schizophrenic appear to be indistinguishable, on the basis of their experienced characteristics, 36from voices heard by persons with dissociative disorders or by persons with no mental disorder at all. On this and other bases outlined in this article, we argue that hearing voices should be considered a dissociative experience, which under some conditions may have pathological consequences. In other words, we believe that, while voices may occur in the context of a psychotic disorder, they should not be considered a psychotic symptom. doi:10.1300/J513v06n02_04 [Article copies available for a fee from The Haworth Document Delivery Service: 1-800-HAWORTH.

Symptoms re-occurred in early adulthood after medication had been discontinued by the patient. While he had symptoms characteristic of ADHD before age seven, these were present episodically and only in the context of significant mood disturbance and behavior disruption, which were more characteristic of mood disorder than oppositional behavior associated with ADHD. His reaction to stimulants alone was significant. His response to Ritalin suggested dysphoria and/or neurovegetative slowing. On Dexedrine, he developed frank visual hallucinations. Both reactions can be typically seen in youths with underlying mood or psychotic disorders. This patient's symptoms and their repeated occurrence, in the face of significant family history of mood disorder, demonstrate the utility of DSM-IV criteria and longitudinal history taking in making the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in prepubertal children.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados.

      "abstract": "The nature of association between depression and disabling illness, whether as an organic symptom or emotional consequence, has been the source of interest and controversy. Depression in three groups of medically ill, disabled patients (Parkinson's disease, right hemisphere stroke, and amputation) was studied. Mean depression severity and frequency of depression were equal for all groups. Severity of neurologic symptomatology was not consistently related to depression. Type of prosthesis, but not amputation type, was related to depression for amputees. Patterns of depression on discriminant analysis did differentiate the groups. A depression symptom conglomerate suggesting guilt and body image change with fatigue characterized the Parkinson patients most and the amputees least. A second depression conglomerate suggesting indecisiveness and thoughts of death or self-harm characterized amputees most and stroke patients least. Depression as an emotional response may not be a singular, specific feature of disabling illness in general, given uniformity of prevalence and severity, but differential etiology in specific instances should be considered.",

If criteria are met for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. If the child’s symptoms do not meet the full criteria for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, NOS.

      "title": "Psychobiology and treatment of borderline personality disorder",
      "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder can be characterized in terms of a profile of abnormal deviations on multiple personality dimensions using the temperament and character inventory (TCI). Borderline patients show poor character development, including low TCI self-directedness (irresponsible, blaming) and low TCI cooperativeness (hostile, intolerant). Their temperament is explosive or unstable due to a combination of high TCI harm avoidance (anxious, shy), high TCI novelty seeking (impulsive, quick-tempered), and low reward dependence (cold, aloof). Consequently they are usually dysthymic with an admixture of anxiety and anger, and regulate their social problems and intense emotions in immature ways. Genetic and psychobiological studies have led to identification of biological correlates of each of the TCI dimensions of personality, including individual differences in regional brain activity, psychophysiological variables, neuroendocrine abnormalities and specific gene polymorphisms. Each dimension of personality involves complex non-linear interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors and, in turn, each personality dimension interacts with the others in influencing the way an individual directs and adapts to his or her life experiences. Systematic clinical trials have shown that these personality variables predict the response to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. For example, high harm avoidance and low self-directedness predict slower response and more rapid relapse with both antidepressants and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Treatment with drugs and/or psychotherapy can be individually matched to the patient's profile of temperament and character traits, rather than treating a heterogeneous group of patients as if they had a discrete, homogeneous illness. Fundamental change in cognitive schemas depends on attention to all aspects of character, especially self-transcendence, which has previously been neglected in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Personality integration requires non-resistance to our natural intuitive awareness, rather than intensified intellectual and emotional defenses.",

Stress has long been considered an important factor in the etiology of psychosis and psychotic disorders. Specifically, stress is thought to interact with pre-existing biological vulnerabilities to trigger psychosis through complex changes to various biological processes (e.g., changes to HPA axis, neurotransmitter activity, and inflammatory processes). This chapter includes discussion of a wide variety of stress experiences, including daily hassles, life events, trauma, childhood adversity, and minority stress, and explores the scientific evidence linking these stressors with psychosis and psychotic disorders. Biological processes and biomarkers associated with both stress and psychosis are also discussed. Finally, important questions relating to the future study of stress and psychosis are considered.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "Depression is more common in old age than dementia yet is underdiagnosed and undertreated. It is important to recognise that patients may not always present in a typical way, features that may indicate depression include anxiety, a preoccupation with somatic symptoms, and a change in function. The presence of understandable triggers and causes should not deter GPs from offering treatment, as long as symptoms are pervasive and continuously persist beyond two weeks. Age-related disabilities and changes to physical health are major risk factors for depression in older people. Vascular diseases, including stroke, MI and diabetes increase the risk of depression, both through direct effects on the brain and the psychological effects. Likewise, dementia is a risk factor for depression. Psychological factors such as loneliness and loss of a valued role, as well as social factors related to retirement, bereavement and reduced independence may also increase the risk. Patients with a previous history of depression and anxiety disorders are at increased risk of depression in later life. Assessment and diagnosis are largely based on a careful history. This should focus on eliciting current features of depression, which have been present for at least two weeks, and are associated with a significant change in function. It is important to exclude organic disorders including anaemia, B12 and folate deficiency, and hypothyroidism that may mimic symptoms of depressive disorder. Referral to specialist mental health services is indicated in the following cases: diagnostic difficulty, poor response to treatment, psychotic symptoms, significant psychiatric comorbidity or a risk of self-neglect or suicide.",

It is unclear whether the frequency of these disorders increases or decreases with age. Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important. Psychiatric disorders, common among the elderly, have consequences that include social deprivation, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, disability, increased risk for somatic disorders, suicide, and increased nonsuicidal mortality.",

La identificación del duelo complicado es central para poder ofrecer tratamientos adecuados.

En este estudio descriptivo participaron un total de 68 personas que habían sufrido una pérdida, al menos seis meses antes de la evaluación. Completaron una batería de pruebas sobre intensidad del duelo y psicopatología. Los resultados señalan que todas las variables psicopatológicas mostraron altas relaciones significativas con la intensidad de síntomas de duelo. La centralidad con que se percibió la pérdida y los sentimientos de hostilidad predijeron en gran medida los valores de duelo complicado y con mayor intensidad de experiencias de duelo y de síntomas psicopatológicos. El perfil sintomatológico en duelo complicado se relaciona con un gran abanico de psicopatología. La pérdida de un hijo parece ser un importante factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de duelo complicado. The loss of a loved one may provoke complicated grief, which is characterized by intense symptoms of yearning, sadness, or loss of life meaning. Identifying those at risk of developing complicated grief is crucial to provide adequate treatment. However, little is known about the symptom profile or the influence that the type of loss may have on grief intensity. A descriptive design was carried out. A total of 68 participants that have lost a loved one due to death, at least six months ago, took part on the research. They completed a range of emotional self-report measures. All psychopathological variables showed high and significant relations with the intensity of grief. The centrality perceived and feelings of hostility predicted the score of complicated grief. Finally, the loss of a son was associated with complicated grief and with higher scores on the experiences of loss and emotional psychopathology. Symptom profile of those with complicated grief is associated with a large number of psychopathological variables, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of a son seems to be an important risk factor for developing complicated grief.",

As the letter's author describes,1 while low mood and flat affect can sometimes produce similar observable behavioral features, including reduced psychomotor activity, the processes controlling these symptoms may differ considerably. In humans, low mood is typically measured using the patient's own self-reported assessment of their internal state, whereas flat affect is often identified by analysis of the patient's facial expressions, speech, and movement. However, modelling and measuring these symptoms in animal studies is considerably more challenging. Indeed, as we cannot assess the animal's subjective experience of low mood, we are limited to measuring behavioral changes that are often associated with low mood, including reduced motivation to seek rewards. Similarly, assessment of emotional reactions, or the lack thereof, in animal studies of flat affect is difficult; however, several methods have been reported for assessing orofacial reactions to rewarding and aversive emotional stimuli in non-human primates and rodents.2-4 The use of these methods to further investigate the neurocircuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying the altered functioning contributing to low mood and flat effect, as suggested by the Research Domain Criteria framework,5 may help to identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of these symptoms.

      "title": "Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders as a Risk Factor of Suicide and Homicide among Patients with ADHD: A Mini Review",
      "abstract": "To discuss the role of substance-related and addictive disorders (SRAD) that lead patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to suicide and homicide.Relevant articles were searched via PubMed using several keywords related to this issue. Most of the articles included in this review were published after 2000.Patients with ADHD often fall into crises of catastrophic life events such as suicide or homicide. SRAD play an important role in leading ADHD patients to such events. Because ADHD is characterized by inattentiveness and impulsivity, any kinds of substances, legal or illegal, can deteriorate ADHD symptoms, leading ADHD patients to such catastrophic events. There are several pathways that connect ADHD with SRAD, which are roughly divided into two ways: internalizing mental disorders and externalizing mental disorders. The former includes depression and anxiety disorders characterized by self-inhibition or withdrawal. The latter typically includes conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, as well as antisocial personality disorder, characterized by aggressive or antisocial behaviors or emotions towards others. These comorbid psychiatric disorders are apt to lead ADHD patients to SRAD, and once these patients suffer from SRAD, risk of catastrophic life events seems to increase due to the irreversibility of their adverse mentality. Comorbid mental disorders with ADHD can act, at least partially, as mediators from ADHD to SRAD.SRAD can be a critical risk factor of suicide and homicide among patients with ADHD. Early interventions for families with ADHD and psychiatric comorbidities may work as effective preventive strategies against such events.",

Misidentification syndromes have been rarely reported in patients with primary non-psychotic conditions. The subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may present unusual and rare symptoms. In this case report, we present an OCD patient who exhibited a misidentification ritual to decrease his anxiety arising from horrific images of someone assaulting his wife and children. He substituted the face of assailant with the faces of three different previously known individuals. For this case, we supposed that this ritual was related to an autogenous obsession and also was associated with schizotypal personality traits. To our knowledge, this is the first case exhibiting misidentification rituals related to non-delusional violent images in a patient with OCD.",

As the onset often occurs in youth, there is a clear imperative for early identification and intervention to ameliorate, if not prevent, associated distress.An extensive search of relevant databases and an ancestry search was undertaken.There is a limited but growing body of literature on this topic that is discussed in relation to a clinical staging model, which may prove to be a useful framework for identifying where an individual lies along the continuum of the course of a depressive illness thus allowing interventions to be matched for that stage. The identification of a subsyndromal and prodromal stage of depressive disorders provides early intervention opportunities.It is argued that a clinical staging heuristic may increase the number of those treated early, which may in turn delay or prevent onset, reduce severity, or prevent progression in the course of depressive disorders.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The interaction of the schizophrenic with the milieu of the acute ward is discussed from a psychoanalytic point of view. In the acute phases of the disease, the schizophrenic experiences internal chaos. While he is undergoing such internal stress, he will constantly be trying to adopt globally to the milieu, and he will seek relief by transposing (projectively) his chaotic feelings onto everyone on the ward. This will affect and stress members of staff. As they are affected by this stress, interactional patterns involving both staff and patients may emerge: chaos, splitting and persecutory patterns. Chaos is seen as the primary reaction, while splitting and persecutory patterns seem to arise from within the staff. If the members of staff are not attuned to the pathology of the patient, they may react in such a way as to aggravate the problem. It is unfortunate if the unconscious feelings of guilt in individual staff-members, for appearing to persecute the patient, lead to their 'acting out'. During the initial stages of hospitalisation, the schizophrenic seems to need the help of a psychotherapeutic approach from the multi-disciplinary team to alleviate his inner chaos. However, during the later stages, he will be better helped by more limited contact with a responsible key-worker, or, even better, a psychotherapist in a regular psychotherapy programme adapted to his needs.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, carry a substantial risk of suicide, particularly during the first-episode psychosis (FEP) phase. This narrative review aims to identify key symptomatic predictors of suicidal behavior in individuals experiencing FEP by thoroughly analyzing existing literature. Studies highlight that the highest suicide risk occurs around the initial presentation for psychiatric services. This critical period encompasses the month before and the 2 months after the first contact with mental health professionals. Severe depressive symptoms and a prolonged duration of untreated psychosis emerge as primary risk factors for suicidal behavior. Depression, when combined with cognitive impairments and a history of childhood trauma, significantly increases the risk of suicidality. These combined factors create a compounded effect, making it more difficult for individuals to cope and increasing their feelings of hopelessness and despair. In addition, poor premorbid functioning—referring to the level of psychological and social functioning before the onset of psychosis—and substance abuse, particularly the use of stimulants, further exacerbate the risk. Substance abuse can also intensify symptoms and impair judgment, leading to an increased likelihood of suicidal behavior. This review underscores the critical importance of timely, comprehensive, and tailored interventions. Early detection and intervention can significantly mitigate the risk of suicide in patients with FEP. Providing targeted treatments that address depressive symptoms, cognitive impairments, and substance abuse issues can improve overall outcomes and enhance the quality of life for these individuals. Comprehensive care approaches and strategies to improve functioning are also essential in reducing suicidality and promoting long-term recovery.",

Although their form of clinical presentation may be similar, their evolution and prognosis are very different. It is very important to detect the possible factors of chronicity in order to make an early intervention and thus to diminish the negative consequences of the disease.We conducted a 2 year prospective study in 48 patients diagnosed with acute psychosis in their first admission. Data was collected on the evolution and follow-up of the patient in the Mental Health Unit and the sociodemographic and clinical factors of the psychotic index episode that could predict a change in the diagnosis during the two years follow-up were analyzed.None of the sociodemographic or clinical variables studied could predict a change in the diagnosis, except for the presence of a control delusion during the index episode. The diagnosis of schizophreniform or not otherwise specified psychotic disorders predicts an evolution towards schizophrenia or affective psychosis while a brief or substance-induced psychotic episode has a better prognosis, with a tendency to maintain the same diagnosis in the 2 years of follow-up.After 2 years of follow-up, an significant number of the patients initially diagnosed of acute psychosis evolved towards a diagnosis of schizophrenia or affective psychosis in a difficult-to-predict way.",

      "title": "Childhood depression: early risk and resilience and introducing solids to infants",
      "abstract": "The carefree exuberance associated with young children can make the concept of childhood depression difficult to imagine. It is not surprising then that the existence of mood disorders in children has gained acceptance only in the last few decades. While debate continues regarding conceptualisations of childhood depression, evidence from over 20 years of research suggests that the major affective disorders often begin early in life. This article will outline current knowledge of childhood depression, including recent etiological evidence and implications. There is no formal diagnostic category specifically for childhood depression, with the mood disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) intended to apply to both adults and children. The key feature of clinical depression is a persistently depressed mood, or pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. However, for children and adolescents, this mood may be one of irritability rather than sadness. Associated symptoms include feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, energy loss, and unusual changes in appetite or weight. These symptoms may occur in the context of major depressive disorder, which is marked by acute depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks, or in dysthymic disorder, in which such symptoms persist chronically for at least two years. Also grouped with the mood disorders is bipolar disorder, which is characterised by intermittent manic episodes. While this article focuses on unipolar depression, much of this information may apply to the less understood disorder of bipolar depression also. --------------------- For a number of years there had been some controversy over the appropriate timing of complementary foods to infants. It is with this background that the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested a review of the literature to establish the appropriateness of their recommendations. As a consequence, new guidelines were released in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The new guidelines recommend that complementary foods should be delayed until 6 months. It has been stressed in the literature review, however, that this is a population based recommendation and that infants must be managed individually so that appropriate interventions are provided (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004). By all standards of good nutrition, babies younger than four months who are exclusively breast-fed, or appropriately artificially fed, should not be given solids. The case for delaying complementary foods is based on the health of breast-fed infants and their mothers. The strongest evidence for the recommendation from the infants’ perspective is a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the absence of any growth deficit. For mothers, the benefit is in prolonged lactational amenorrhoea and greater post-partum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004).",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is considered one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood, characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. Even though a strict definition of this entity is constantly sought, ADHD is an often redefined and reconceptualized syndrome. Epidemiological studies show large differences in the incidence, pointing out that the effort of actual taxonomic systems to offer objective diagnostic criteria have not yielded substantial results. Bipolar Disorder (BD) with onset in childhood is distinguished from the adult form by the scarcity of affective symptoms. Very often, neither depressive mood, nor hypomanic euphoria are in the front line being covered by irritability with crises of violence. Children or adolescents have consecutive cycles, which include brief episodes of depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed periods without free intervals. There was a delay in the recognition of this clinical picture. Τhe diagnostic criteria in the actual taxonomic systems are not separated from those of adults and according to some studies the disorder is under diagnosed mainly in European countries. The contemporary literature deals largely with the relationship ADHD - BD in young people because the two disorders share the same clinical picture with slight variations. Τhe differential diagnosis in favor of BD is mainly based on the presence of affective disorders in the family. The main questions raised are whether there is comorbidity, whether ADHD is overdiagnosed against BD or whether ADHD represents a prodromal manifestation of early onset BD. Children with comorbid ADHD and BD tend to express mostly a stimulant phenotype with a chronic course and have higher rates of antisocial conduct disorder. This particular phenotype suggests a symptomatic continuum between ADHD and early onset BD which is possibly responsible for the difficulties met in differential diagnosis and differences in the rates of comorbidity. It seems that the earlier the onset of BD more often it is combined with symptoms of ADHD which often precede mood disorders. The relationship between BD and ADHD is not just a nosological problem but has important implications for treatment. The confusion regarding diagnostic evaluation and the relationship of these two clinical entities is reflected in the proposed course of therapy particularly with regard tο pharmacotherapy. Τhe elevated rates of comorbidity between ADHD and BD observed in the USA, but not in other countries, are possibly due to the frequent use of stimulants.The dilemmas that arise for the diagnosis of ADHD, BD and their relationship refer to the difficulty of defining the limits of normal and abnormal in the mental health of children and adolescents and of the construction of a taxonomic system that respects the particularities of this developmental age spectrum. To achieve this goal, the search for objectivity in diagnostic criteria is not sufficient but one must also keep in mind psychodynamic factors that put children at the heart of their personal history.",

Mood disorders are classified according to their intensity. A distinction is made between, in descending order of severity, bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymia. The mood disturbance of the true manic-depressive is sufficiently severe to cause a marked impairment in occupational functioning and in social activities and relationships. Some manic-depressives also experience psychotic episodes characterized by delusional thinking, hallucinations, and/or bizarre behavior. Instead of engaging in truly manic behavior, with its increasingly explosive highs and potentially suicidal lows, bipolar IIs and cyclothymics are prone to hypomanic behavior, or “mildly” manic states. These hypomanic episodes alternate with depressive episodes during which people lose interest and enjoyment in normally pleasurable acts and events.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

Set against the backdrop of a continuum of depressed mood, from normal reaction to life events (eg, bereavement) through to severe depression with marked anhedonia, psychomotor retardation, and neurovegetative changes (so-called melancholia), we have struggled to understand the diversity of mood disorder. Furthermore, we have struggled to determine whether we can tease out distinct subgroups of etiological significance or, alternatively, whether in reality these reflect manifestations along a continuum of severity.1 Within this schema, psychotic depression has long been considered the most severe form of depressive illness,2 a conceptualization that positions psychotic depression as distinct and potentially independent of other major psychoses, most notably schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Thus, psychosis research currently wrestles to reconcile traditional concepts of categorical diagnosis with contemporary evidence favoring a dimensional approach to nosology, pathobiology, and treatment.",

(2) Between schizophrenic-accentuated syndromes associated with regularly symptomatic epilepsies and genuine (endogeneous) schizophrenias, there are quantitative but no qualitative differences. Often there is a congruence and no possibility of differentiating in the transverse study. This is also true both for the affective and the cognitive disturbances ('structure of consciousness'); the latter are not suitable for separating the psychopathological syndromes of epilepsies. A discrimination between 'genuine' and 'symptomatic' schizophrenia is no longer meaningful. (3) A true (hereditary) coincidence of (genuine) epilepsy and schizophrenia occurs obviously very seldom. (4) Numerous findings are presented, concerning the conditions in which schizophrenic-accentuated syndromes appear. The following relevant factors are discussed: hereditary, latency, duration of illness, type and frequency of seizures, type and localization of EEG foci, type, extent and topography of brain lesions, quantity and quality of psychopathological findings as well as 'organic' psychosyndromes. The possible triggering of psychoses by psychosocial factors, low intelligence, chronic folate deficiency and other specific risk factors and the role of neurotransmitter disorders (GABA hypotheses) are discussed. Finally proposals are made concerning prevention and therapy. Especially often diagnosed non-alternative schizophrenic syndromes in epileptic patients must be controlled by blood levels of antiepileptics. There is a transitional rank, constituted by defined determinants between the poles epilepsy and schizophrenia or a converging course of those syndromes. The results should lead to more frequent EEG and CT eventual magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography-investigations in schizophrenic patients.",

      "abstract": "treatment may benefit childhood disintegrative disorder: presentation of two cases Childhood disintegrative disorder is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by normal development of verbal and nonverbal communication skills, social interaction, play, bladder and bowel control and motor behavior at least in the first two years, followed by regression between 2-10 years of age in two or more of the abovementioned developmental areas. Childhood disintegrative disorder is accepted to be very rare and the exact nature is still unknown. The cases of childhood disintegrative disorder mimic various disorders, especially at initial stages may confuse clinicians to diagnose. Ttherefore presentation of further clinical cases will assist clinicians to manage in the characterization of the disorder in different settings. Studies related to childhood disintegrative disorder are rare in literature. The purpose of this paper is to present the pharmacological intervention of two cases of childhood disintegrative disorder with risperidone. The first case was characterized by an onset of irritability, defiance and hyperactivity at age of four years, later followed by regression in language, bowel and bladder control and social interaction skills. The second case was a child in which the disorder started with regression in language as well as behavior disturbance at four years two months of age, and then language regression, poor bowel and bladder control and decline in social interaction skills were noticed. Risperidone was used as a pharmacological agent in both cases to control behavioral problems and benefit was achieved.",

      "abstract": "Our 26-year longitudinal study and other longitudinal studies confirm older views that outcome for schizophrenia, while showing some variation for different schizophrenia patients, is still significantly poorer than that for other psychiatric disorders, with the exception of the dementias. Our research leads us to propose that risk factors, either stress related or those related to vulnerability to psychosis, account for the episodic course of periods of recovery followed by periods of recurrence that is experienced by most schizophrenia patients. These risk factors interact with personality, temperament, and cognitive traits that, while not causing psychosis, influence its course. It is these interactions that account for the heterogeneous outcome trajectories of different subgroups of people with this condition. Our research and that of others has focused on the contributions of these risk factors, such as vulnerability to trait anxiety, poor developmental achievements before the illness, personality traits such as locus of control, cognitive styles, neurocognitive impairments, length of untreated psychosis, and several others. Despite the proven efficacy of antipsychotic medications over the short term, there is a subgroup of schizophrenia patients who, a few years after the acute phase, function adequately or experience periods of recovery for a number of years, without treatment.",

In the writer's own case psychosis eventually encroached after real persecution, severe life stress and enhanced arousal and was prompted by an ascription of high distinctiveness to self and a low distinctiveness to others. The impact of coincidences generated and confirmed an interpretation of an externallocus of control. Abnormality ('illness') was reflected in a massive escalation of confirmation blas. It is argued that psychosis has its own intrinsic motivation; that life events must be understood in a developmental context; that cognitive factors, often critical, can sometimes be tied to emotional determinants and that gross damage to the self concept, with consequences for spiritual life, plays a causal role in psychosis. A genetic fragility, which biases ongoing emotional and cognitive life, is nonetheless strongly indicated.",

      "title": "Specificity of basic symptoms in early onset schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Developmental psychopathology addresses several important questions of the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders proposing a conceptual framework, which includes developmental psychology, neurobiology and clinical psychopathology. The first question to be raised is the contribution of normal developmental processes to the pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms, ending up with the second question, what impacts psychopathology itself may exert on normal development concerning defects, vulnerabilities and disturbances of age-dependent adaptive processes [11]. Normal cognitive and emotional development seems to be a prerequisite for symptom formation. These assumptions may help us in the interpretation of different psychotic and prodromal phenomena in children and adolescents. Looking at the table of ages, we find overlapping disturbances in various age groups. First manifestations of pervasive developmental disorders - Kanner-Autism [7] - can be detected in the age group from birth to six years. Asperger syndrome [2] may be particularly detected in the age group between six and nine years. In this age group also very early onset psychosis can be elucidated, which shows predominantly formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect. Very early onset psychoses presenting with hallucinations and delusions rather seem to start off in the age group between nine and twelve years. Of these patients, 60% show developmental disorders of speech and language, and about one third present with pervasive developmental disorders in prodromal stages [1]. Early onset psychoses with a lifetime prevalence of about 0.23% begin in the age group between twelve and eighteen [3]. Adult psychosis presents with prodromal features that reach back into ages around and before puberty [5]. From an epidemiological point of view all these groups of disorders may be found during the adolescent age.",

      "title": "A Patient with Chronic Schizophrenia Presenting with Multiple Deliberate Self-Harm and Genital Self-Mutilation",
      "abstract": "Introduction Patients with severe psychiatric illnesses have a greater risk of suicide compared to the general population. (1) Suicide is the major cause of mortality in schizophrenia, (2) and deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a strong predictor of suicide in schizophrenia. (3) Deliberate self-harm is prevalent among patients with schizophrenia. One study reported a rate as high as 48% over a follow-up period of 14 to 17 years. (4) Five characteristics are considered significant predictors of DSH in schizophrenia: past or recent suicidal ideation, a history of DSH, a past depressive episode, drug abuse or dependence, and a higher number of psychiatric admissions. (4) Social and environmental factors, such as being married, (5) lack of stimulation and interaction with others have also been identified as risk factors for DSH. Deliberate self-harm can be extremely harmful and can lead to permanent damage that affects daily functioning; 2 examples are self-inflicted eye injuries, (6) such as enucleation, and genital self-mutilation, such as autocastration. (7) We report a Chinese patient with schizophrenia with repeated self-harm, including genital self-mutilation. This is an illustrative case demonstrating the risk factors for DSH, also prompting thought about the phenomenon of hypoalgesia. Case Report Mr. A, a 49-year-old Chinese man, had his first episode of DSH in 1992, 2 years after he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Mr. A was born in Hong Kong, the youngest of 8 siblings. His eldest brother suffered from a psychiatric disorder--the exact nature of which could not be identified--and died in his 40s of unknown causes. Mr. A studied up to Form 1 then quit school due to poor academic results. He worked in factories and, more recently, as a cleaner. He had no history of substance abuse but had been smoking for 20 years. He married when he was 28 years old and had 2 sons. His wife left him 10 years ago, taking the 2 sons with her, following a quarrel over Mr. A's gambling on horse racing. They have had no contact since then. Mr. A moved to live with his father, with whom he felt he had a close relationship. After his father's death 2 years ago, he lived alone in a flat. He was described as quiet and introverted. Mr. A led a solitary life, enjoyed music and horse betting. Mr. A became known to the mental health service in 1990 when he started attending an outpatient psychiatric clinic for 2 episodes of psychotic symptoms. He was admitted to a psychiatric ward a year later for attacking 2 passers-by in the street as he felt they were talking about him. Prior to that incident, he had failed to attend his outpatient appointments and stopped taking his medications. He believed a computer located in the factory at which he had previously worked was producing itchiness, movements of his mouth, and pornographic ideas in his mind. After admission, he was prescribed with haloperidol and fluphenazine depot injections. His psychotic symptoms resolved. In 1992, Mr. A was admitted again, after he amputated his left index finger. One week prior to this event, he heard his thoughts being echoed as fragments of sentences. On the night of the amputation, he suddenly realised that someone wanted to harm his elder son while he was washing the dishes in the kitchen. Believing that he could prevent this by chopping off his left index finger, he acted on the idea immediately. He was fully conscious and did not experience any pain. His wife promptly called an ambulance. After an emergency operation, he was transferred to the psychiatric ward, when he reported hearing voices talking to each other. One voice told him that the reason for his finger-amputation was to release various gods and fairies to save the world. He believed the voices were from a traditional Chinese god and a devil, Kwun Yam and Tin Gau respectively. He had no regret about his act. He was transferred to a psychiatric unit after stabilisation of his physical condition. …",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is still a real mental health problem; although most epilepsies are curable, their psychopathological consequences are often significant and complex to manage. In this framework, the association of epilepsy with psychotic disorders has long been known.To discuss the links between epilepsy and psychosis, we report the observation of a 52-year-old man, treated for complex focal epilepsy, admitted to a psychiatric department for auditory and visual hallucinations and a behavioural disorder not improved by antiepileptic treatment alone or an antipsychotic alone.Psychotic symptoms in epilepsy can be part of intercritical, post-critical or alternative psychoses. In our patient's case, the psychotic symptoms were post-critical and alternative. It was probably an associated schizophreniform disorder. Emotional indifference and activity restriction are rarely encountered in this setting, while rapid mood fluctuations are frequent. Delusional themes are often mystical, fueled by auditory and unusual visual hallucinations. Negative disorders are rare.Epileptic psychoses have not been identified as nosographic entities in the psychiatric classification systems (DSM-V and ICD-10), which poses a problem in recognizing these disorders. Therefore, a collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists is necessary to understand this complex comorbidity better, avoid diagnostic errors, and optimize management.",

Patients were assessed at two phases of their disorders (the acute phase and the phase of partial recovery). The results suggest (1) disordered thinking is not unique to schizophrenia; (2) distinctions between mild and severe levels of thought pathology are important; and (3) disordered thinking is influenced by acute psychopathology and acute upset. Inferential evidence suggests (4) disordered thinking fits along a continuum with normal thinking; (5) \"thought disorders\" are not a discrete, separate entity, standing apart from other aspects of thinking; and (6) older concepts about primary symptoms in schizophrenia need reexamination.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by delusion, hallucination, formal thought disorder, disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms (e.g. emotional blunting, decreased initiative, impoverished speech etc.) and cognitive dysfunction. Though not described as diagnostic criteria, cognitive dysfunction is the strongest determinant of functional recovery as it has a gradual deteriorating effect on social and occupational functioning. It precedes coincides and outlasts positive symptoms. Among different cognitive abilities it affects attention, memory, processing speed, social cognition and executive function most. Recent studies are showing schizophrenia affects those who have compromised cognitive function or low IQ. Moreover different brain imaging techniques have shown structural and functional abnormality in certain areas. This article has tried to answer few questions like, are cognitive dysfunctions inevitable in schizophrenic patients and if it is then what are the areas what is the nature of affection. It is also important to know how and why they affect the long term outcome of this disorder.",

      "title": "Fraser's “Dissociative Table Technique” Revisited, Revised: A Strategy for Working with Ego States in Dissociative Disorders and Ego-State Therapy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The challenge in the management of a number of the dissociative disorders–which is not present in any other psychiatric or physical disorder–is the need to manage a person who has a dissociative plurality of self identities. Each self identity or ego state believes in its own separate existence, and that it can relate to the outside world without any need of the other co-existing ego states. The primary treatment of dissociative disorders is psychotherapy (and psychopharmacology when Axis I comorbid disorders cause functional impairment), much like the psychotherapy of other disorders. However, in treating dissociative disorders, it is often necessary for the therapist to interact with the various ego states. To ignore the clients' subjective reality of such ego states often leads to therapeutic failure, a fruitless focus solely on the comorbid conditions, termination of therapy, or a flight to another therapist. Effective therapy most often results from the recognition and acceptance of the subjective reality of the client's separate ego states and the ability of the therapist to lead the client towards a dissolution of the amnestic barriers and disharmony of these ego states. For many clients, however, the switching of ego states is chaotic and uncontrolled. The Dissociative Table Technique offers a technique to allow clients to recognize internal ego states, and to structure and control switching and internal communication. It is an adjunctive strategy to the psychotherapy and has proven successful in establishing internal cooperation and integration of the various ego states. Drawing on principles from hypnosis, gestalt therapy and clinical experience, the strategies of the Dissociative Table Technique allow the therapist to teach the dissociated person to facilitate interaction of ego states, and to integrate and eventually join or fuse the dissociated ego states into a consistent sense of self brought about by the cooperation and coawareness of all ego states who learn to function as a unit. This is an expanded and updated version of the original publication of this technique (Fraser, 1991).",

      "title": "Evolving Notions of Schizophrenia as a Developmental Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract We review the changing conceptions of schizophrenia over the past 50 years as it became understood as a disorder of brain function and structure in which neurocognitive dysfunction was identified at different illness phases. The centrality of neurocognition has been recognized, especially because neurocognitive deficits are strongly related to social and role functioning in the illness, and as a result neurocognitive measures are used routinely in clinical assessment of individuals with schizophrenia. From the original definitions of the syndrome of schizophrenia in the early 20th century, impaired cognition, especially attention, was considered to be important. Neurocognitive impairments are found in the vast majority of individuals with schizophrenia, and they vary from mild, relatively restricted deficits, to dementia-like syndromes, as early as the first psychotic episode. Neurocognitive deficits are found in the premorbid phase in a substantial minority of pre-teenage youth who later develop schizophrenia, and they apparently worsen by the prodromal, high-risk phase in a majority of those who develop the illness. While there is limited evidence for reversibility of impairments from pharmacological interventions in schizophrenia, promising results have emerged from cognitive remediation studies. Thus, we expect cognitive interventions to play a larger role in schizophrenia in the coming years. Moreover, because youth at risk for schizophrenia can be identified by an emergent high-risk syndrome, earlier interventions might be applied in a pre-emptive way to reduce disability and improve adaptation. The notion of schizophrenia as a developmental neurocognitive disorder with stages opens up a window of possibilities for earlier interventions. ( JINS , 2017, 23 , 881–892)",

It differs from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a number of ways, the most salient of which are the lack of a tendency toward numbing of responsiveness, which creates a very different mode of experiencing the “world of trauma”, and the inclusion of a category of relational symptoms. Whereas, in PTSD, there is overutilization of avoidant coping, PTRS involves the overuse of emotion-focused coping. The nature and psychosocial consequences of this syndrome are delineated.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

It is concluded that these results probably indicate that there has been a fall in the incidence of schizophrenia in North-East Scotland.

Even the wisdom of Freud has failed to offer us a readily acceptable explanation of hysteria, and to this day medical literature contains many theses suggesting that hysteria is related to disorders of the diencephalon, or to glandular dysfunction, and other such organic approaches to the problem. Seemingly we have no yardstick by which we can measure to what extent the hysteric is born, predestined by some elusive factor to develop the malady, and to what extent hysteria is imposed on persons by environmental circumstances. Much significant information on hysteria may be neglected by those who study it as an isolated phenomenon or disease entity, whereas it may well be that the truth of the matter is that at least a little bit of the hysterical reaction goes to form most of the neurotic syndromes met with in practice, and that the pure hysterical reaction is only an academic concept.",

(1) 'Schizophrenia-like' interictal (periictal) psychoses in the epilepsies, which are not rare, appear to be true schizophreniform (= schizophrenic-accentuated) syndromes in a setting of 'clear' consciousness. There is no case of alternative psychosis and EEG 'forced normalization'. (2) Between schizophrenic-accentuated syndromes associated with regularly symptomatic epilepsies and genuine (endogeneous) schizophrenias, there are quantitative but no qualitative differences. Often there is a congruence and no possibility of differentiating in the transverse study. This is also true both for the affective and the cognitive disturbances ('structure of consciousness'); the latter are not suitable for separating the psychopathological syndromes of epilepsies. A discrimination between 'genuine' and 'symptomatic' schizophrenia is no longer meaningful. (3) A true (hereditary) coincidence of (genuine) epilepsy and schizophrenia occurs obviously very seldom. (4) Numerous findings are presented, concerning the conditions in which schizophrenic-accentuated syndromes appear. The following relevant factors are discussed: hereditary, latency, duration of illness, type and frequency of seizures, type and localization of EEG foci, type, extent and topography of brain lesions, quantity and quality of psychopathological findings as well as 'organic' psychosyndromes. The possible triggering of psychoses by psychosocial factors, low intelligence, chronic folate deficiency and other specific risk factors and the role of neurotransmitter disorders (GABA hypotheses) are discussed. Finally proposals are made concerning prevention and therapy. Especially often diagnosed non-alternative schizophrenic syndromes in epileptic patients must be controlled by blood levels of antiepileptics. There is a transitional rank, constituted by defined determinants between the poles epilepsy and schizophrenia or a converging course of those syndromes. The results should lead to more frequent EEG and CT eventual magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography-investigations in schizophrenic patients.",

This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered.

      "title": "Comorbid social anxiety and body dysmorphic disorder: managing the complicated patient.",
      "abstract": "Patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) have an obsessive preoccupation with an imagined defect in appearance or, if a slight physical abnormality exists, a grossly excessive concern with it. This preoccupation causes significant distress or impairment of social, occupational, or other functioning. Social anxiety is a prominent component of BDD, and social avoidance resulting from BDD symptoms may markedly impair social functioning. In severe cases, avoidance of social situations in combination with occupational and academic impairment may result in patients becoming housebound. The prevalence of BDD is 1% to 2% in the U.S. population and 11% to 12% in patients with social anxiety disorder. Behaviors associated with BDD include mirror checking, physician visits, hair grooming, use of cosmetics, and social avoidance. Distress over BDD may lead patients to undergo repeated cosmetic surgeries in futile attempts to conceal or correct perceived defects. Additionally, depression and suicide are frequent complications of BDD. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for the management of BDD with coexisting social anxiety are presented in this article.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung. Suizidprävention und Behandlung von Suizidalität bei Adoleszenten ist ein komplexes Unterfangen. Subjektiv erlebte Insuffizienzgefühle, Hoffnungslosigkeit und das Gefühl der eigenen Nutzlosigkeit, kombiniert mit einem konkreten Suizidwunsch und dem Vermögen, diesen in die Tat umzusetzen, sind wichtige Indikatoren zur Einschätzung des Suizidrisikos. Suizidversuche als stärkster Risikofaktor für einen Suizid sollen immer ernst genommen werden, auch wenn diese im Rahmen von situationsbedingten Problemen auftreten. Persönlichkeitsmerkmale wie erhöhte Impulsivität oder Kränkbarkeit sind zu beachten. Die Früherkennung psychischer Störungen wie Depressionen, Angststörungen, bipolar-affektiver Störungen oder Erkrankungen aus dem psychotischen Formenkreis bietet die Grundlage für eine effektive Behandlung der zugrundeliegenden Probleme und bringt eine grosse Chance zur Reduktion der Suizidhäufigkeit mit sich. Besondere Vorsicht ist geboten, wenn eine komorbide Suchterkrankung vorhanden ist. Während einer suizidalen Krise erweist sich die Aufrechterhaltung oder Etablierung tragfähiger Beziehungen mit dem Betroffenen als zentraler Wirkfaktor. Bei Suizidalität und zunehmendem Rückzug aus Beziehungen ist der frühzeitige Einbezug von Experten dringend angezeigt. Bei akuter Suizidalität muss die Einweisung in eine psychiatrische Klinik in Erwägung gezogen werden. Persönlichkeitsbedingte wiederkehrende Suizidalität benötigt spezifische Behandlungsansätze für die zugrundeliegende Problematik unter Berücksichtigung der Vermeidung einer iatrogenen Verstärkung.",

Changes in energy levels, sleep patterns, ability to focus, and other features can dramatically impact a person’s behavior, work, relationships, and other aspects of life. Most people experience mood changes at some time, but those related to bipolar disorder are more intense than regular mood changes, and other symptoms can occur. Some people experience psychosis, which can include delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Objectives Through this research we aimed to identify all the special features of bipolar depression which will help the clinical psychiatrists in easier diagnosis and management of the disorder. Methods Literature review (PubMed) Results Clinical Characteristics in Favour of Bipolarity in Depression: psychomotor retardation, history of psychotic depression,history of psychotic depression shortly after giving childbirth, frequent catatonic symptoms, atypical depressive features, severe impairment in interpersonal relationships, inconsistency in business life, history of hypomania, mania or mixed episode,common feeling of numbness and anhedonia; less common sadness and feelings of guilt, mood instability, volatility in temperament, frequent change in affect, daydreaming during the episode and daily life, short duration of depression &lt;3 months, poor cognitive functions during depressive episode, generally similar symptom severity during the day and night etc. Conclusions This leads to misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar depression, which in turn leads to delayed correct diagnosis and treatment and may severely affect the patient’s entire life.

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Personal assistance for children and adolescents (0‐18) with both physical and intellectual impairments",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to impairment as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular activities as a result of impairments, and a person's participation in education, social life, work, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (WHO 2003). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms disability or handicap. This review will include children and adolescents with both physical impairments and intellectual impairments, which include learning impairments (e.g., Down's syndrome, global developmental delay, or pervasive developmental disorder), learning disability (also called ‘intellectual disability’ or ‘mental retardation’) and acquired brain injuries. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently. Therefore, young people with intellectual impairments only or physical impairments only will be considered in other Cochrane and Campbell reviews, as will working-age adults and older adults. Around the world, about six hundred million people have impairments (UN 1990), most of whom live in the developing world. Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (UN 1990) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates. The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have ‘profound’ impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (Hogan 1997). Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (Alberman 1991; Allen 1993; Doyle 1995). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (Middle 1996; Williamson 1983; Wilson-Costello 2005). Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by (Hogan 1997)). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (Hogan 1997). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (Newacheck 2004) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (Newacheck 2004; UN 1990). Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (Hogan 1997). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (Wenger 1995). As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings. A discourse of disability ethics has evolved to discuss concepts of independence, defined not as people with disabilities “doing everything” for themselves, but as having maximum control over how help is provided (Morris 2001). Proponents of the social model of disability regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (Abberley 1987; Oliver 1990). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., making buildings accessible), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem. Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when physical, social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (Hammal 2004; Mihaylov 2004). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (Hogan et al., 1997). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (Lavigne 1993; Neely-Barnes 2004; Pit-Ten 2002; Varni 2005). Limited participation in activities may have negative impacts on the mental and physical functioning of children and adolescents and may lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Children and adolescents with intellectual and physical impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (Witt 2001). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (Moss 2000). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (Rossiter 2001; Sharpe 2002; Thyen 1998). Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments (Newacheck 2004). However, children and adolescents with impairments require varying degrees of support. For example, in one large study, ‘those in the upper decile of the expenditure distribution accounted for 65% of all charges’. Costs born by families of children and adolescents with the most severe impairments were similarly high; out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (i.e. those not reimbursed by insurance or a health service) for the top 10% of the distribution accounted for 85% of all out of pocket expenses (Newacheck 2004). All children and adolescents require some level of care. However, children and adolescents with extensive impairments may require many hours of assistance every day in addition to the normal assistance required by their peers. Consequently, family members (notably mothers) may withdraw from work and social life. Caring for a child with severe physical impairments can put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (Neely-Barnes 2004; Witt 2001). In the U.S., parents of children with impairments are less likely to have attended college and more likely to be single and poor (Hogan 1997). The stress of caring for children with impairments may have negative impacts on parents, but some problems associated with impairments may increase the risk of impairment. For example, poor children are less likely than their peers to receive preventive healthcare (Newacheck 1988) and depressed mothers are less likely than other mothers to use injury prevention strategies like car seats and electrical plug covers (McLennan 2000). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the development of intellectual impairments is affected by sociodemographic factors (Resnick 1998). Low birthweight black babies are more likely than white babies to survive (Morse 2006), which might affect the relative prevalence of impairments in different racial groups; however, ‘controlling for socioeconomic differences and family structure, black children are no more at risk of functional limitation than whites’ (Hogan 1997). Since the causes and consequences of impairments are often difficult to disentangle, retrospective studies are difficult to interpret. Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, mental and physical health of children and adolescents. There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with impairments. For example, school schedules may be designed such that children and adolescents with impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (Colver 2005). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Assistive devices, skills training, physical therapy, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities. Personal assistance is support given to children and adolescents with impairments living in normal housing (e.g., family homes or school accommodation) to enable them to participate in mainstream activities in various settings. Personal assistance is directed by users and their representatives and is designed to promote independence and to reduce strain on families. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance is provided by non-professionals; it may aim to improve mental and physical health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance may be purchased by governments, insurance providers, or individuals. It may be provided directly or indirectly through payments or vouchers. Personal assistance differs from voluntary or charitable services over which users do not have the same control. It also differs from respite care, which is temporary and aims to help carers rather than children and adolescents with impairments. Personal assistance is designed for people whose participation in many normal activities would be impossible without help. While user needs should be assessed periodically, personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments. For example, the needs of a person with a recently acquired impairment might be different from the needs of a person who has had an impairment from birth and the needs of both might change; personal assistance would be designed to meet their unique needs and would develop with them. In this way, it differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time. Receipt of personal assistance is dependent on the amount of help required by an individual. For example, personal assistance in Nordic countries is generally provided to people requiring at least 20 hours of help per week, though most users have severe impairments and both require and receive substantially more assistance. Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, and the U.S. Services in different countries for different users are called by different names, which often relate to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Eligibility varies around the world. For example, countries that see services for adults as a ‘right’ may not be able or willing to provide comprehensive services for children and older adults. Services for people of different ages may be provided through different mechanisms. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Differences in eligibility affect the number and types of people who receive support and these differences affect the amount and types of support individuals and their families receive. That is, the relative number of people receiving personal assistance and their characteristics vary across countries, insurance schemes, etc. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. Assistants may help children achieve more, but having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users’ need for privacy, or with parents’ own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children. Compared to other ways of compensating for particular activity limitations, personal assistance may create unnecessary dependencies for some people. Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments (e.g., children, people with intellectual impairments, and people in rural areas) may prefer other services, particularly since these groups may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000). While many personal assistants are managed by users or their representatives, the nature of personal assistance can make it difficult to separate the roles that individuals play in supporting people with impairments. For example, Askheim identified one mother of a child with intellectual impairments in Norway who acted both as the manager of her child's payments and as a full-time personal assistant (Askheim 2003). Policies that permit different care arrangements may have substantially different impacts. As the personal assistance movement gained strength, Ratzka noted that ‘there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures’ (Ratzka 1986). Some research now suggests that personal assistance may meet otherwise unmet needs of people with impairments. Shortly after its introduction, a survey of direct payment recipients in the UK found that 40% had a need for additional hours of personal service while 80% of people receiving other services had a similar need (Zarb 1994). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (Socialstyrelsen 2005). To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with both physical and intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to ‘no-intervention’ (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes. Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and participate in normal activities due to permanent physical and intellectual impairments. With the exception of young people living in student accommodation (e.g. residential schools), young people living outside their own homes (e.g., in private or public institutions for people with impairments) will be excluded. Children and adolescents with physical impairments only and intellectual impairments only will be excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. Personal assistance is paid individualised human support that is designed to promote participation of people with permanent impairments. In consultation with experts and the reference group, the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance would could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. For inclusion in this review, personal assistance must have been delivered for at least 20 hours per week. Comparisons might include, either singly or in combination, family care, institutionalisation, on-demand services, escort services, and other alternatives to personal assistance. ‘No-treatment’ and ‘waiting list’ groups will be included even if other services received are no described. These will be treated as separate comparisons. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) will be included in the review, though these comparisons will be discussed separately as the outcomes from such studies would not indicate the effectiveness of personal assistance relative to other interventions. Primary outcomes will include: 1) Global quality of life, both (a) generic measures (e.g., the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; Varni 2005) and (b) specific measures designed for people with particular impairments. Though well-validated measures for the general population will be considered, a review of global health measures found that ‘very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents’ (Riemsma 2001) or for people with both physical and intellectual impairments. 2) User satisfaction. Direct reports will be preferred, though proxies might be used if users are unable to communicate. 3) Participation, including social activities, ability to participate in spontaneous activities, time outside the home, and mobility. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) Unmet needs, particularly the inability to perform activities of daily living. 2) Developmental outcomes, including cognitive milestones, acquisition of skills, and school attendance. 3) Health outcomes, including direct measures of muscle strength, disease, injuries, abuse or pain and indirect measures such as nutrition, emergency room visits or need for hospitalisation or institutionalisation. 4) Psychiatric outcomes, including self-harm, pica (eating non-food substances), and outwardly directed challenging behaviour. Measures might include items from the externalising scale of the Behavior Problem Inventory (Sturmey 1993). 5) Impact on others, including parental (maternal) employment, satisfaction, and quality of family life. For example, measures might include the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; (Ware 1992) or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; (Counsell 1994). 6) Direct and indirect costs, both immediate and long-term. To account for normal development and the changing impacts of impairments, outcomes will be grouped by length of follow-up (e.g., 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years). The organisation of services is often a complicated task and new users or their representatives must train personal assistants. Outcomes measured during the first year of receiving personal assistance will be considered apart from outcomes measured after one or more years to account for this adjustment period, which may not be representative of personal assistance as a whole. As we anticipate many relevant documents will be unpublished, a three-part search strategy will be undertaken in order to maximise chances of capturing all relevant literature. Databases will be searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches will be limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believe it is extremely unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980. No language restrictions will be imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases will be searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) will be searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases will be searched in appropriate languages. No filters based on methodology will be applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies. The authors worked with a reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (Jackson 2005) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that will likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers).

These approaches and any replies will be documented by the authors. Additionally, impairment-oriented email lists (list-servs) will be sent a letter requesting assistance in locating studies. The reviewers will contact authors of all included and excluded studies to request details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Reference lists from previous reviews and from all included and excluded studies will be searched. Relevant websites, including those maintained by users, governments, other agencies, and academics will be searched. From the resultant list of articles, outcome evaluations about people with impairments will be identified through electronic and hand searches. Two authors (EMW and PM) will check titles for relevance. When a title appears potentially relevant, both authors will examine the abstract. If one author feels an abstract might be relevant, the full article will be obtained. Two authors will examine the remaining papers to determine eligibility. Study authors will be contacted if further information could resolve initial disagreements about inclusion. Remaining disagreements will be discussed with the third reviewer (JD). If a consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinating Editor of the CDPLPG will be consulted. A flowchart of the process of trial selection will be made in accordance with the QUORUM statement (Moher 1999). Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM) using a specially developed data extraction form. When more than two treatment arms are included in the same trial, all arms will be described. The following data will be collected for all trial arms: 1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, social and economic status); 2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability); 3) Other interventions received; 4) Outcome measures listed above. The following data will be collected for all studies: 1) Programme differentiation (Dane 1998; MRC 2000), including crossover between groups and the differences between the interventions received; and 2) Context. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) where: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number) (D) random allocation not used. Studies in all quality categories will be considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses. Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (Deeks 2003). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants will be described in the description of studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline. Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews (Moher 1995). At present, evidence indicates that ‘scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually’ (Juni 2001). The following components will be considered in the description of studies: 1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?); 2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?); 3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?); 4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?); 5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (Delgado 2004; Juni 2001); and 6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?). All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison",

      "abstract": "Abstract Clinicians treating individuals with schizophrenia and other psychoses have long been struck by the seeming indifference or unawareness many of these patients display in regard to their own illness. People diagnosed with psychotic disorders have similarly been frustrated with their friends, family members, and doctors who insist they have a serious mental illness when they know that they do not. Owing to its prevalence and to disruption of the therapist-patient relationship, this type of discrepancy in perspective-or what we in the mental health field have labeled “poor insight” -has become integral to our conception of particular psychoses. Poor insight often frustrates attempts by clinicians and concerned family members to render assistance and treatment. Such patients, feeling coerced into accepting medications for an illness they don’t believe they have, understandably resist cooperating with prescribed treatments.",

      "abstract": "It is important to run a family therapy alongside treatment of a patient with depression. The patient's family commits quite a frequent mistake of treating depression complaints as a manifestation of laziness, fatigue and ill will. There are two stages in education. In the first one, the essence of depression to the patient and his family is explained. The second stage of education is to draw attention to the mental and social sphere of the patient. This stage consists of two phases: psychological and social. Therapeutic communication is a specific form of communication. Help is directed to people who cannot make order in their own emotions, thoughts and perceive correctly the surrounding reality. The purpose of communication is also to facilitate the patient's expression of emotions. Therefore, therapeutic communication of a healing nature is the basis for helping mentally ill patients. Suicide is usually committed on impulse in the first, acute phase of depression or after entering the latent phase. Suicide is now considered a multidimensional phenomenon, resulting from the complex interaction of biological, psychological, sociological and environmental factors. The psychological state of people with suicidal tendencies is characterized by three characteristics: ambivalence, impulsiveness, stiffness. Suicide in children and adolescents is of the utmost importance",

On the sample of eighteen mentally disturbed persons, who are diagnosed like highest cases, I was researching diagnostic parameters such as characteristics of the development of personality, the functionality of primary family, abuses of alcohol and other resources of dependence, suicidal behavior and also intelligence and dominant characteristics of personality (according to projective techniques).",

In addition there are several times as many unsuccessful suicide attempts and attempted homicides, mayhems, and serious assaults and batteries. It is safe to say that a large portion of these involve persons with psychiatric disorders and thus fall under medical jurisdiction. Some of these individuals are overtly psychotic: deluded and hallucinated, or uncontrollably depressed, or assailed by intolerable anxiety, guilt, or hostile feelings. More are acutely neurotic, and their acts may be seen as manipulative gestures, or cries for help, or acting-out maneuvers. A large portion have disordered personalities and faulty character structures, often with alcoholism, narcotic addiction, sexual psychopathy, passive-aggressive disturbance, or emotional immaturity, instability, or inadequacy. Frequent accompaniments are adolescent turmoil, marital discord, school or work problems, chronic or terminal illness, or geriatric disease. Thus the physician has usually been consulted before",

      "title": "Palliative Care for People Who Experience Severe Persistent Mental Illness",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are many complexities in psychiatric care of people with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) and care of people at end-of-life. The combination of the two can be particularly challenging with major issues including access to care, care planning, care setting, patient decision-making capacity and autonomy, medication interactions, and patient vulnerability. The significant diversity in SPMI requires a tailored approach to each syndrome and individual. With schizophrenia, there is likely to be greater focus on decision-making capacity. Patients with substance use disorders often require a trauma-informed approach to care, as do patients with personality disorders who also underline need for thoughtful communication between team members. With the highest mortality rate among psychiatric illnesses, anorexia nervosa often demonstrates the similarities between life-limiting psychiatric illness and life-limiting non-psychiatric illness. This chapter also addresses other areas of overlap between psychiatry and palliative care. SPMI can be mimicked by phenomena such as delirium and steroid-induced psychosis or mood lability in acute medical settings. As well, interactions between psychiatric and non-psychiatric medications can be a concern. The authors expect clinical training and provision of care models that combine mental health and palliative care expertise will continue to evolve, with future changes likely having as much to do with ethics and models of care as with more direct management of physical symptoms and mental status.",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing.

      "title": "M42. Metacognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia; Comparisons With Borderline Personality Disorder and Substance Use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background: Metacognition is a psychological function that includes a spectrum of mental activities. These activities involve thinking about thinking and range from more discrete acts, in which people recognize specific thoughts and feelings, to more synthetic acts in which an array of intentions, thoughts, feelings, and connections between events are integrated into larger complex representations. Recently, interest has arisen in the important role that metacognitive deficits may play in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Research has found that many with schizophrenia experience compromised metacognitive capacity and the degree of impairment in metacognition has been linked to negative and disorganized symptoms, decrement in social functioning, and lower levels of subjective indicators of recovery. While metacognitive deficits have been broadly explored in schizophrenia, less is known about whether these deficits are similar or different than those found in other forms of serious mental illness. Methods: To explore this issue, we administered assessments of metacognition using the Metacognition Assessment Scale-Abbreviated, Alexithymia using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and Social Cognition using the Bell Lysaker Emotion Recognition Scale to 65 adults with Schizophrenia, 34 adults with Borderline Personality Disorder (PD) and 32 adults with a Substance Use Disorder. We chose Borderline PD as our primary comparison because this group has also been found to have profound alterations in the ability to recognize and think about one’s own and others’ mental activities. We chose substance use disorder as a third psychiatric condition given that this is a common comorbidity of Borderline PD and Schizophrenia and because it has also been linked with deficits in the ability to reflect about mental states. Results: ANCOVA controlling for age revealed the Schizophrenia group had significant poorer overall metacognition compared to the other 2 groups while the Borderline PD group had significantly lower levels of metacognitive capacity compared to the Substance Use group. Multiple comparisons revealed that the Borderline PD group had significantly higher self-reflectivity and awareness of the other’s mind than the Schizophrenia group. In comparison with the Substance Use group, the Borderline PD condition had lower capacity to assume the perspective of others and the ability to use metacognitive knowledge than the Substance Use group. The Borderline PD and Schizophrenia group had significantly higher levels of alexithymia than the Substance Use group. Differences between the Borderline PD and Substance Use groups generally persisted after controlling for self-report of psychopathology and overall number of PD traits. No differences were among groups were found for social cognition. Conclusion: Results suggest that metacognitive functioning is differentially affected in severe mental disorders, with the deficits found in Schizophrenia being generally more severe than in Borderline PD or Substance Use disorders. Schizophrenia may involve unique deficits in the abilities needed for self-reflection and forming integrated ideas about others.",

      "abstract": "22q11.2 Deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a chromosomal microdeletion that affects approximately 40 to 50 genes and affects various organs and systems throughout the body. Detection is typically achieved by fluorescence in situ hybridization after diagnosis of one of the major features of the deletion or via chromosomal microarray or noninvasive prenatal testing. The physical phenotype can include congenital heart defects, palatal and pharyngeal anomalies, hypocalcemia/hypoparathyroidism, skeletal abnormalities, and cranial/brain anomalies, although prevalence rates of all these features are variable. Cognitive function is impaired to some degree in most individuals, with prevalence rates of greater than 90% for motor/speech delays and learning disabilities. Attention, executive function, working memory, visual-spatial abilities, motor skills, and social cognition/social skills are affected. The deletion is also associated with an increased risk for behavioral disorders and psychiatric illness. The early onset of psychiatric symptoms common to 22q11.2DS disrupts the development and quality of life of individuals with the syndrome and is also a potential risk factor for later development of a psychotic disorder. This review discusses prevalence, phenotypic features, and management of psychiatric disorders commonly diagnosed in children and adolescents with 22q11.2DS, including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia/psychotic disorders. Guidelines for the clinical assessment and management of psychiatric disorders in youth with this syndrome are provided, as are treatment guidelines for the use of psychiatric medications.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of sexual libido are seldom organic, in general they are of psychological origin. It is, however, difficult to obtain a differential diagnosis. One of the first diagnostic considerations must be the establishment of primary or secondary libidinal dificit, or indeed, whether there is no libido at all. In cases of libido disorders with primary libido dificit, depression, organic disease, or side effects of pharmaca may be the cause. Libido disorders in the presence of functional libido, however, must be regarded as primarily psychologically caused. An exception are libido problems in the presence of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vasculatory defeciencies. In these cases libido is either totally absent or appears only secondarily. The symptomatology of libido disorders in the presence of depression, diabetes melitus, and peripheral vasculatory disturbancies, as well as psychologically caused erectile and ejaculatory difficulties are discussed in detail. These groups are compared with respect to libido and behavior involving erection, ejaculation, anxiety and avoidance.",

      "abstract": "Vavovagal syncope (VVS) is not generally associated with cardiovascular, neurological or other diseases, and, therefore, represents an isolated manifestation. Isolated VVS cannot be regarded as a disease for several reasons: spontaneous syncope occurs in about half of individuals during their lives, and the unidentified neural pathways involved in the vasovagal response are probably present in all healthy humans, with individual differences in susceptibility; VVS is induced during tilt testing in several subjects with no history of syncope; during haemorrhagic shock, the vasovagal reaction can be observed in subjects with no history of syncope; about 20% of astronauts, who are selected on the basis of their great resistance to orthostatic stress, experience syncope or presyncope on landing after a short-duration space flight; to date, no genetic basis of VVS has been demonstrated; subjects with VVS are generally normotensive and, importantly, have normal blood pressure regulation apart from the episodes of syncope; hormonal disorders or a generalized state of autonomic involvement, although frequently investigated, have never been clearly demonstrated. Isolated VVS should be distinguished from those forms that start in old age and which are often associated with cardiovascular or neurological disorders, and other dysautonomic disturbances such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity, post-prandial hypotension, and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. In these subjects, VVS appears as an expression of a pathological process, i.e. a disease, mainly related to a generalized involvement of the autonomic nervous system, which is not yet well-defined from a nosological point of view.",

The pronounced and persistent affect, in particular depression in conjunction with hallucinations and/or delusions throughout the whole episode, served as the basis for an episode qualification as the schizoaffective structure. Diagnosis of schizophrenia was confirmed by the extremely low socio-demographic indicators at the time of the manifest episode, by the presence of catatonic or catatono-oneiroid symptoms in more than half of the patients, as well as an incongruence of hallucination plot and/or delusions against the dominant affect. In most cases, the affective symptoms were detected in clinical presentation of a prodrome and significantly more often in the form of depression, in comparison with bipolar and mixed affective disorders. Different clinical manifestations of negative symptoms were revealed in significantly more than half of the patients. The study showed that there is a significant frequency of negative manifestations in conjugation with depression in the prodrome.",

      "title": "Qualitat de vida, adaptació social i estrès en joves amb un primer episodi psicòtic o en risc de psicosi",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIO:\nLa qualitat de vida i el funcionament social han esdevingut bons indicadors per mesurar la millora clinica dels trastorns psicotics, i han estat ampliament estudiats en persones amb esquizofrenia. En les primeres fases de la psicosi el funcionament psicosocial i la qualitat de vida romanen sovint deteriorades fins i tot despres de la remissio dels simptomes psicotics, afectant als resultats a llarg termini de la malaltia. Es frequent tambe que aquest pitjor funcionament estigui present abans de l’aparicio del primer episodi psicotic (PEP), en la coneguda fase prodromica, fase caracteristica dels subjectes coneguts com Estats Mentals d’Alt Risc (EMAR). Per altra banda, el paper de l’estres en l’aparicio d’un trastorn psicotic ha estat objecte d’estudi i ha estat conceptualitzat en el que es coneix com el model de vulnerabilitat-estres per explicar l’etiopatogenesi de l’esquizofrenia: persones amb una predisposicio genetica a la malaltia la desenvoluparan o no en funcio de la relacio amb l’ambient i els successos que esdevinguin al llarg de la seva vida. L’estres pero, tambe ha estat estudiat en altre vessants i processos que afecten l’evolucio de la malaltia, com per exemple en que l’us d’estrategies d’afrontament negatives davant l’estres implica l’empitjorament de la qualitat de vida en pacients amb psicosi, o tambe en el fet que pacients amb psicosi sense ocupacio laboral refereixen majors nivells d’estres que els que treballen, essent la ocupacio laboral un element intimament relacionat amb la qualitat de vida en persones amb psicosi. Alguns elements d’estres clarament identificats dins dels anomentats aconteixements vitals estressats, com ara el maltractament infantil, tambe s’ han associat a una pitjor adaptacio premorbida en pacients que han debutat amb alguna malaltia psicotica. OBJECTIUS:\nL’objectiu principal de l’estudi va ser explorar la relacio entre la qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social en joves amb una psicosis incipient i investigar-ne els possibles efectes mediadors de les mesures d’estres. Per altra banda es pretenia analitzar la correlacio entre el maltractament infantil, com a esdeveniment estressant major, i l’adaptacio social.\n METODOLOGIA:\nAquesta tesi doctoral consta de tres treballs. El primer es un estudi analitic observacional i transversal on es van comparar les mesures d’estres i de qualitat de vida entre un grup de pacients considerats EMAR atesos en el servei de l’Equip d’Intervencio Precoc i un grup de quaranta controls sans. Posteriorment es va estratificar el grup de joves EMAR en funcio de l’adaptacio social que presentaven (baixa o normal segons puntuacions en l’escala d’adaptacio social SASS) i es va analitzar la qualitat de vida en base a aquesta estratificacio. Per ultim es va realitzar un analisi de mediacio per explorar si les mesures d’estres intervenien en la relacio entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida.\nEl segon, es un estudi observacional i prospectiu on es va mesurar la qualitat de vida, l’adaptacio social i les mesures d’estres de forma basal i a l’any posterior a la presentacio d’un PEP. L’evolucio de la qualitat de vida es va analitzar en funcio de les puntuacions en l’adaptacio social. Paral·lelament es van comaprar els resultats basals del grup de joves amb un PEP amb un grup de cinquanta-cinc controls sans i tambe es va mesurar l’efecte de mediacio de l’estres entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida en aquest grup d’estudi. \nEl tercer es tracta d’un estudi analitic observacional i transversal, on es va analitzar la relacio del maltractament infantil amb l’adaptacio social en totes les seves dimensions, d’un grup de joves amb una psicosi incipient utilitzant un model d’equacions estructurals, que permet un analisis multivariant de diferents subconjunts de variables, a l’hora que permet analitzar la relacio causal de variables de diferents grups.\n RESULTATS:\nEstudi 1.\nEls pacients EMAR van reportar taxes d’ocupacio laboral mes baixes, mes estres, pitjor qualitat de vida i menor adaptacio social que els controls sans. La qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social es van associar a les mesures d’estres. Els subjectes EMAR amb baixa adaptacio social van reportar mes estres percebut i pitjor qualitat de vida que els EMAR amb adaptacio social normal i que els controls sans. L’estres percebut va intervenir explicant la relacio que s’estableix entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida. \nEstudi 2. \nEls pacients van reportar una pitjor qualitat de vida, una pitjor adaptacio social i mes estres que els controls sans. Els pacients amb un PEP van millorar significativament la qualitat de vida i les mesures d’estres al llarg de l’any de seguiment, pero no l’adaptacio social. L’estres percebut va mediar l’associacio entre una pitjor adaptacio social i una qualitat de vida inferior. \nEstudi 3. \nEls EMAR van presentar mes negligencia emocional i pitjor adaptacio social comparats amb els PEP. El Model d'Equacions Estructurals (MEE) emprat va mostrar que el maltractament s’associa a una pitjor adaptacio social, principalment en dominis que impliquen relacions interpersonals. Quan els simptomes depressius fan de mediadors, es a dir, que expliquen com es la relacio que s’estableix entre el maltractament i l’adaptacio social, tambe es veuen afectats els dominis d’oci i treball i interessos socio-culturals. CONCLUSIONS:\nL’adaptacio social es menor en els subjectes EMAR que en subjectes sans. Aquesta te un impacte negatiu sobre la qualitat de vida dels joves EMAR. L’associacio entre la qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social esta influenciada per l’estres percebut.\nEn el cas dels joves amb un PEP, l’adaptacio social a l’inici pot determinar la qualitat de vida durant el periode d’un any posterior a l’inici de la malaltia. Malgrat la millora en la majoria de mesures estudiades en l’any posterior al PEP, els pacients no aconsegueixen el mateix nivell de qualitat de vida que els del grup sense patologia. \nPer ultim, els antecedents de maltractament infantil influeixen negativament en l’adaptacio social de joves amb una psicosi incipient.",

Uno de los debates nosologicos mas controvertidos en el ambito de la Neuropsiquiatria versa sobre el diagnostico diferencial entre psicosis adquiridas e idiopaticas”(esquizofrenia) en pacientes que previamente han sufrido un traumatismo craneoencefalico (TCE). Caso clinico. Se expone el caso de un varon de 15 anos, sin antecedentes psiquiatricos personales ni familiares, que a los 5 meses de sufrir un TCE con perdida de conciencia desarrollo un sindrome psicotico cronico caracterizado por sintomatologia positiva, siendo esta resistente a todos los tratamientos psicofarmacologicos prescritos. No se evidencio lesion cerebral focalizada a traves de neuroimagen estructural. Discusion. El TCE puede actuar como agente etiopatogenico primario (psicosis debida a un TCE) o precipitante (esquizofrenia) en los cuadros psicoticos manifestados. Los dos criterios externos que contribuyen en mayor medida a la distincion de ambos trastornos son la escasa sintomatologia negativa y la baja vulnerabilidad genetica entre las personas con psicosis debida a un TCE. Con relativa frecuencia, tanto el periodo de latencia TCE-psicosis como los correlatos neurocognitivos y neurobiologicos asociados apenas permiten esclarecer el estatus nosologico del sindrome psicotico. Son necesarios ensayos clinicos controlados para valorar la eficacia de los antipsicoticos en aquellos sujetos con psicosis debida a un TCE.",

      "title": "Child Abuse Syndrome (CAS): A Newly Recognized Distinct Entity",
      "abstract": "A number of children and adolescents experience stressful events during their life spans, which can affect them both physically and emotionally. Their reactions to these events are usually time-limited, as most of these children recover without further problems. However, a child or an adolescent may experience a severe traumatic event, including situations where someone's life (especially parents’ lives) is threatened or where major injuries occur (e.g., victims or witnesses of physical/sexual abuse or of violence in the home or community, of a car accident, a natural disaster or a war event, or the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness); in these cases, the risk of developing a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) becomes more likely, and is directly related to the severity of the trauma experienced, to the likelihood of the trauma being repeated, and, when the trauma affects a child’s relative, also to the child’s relationship with the victim [1, 2].\r\n\r\nThe American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) has recently proved that PTSD related to sexual abuse in children can manifest itself with unique clinical patterns, including specific signs and symptoms of varying degrees of intensity: losing interest in activities which normally gave them joy or pleasure, a regression to thumb-sucking, bedwetting or other age-inappropriate behaviors, also including loss of talking skills. Other leading hallmarks are the tendency to repeat some forms of behavior previously perpetrated against themselves; the development of a strong attachment to a parent or toward another reference figure; the manifestation of unusual fears regarding early death; and severe concentration problems interfering with learning or social activities. Additional potential consequences in adult life include suicidal thinking, active engagement in suicidal behavior and the onset of addictive relationships to food, alcohol or drugs [3, 4].\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years, increasing evidence of the changes in brain structure and function occurring in abused children suffering from PTSD have been recorded by neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, PECT) and neurophysiological (EEG, ERP) studies on large cohorts, mainly including changes in the frontal-limbic networks, the hippocampus and the amygdala [5, 6]. In addition, clinical and molecular geneticists have suggested and demonstrated that abused children who develop PTSD experience a biologically specific form of the disorder different from those caused by other types of trauma, including distinct genomic alterations and unique epigenetic DNA methylation profiles [7, 8].\r\n\r\nAccording to this recent clinical, neuroimaging, neurophysiological, genomic and epigenetic evidence, independently reported by separate teams of researchers, we propose that, for a better and more accurate clinical and diagnostic evaluation and understanding of the clinical phenotype, the overall manifestations and symptoms caused by child abuse be regarded as a specific and distinct entity, grouped under the term of “Child Abuse Syndrome” (CAS).",

It is caused by conditions that damage the mind, memory, reasoning and speech. Dementia has become increasingly common, and can be detected as early as middle age although it is more common in old age. A positive link between diet and the development of mental disorders is reflected in a strong correlation between the intake of refined sugars and decrease bet awareness of patients with schizophrenia and the development of depression. Mental changes during aging and gradual separation from active social life are usually emotionally reflect the first stage of aging escape into the food, and in the second phase, after 75 years of lethargy, when the food loses its appeal.

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

This psychosis resembles schizophrenia at many points and differs from schizophrenia in some aspects, especially in the course.

We believe it not unlikely that this psychosis is not uncommonly produced by the stresses of civil life but that such cases are thought to be schizophrenia, and that the recognition of such cases may materially alter statistics regarding remissions of treated and untreated patients with schizophrenia.",

Strategies for differential diagnosis of OCD and these disorders, as well as the interactions of the diagnoses in treatment settings, are discussed. The chapter also explores the relationships between OCD and personality disorders, as well as between OCD and the OCD-related disorders. OCD is also characterized by impaired quality of life, family involvement, and varying insight. The presence of OCD is associated with high levels of functional impairment, especially in the social and emotional domains. Relationships with important others can be affected by the disorder. Family members are often involved in OCD symptoms, and family variables like symptom accommodation and hostility are related to poorer treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes can also be influenced by level of insight held by the individual with OCD; those with poor insight into the irrationality of their symptoms often face challenges with treatment engagement. The chapter aims to provide a brief overview of comorbidity, family, insight, and quality-of-life issues and to review assessment and treatment implications of those issues. Measures for assessing relevant constructs are described.",

The actual prevalence varies according to the setting, type and severity of disease, the individual's perception of their condition and premorbid risk factors (e.g. childhood adversity). Depression has a bi-directional causal relationship with physical disease, so each can be a risk factor for the other. Depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur more often than as separate conditions and are often undetected or diagnosed by primary and secondary healthcare staff. People who experience depression and physical illness understand depression as part of their whole life experience and not just as being simply related to their physical health. Depression, and to a lesser extent anxiety, in the context of physical disease are associated with a range of poor outcomes, including poorer physical health outcomes and quality of life; increased hospitalisations, investigations and healthcare costs; and higher mortality.",

Definite correlations between psychopathological and sexual pathological manifestations have been ascertained. Sexual disorders were of a secondary systemic nature and were undetected if the endogenic process began after the completion of all stages of normal psychosexual development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2002) reported that approximately 5–9% of children and adolescents in the United States have a serious emotional disturbance (SED) that significantly undermines their daily functioning in home, school, or community. The SED term encompasses certain diagnostic categories, including autism spectrum dis-order, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other severe anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The commission also reported that, in a given year, about 5–7% of adults have a serious mental illness (SMI). The SMI term has traditionally been defined in terms of diagnosis, duration, and disability. Specifically, the term refers to mental disorders that carry certain diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression; that are relatively persistent; and that result in comparatively severe impairment in major areas of functioning, such as vocational capacity or social relationships.",

Different variants of the course are related to structurally and phenomenologically different variants of affective attacks. The more similar is the course of cyclothymia-like schizophrenia to protracted non-remission one, the more atypical are affective attacks (adynamic depressions and nonproductive hypomania); the more paroxysmal is the course, the more marked and diverse is the clinical picture of depression (dysphoric attacks) and the more typical are hypomanias. Patients with cyclothymia-like schizophrenia, besides therapy, are in need of the earliest possible rehabilitative treatment aimed at the continuation of education under easier conditions which expedites post-attack readaptation and improves social prognosis.",

Schizophrenia is a disabling mental condition thatusually disrupts a person's working life and, because it is a disorder withan onset in adolescence or early adulthood, it often interferes with thenormal development of a career and worker identity. As people withschizophrenia attempt to adjust to their new reality of medications,painful refractory symptoms and profound uncertainty about theirfuture, their efforts at recovery may be hampered by a lack of appropri-ate opportunity for productive activity.

Evidence shows, however, that emotional distress plays a key role in the progression of CHD: (i) emotional distress is associated with pathophysiological mechanisms and cardiac events in coronary patients, (ii) psychosocial treatments of emotional stress may reduce mortality and morbidity in these patients, and (iii) inhibition of negative emotions may accelerate CHD. Evidence also shows that emotional stress as a risk factor for CHD is a chronic characteristic; research has, however, largely ignored the role of personality in this context.

      "abstract": "Abstract Dissociative psychopathology is understood as an immature defence mechanism of personality, based on the techniques of reality distortion. The natural cause of a disorder reflects the lack of sense of coherence between identity, memory, awareness, perception and consequently - goal orientated action. Its symptoms manifest the separation of emotions, thoughts and behaviours bound with an event in order to maintain an illusory sense of control of demanding and unbearable experience. We describe the case of a 57-year-old woman suffering from broad range of dissociative symptoms from early childhood. Decomposition of integrity between memories, a sense of self-identity and control of the body has become the cause of numerous suicide attempts, multiple psychiatric hospitalizations and not fully effective therapy attempts. Destructive influence of psychopathological symptoms negatively influenced patient’s life course, decisions made as well as family, work and social life.",

      "abstract": "As the field of movement disorders has developed and matured over the past 25 years, psychogenic movement disorders have become increasingly recognized in subspecialty clinics. The diagnosis can be challenging and should be based on positive features rather than a purely exclusionary approach. The clinical phenotype can be quite varied, although certain categories of abnormal movement are more common than others. Electrophysiological studies may be particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis, especially with respect to tremor and myoclonus, and an argument can be made for adding a \"laboratory-supported definite\" category to earlier classification schemes. The diagnosis of psychogenic dystonia remains a major challenge, although there are some recent promising developments with respect to the evaluation of cortical plasticity that require further study. The pathogenesis of psychogenic movement disorders is poorly understood; insights may be provided from the study of other neurological conversion disorders such as psychogenic hemiparesis. Psychogenic movement disorders typically result in considerable disability and negatively impact quality of life to the same or greater extent than do many organic movement disorders. Treatment is extremely challenging, and many patients experience chronic disability despite various therapeutic interventions. Given the personal and societal impact of these problems, further advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis and the subsequent development of effective therapies are sorely needed.",

Psychiatric disorder was associated with psychological disadvantage (broken homes, the child had lived away from the family, family history of psychiatric disorder) and with current high levels of parental stress in relation to their children. Disturbed children tended to present with symptoms of anxiety, bed‐wetting, hayfever, nosebleeds or scabies.

Her past history was marked by long-standing dysthymia, a propensity to somatization, drug overdoses and antisocial behaviour, including the killing of her grandson. She had suffered substantial deprivation and abuse from her earliest years. She was considered unsuitable for dynamic psychotherapy because of her personality organization, her use of primitive defence mechanisms and her inability to tolerate frustration, given her propensity to act out in destructive ways towards herself and others. She was managed within a multidisciplinary team in an old age day hospital. This patient illustrates that personality dysfunction does not necessarily ameliorate with advancing age. Less overt manifestations of destructive behaviour, such as sabotage of treatment, starvation and polypharmacy, may be seen in this age group.",

      "title": "Emotional Changes Following Brain Injury: Psychological and Neurological Components of Depression, Denial and Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Neurological components of depression, denial, and other affective changes are reviewed. Rehabilitation is particularly important to improve long-term psychological outcome of patients. Behavior modification can be used effectively to reduce problematic behavior and to support the patient's motivation. Finally, emotional changes in family members, which occur as well, are reviewed, particularly increased depression and anxiety. Emotional difficulties, personality changes, and neurotic reactions may be the most prominent consequences of head injury, especially in the case of mild head injuries. These reactions may be indistinguishable from psychoneurosis to those who are not intimately involved with the head injured individual. In fact, it is more typical for emotional disturbances to be interrelated components of neurologic or cognitive deficits, which can create difficulties in evaluating individual cases. Changes in coping ability caused by the injury are likely to result in reactive, adaptive, psysiologically-generated denial and depression. Changes in coping will often not be seen as multifactorial, and prominent emotional dynamics are likely to cloud underlying issues when problems occur in relationships. Altered coping also occurs in family members in response to the disabled person. A symmetrical process of frustration and helplessness is likely to develop when family members are unware of the organic causes of altered perceptions, coping, and poor judgment of the injured person. An example of thee processes is the case of a 35-year-old woman who sustained a mild head injury and spinal whisplash in an auto accident. She received medical treatment and some rehabilitation for her back and pain problems. Eventually she began to see a psychologist, whom she sought out on her own, because of an increasing depression. The psychologist treated her for a few months, but soon suspected another level to her difficulties and requested an neuropsychological evaluation. This evaluation uncovered significant cerebral dysfunctions which were not only affecting he reasoning and judgment, but also her personal relationships and outlook in major ways. Prior to the accident she had been a well adjusted person, outgoing, and happily employed. After the accident, among other problems, she was alienating her family and husband by being unable to read their emotional reactions as well as the underlying meanings of what they said to her. She perceived their comments in a restricted way-- only as an assault on her control and independence, and not as their attempts to help her see alternative solutions. Thus, attempts to talk through problems with her were unsuccessful because she was relating in a superficial and overly egocentric way. These decificts also meant that she would have great difficulty becoming aware of these or other problems because of the brain injury's affects on her self-awareness. When the family gave feedback to her, it became an exercise in frustration and rejection for her family, and an exercise in frustration and anger for her. Eventually she became more and more depressed in reaction to her neurological condition of denial. Almost three years after her injury, she admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital for triage of her depression. Lezak (1896) considers these types of individuals to be most at risk for serious depression because of the insidious process of alienation which they create as a result of their brain injuries. The neuropsychological evaluation of this case revealed bilateral anterior brain dysfunction, with greater right hemisphere than left hemisphere dysfunction at the time of the testing. This bilateral presence of injury was likely having significant effects on her ability to integrate her perceptions and feelings, to organize her thoughts and feelings, and on system-wide processes such as speed of perception and response. Some research indicates that when the brain is insulted in the right, or nondominant, hemisphere with preservation of the dominant hemisphere, denial, or lack of awareness, is a resulting syndrome. …",

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices. This review article is a good educational material for medical and psychological practitioners whose goal is to improve knowledge and diagnostic processes of psychosis and its related disorders.",

      "abstract": "The deficit syndrome is a domain of schizophrenic psychopathology defined by the presence of primary negative symptoms that are enduring features of a patient's function between periods of relapse. Lesions of the putative neural circuit underlying social affiliation and social behavioral cues in nonhuman primates and other mammals cause behavioral impairments in animals that model the diminished social drive, poverty of speech, and blunted affect of the deficit syndrome. Components of this circuit include the amygdala, periamygdalar cortex, and part of the prefrontal cortex. Abnormal function of this functional circuit may underlie the deficit syndrome.",

Se considera que en mas de las tres cuartas partes de los mayores deprimidos pueden persistir sintomas residuales, dando lugar a estados postdepresivos en forma de depresiones menores, depresiones subum- brales o depresiones subsindromicas. Entre estos sintomas residuales mas frecuentes en los estados postdepresivos destacan las dificultades de concentracion, el enlenteci- miento, la astenia, los sintomas somaticos, los trastornos del sueno o la hipocondriasis. En los mayores son mas frecuentes las de- presiones subclinicas o subsindromicas, que frecuentemente aparecen tras la mejoria de un trastorno depresivo mayor. Los factores que se asocian para la aparicion de estas depresiones subsindromicas son de tipo so- ciodemografico (ausencia de contactos so- ciales), empeoramiento funcional, historia previa de trastornos afectivos, antecedentes de trastornos vasculares cerebrales o facto- res existenciales (preocupaciones sobre el futuro, baja percepcion de salud,..).

      "title": "[Psychopathology and creativity].",
      "abstract": "In this paper, a concept has been presented stating that the process of creativity may be connected with psychopathological features such as mood disorders, mainly bipolar, and psychosis-like thought abnormalities. Biographic studies point to a more frequent occurrence of affective disorders in creative subjects and members of their families. There is also data concerning the occurrence of schizophrenia in the families of prominent persons. A number of studies have demonstrated a similarity of patients with bipolar affective illness and members of their families to creative persons, as to increased indexes of creativity as well as such temperamental features as cyclothymia, neuroticism and openness. An association has been also found between the dimension of\"psychoticism\", schizotypal features and the measures of creativity. A reduction of the so called \"latent inhibition\" mechanism, resulting in perception of seemingly irrelevant external stimuli is connected with a predisposition to both increased creativity and schizophrenia-like disturbances. A neurobiological model of generating ideas and creative drive assumes a dominant role of three brain structures: frontal lobes, temporal lobes and the mesolimbic system. The neurotransmission system mostly connected with elevated mood and psychotic thinking is the dopaminergic system, especially its mesolimbic and cortical pathways. Both neurobiological and pharmacological evidence has been accumulated for an association of these pathways with motivational, emotional and cognitive processes, and indirectly, with the processes of creativity. In recent years, a number of interesting results has also been obtained from molecular-genetic studies about genetic determinants of creativity processes in association with bipolar mood changes and psychotic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Fahr’s disease (FD) is a rare disorder consisting of bilateral and symmetrical calcium deposits in basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. These lesions are associated with neurological and psychiatric symptoms such as a rigid hypokinetic syndrome, mood disorders and memory and concentration abnormalities. It can be idiopathic or secondary to endocrine disorders, infectious diseases or mitochondrial myopathies. Objectives To highlight the importance of considering organic causes when evaluating patients presenting atypical psychiatric symptoms and claim the role of neuroimaging. Methods Case report and non-systematic review of literature: sources obtained from Pubmed database. Results A 69-year-old man, native of Syracuse (Italy), was admitted to the Psychiatry Unit in February 2022 presenting behavioural disturbances and irritability. In July 2021 he presented the same symptoms, being mistakenly diagnosed with Bipolar Disease type I. He has no previous psychiatric history. He started with changes in his personality, short-term memory loss, aggressiveness and disorganized behaviour at the age of 66. At admission he was talkative and hyperfamiliar, presenting delusions of grandiosity, exalted affectivity and insomnia. Neurological examination showed short-term memory problems, signs of frontal disinhibition and abnormal glabellar tap sign. Blood tests, CT brain and MRI were performed to rule out organic underlying causes. Neuro-imaging found bilateral and symmetric calcifications in globus pallidus, thalamus and corpus striatum, in favour of FD. Secondary causes (abnormalities in the PTH, vitamin disorders and infectious diseases such as HIV, brucellosis or neurosyphilis) where discarded, allowing us to conclude it was probably a primary case of FD. Valproate was started as a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant. Genetic tests were indicated. Conclusions FD should be considered as a differential diagnosis in the evaluation of psychiatric symptoms, especially when atypical and/or presented with neurological symptoms. The role of neuro-imaging is essential. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Suicide may occur among patients with very severe epilepsy, but also in patients that recently achieved a complete seizure freedom.

      "abstract": "Depression is less prevalent among older adults than among younger adults, but it can have serious consequences. More than half of cases represent a first onset in later life. Although suicide rates in the elderly are declining, they are still higher than in younger adults and are more closely associated with depression. Depressed older adults are less likely to endorse affective symptoms and more likely to display cognitive changes, somatic symptoms, and loss of interest than are depressed younger adults. Risk factors leading to the development of late-life depression likely comprise complex interactions among genetic vulnerabilities, cognitive diathesis, age-associated neurobiological changes, and stressful events. Insomnia is an often overlooked risk factor for late-life depression. We suggest that a common pathway to depression in older adults, regardless of which predisposing risks are most prominent, may be curtailment of daily activities. Accompanying self-critical thinking may exacerbate and maintain a depressed state. Offsetting the increasing prevalence of certain risk factors in late life are age-related increases in psychological resilience. Other protective factors include higher education and socioeconomic status, engagement in valued activities, and religious or spiritual involvement. Treatments including behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive bibliotherapy, problem-solving therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, and life review/reminiscence therapy are effective but are too infrequently used with older adults. Preventive interventions including education for individuals with chronic illness, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving skills training, group support, and life review have also received support.",

      "abstract": "The author discusses the experience of ‘being invaded’ that is sometimes communicated by certain severely disturbed patients. The complaint can sometimes be couched in terms of bodily suffering and such patients may state that they have the experience of a ‘foreign body’ inside. It is suggested that these patients have suffered severe early failure of containment of their projections, while at the same time they have incorporated primitive characteristics of the object that have been powerfully projected into them. An object that invades in this way, it is suggested, experiences a compulsive need to expel unbearable states of mind using others as a repository. The infant incorporates these violent projections as part of his own mental representational system, and normal identifi cation processes are disrupted. There follows impairment of the development of the sense of self. Clinical examples of how the invasive experience manifests itself in the analytic setting and in the transference and countertransference are presented. It is argued that this highly complex form of early subject‐object interaction (prior to the differentiation of psyche‐soma) is more likely to be found in severely narcissistically disturbed individuals. Some refl ections on the origins of invasive phenomena are given.",

      "abstract": "Thefts without motive of pain have been known since the early 19th century. But the problem has not been solved. While they were formerly considered a mental disease, today they are not seen as something special. But they still happen. Only a small percentage of common shop-lifting can be called a psycholopathologic syndrome. Many explanations and analyses have been published which are discussed in detail. In a group described here comprehensively difficult marital situations full of conflict, marital sexual frustration, depression, physical and mental exhaustion and aggressive and suicidal tendencies are found. Theft appears to be closely connected with these. But the pattern of motivation and causation is by no means stereo-typed. In order to clear up such actions one will have to consider as exactly as possible the biographic connection and what happens during the act - quite apart from somatic conditions. Present assessment in reports is totally unsatisfactory. To clear up the controversial questions is urgently necessary.",

      "title": "Epilepsy after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

In consequence, many of the contributions of psychoanalysis to the study of psychosis are widely known. But they are often looked at with various distortions of perspective. Thus a few enthusiasts consider them a complete explanation of psychotic phenomena. Others regard them as incidental and fail to recognize the almost revolutionary impetus they have given to all branches of modern psychopathology. Still more common has been the error of considering one aspect of the contributions of psychoanalysis to the study of psychosis as though it were the whole. The recognition of sexual symbols in schizophrenic thought, for example, are not infrequently regarded as Freud's chief contribution to this disease. Or the demonstration that the psychotic individual seeks pleasure in infantile ways is labeled a fixation,",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

Psychologists consider personality a long‐term, relatively consistent phenomenon, but healthy individuals are able to adapt their personalities to the demands of various situations. The difference for people with personality disorders is that their behaviors lack flexibility and tend toward extremes that impair their ability to interact well with others, causing problems in their work and family relationships. For example, they may be exceedingly sensitive, hostile, suspicious, deceitful, self‐absorbed, or impulsive, depending on the type of personality disorder they have. Mental health professionals consider personality disorders to be some of the most difficult problems to treat, especially given that most people with these disorders lack insight into the role they play in their own interpersonal problems.

Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient.

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Poor psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia can be conceptualized as an early indicator of chronic neurodevelopmental illness. Alternatively, impaired psychosocial functioning could be the result of social and environmental factors associated with the onset of psychotic illness. We review recent evidence on psychosocial outcome in the early phases of psychotic illness, when young people are less removed from their developmental trajectory, any brain changes may be mutable and there may be greater opportunity for intervention. Recent findings In samples with first-episode psychosis, poor premorbid functioning, stable negative symptoms and impaired social cognition and neurocognition may indicate individuals likely to experience poor psychosocial outcome. There is also some evidence of social/environmental predictors of poor outcome. Recent findings from at-risk samples suggest similar patterns, although more research is needed. Summary It is likely that for some patients poor psychosocial outcome is the result of longstanding neurological changes, whereas for others it is related to the secondary consequences of having psychosis. We suggest that measuring psychosocial outcome in the early stages of psychosis is important for our understanding of the cause of schizophrenia, but argue for the importance of the patient's subjective view on their psychosocial recovery.",

Diathesis-stress hypothesis of schizophreniaSchizophrenia is a complex illness, and its possible causes are still subject of debate.However, according to a widely adopted view, both a biological predisposition, and exposure to environmental stress are necessary ingredients for schizophrenia to become manifest -the so-called diathesis stress model (Zubin & Spring, 1977).A classical example of the association between environmental stress and the risk of developing schizophrenia, comes from studies of the 1944-1945 Dutch Hunger Winter (Susser & Lin, 1992;Susser et al., 1996;Susser et al., 1998).In this discrete period during the Second World War, there was a serious decline in food intake in six cities of western Netherlands.Among people born in these cities between 1944 and 1946, the most exposed birth cohort (i.e., conceived at the height of the famine) showed a twofold and statistically significant increase in the risk for developing schizophrenia (Susser & Lin, 1992).Since this particular famine, many others occurred worldwide, but these were less suitable for epidemiological investigations due to more disorganized conditions (St Clair et al., 2005).However, several years after the Dutch Hunger Winter, a similar occasion occurred in China.Specifically, from 1959-1961, people in affected provinces were starving and died in large numbers due to bad weather (for refs see (St Clair et al., 2005)).Among births that occurred during the famine years, the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life was significantly increased when compared to those born before or afterwards (St Clair et al., 2005).These 'natural experiments' suggest that prenatal stress, i.e., exposure to maternal nutritional deficiency, could increase the risk of schizophrenia in later life.However, evidence from many observational studies that have investigated the association between experience of stress in adulthood and acute onset of psychotic illness, has not been confirmative (Phillips et al., 2007).In particular, there is no consistent evidence that experience of stressful life events is able to trigger onset of psychosis.Findings from longitudinal studies on the other hand, are stronger in linking episodes of relapse in schizophrenia patients to an elevated rate of stressful life events (Phillips et al., 2007;Walker et al., 2008), thus providing additional evidence for a role of stress exposure in (the course of) schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "As a period of transition from childhood to early adulthood, adolescence is often a difficult time. Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of sadness, unhappiness, hopelessness, and even guilt. depression in adolescents is often seen through other symptoms, which look different from the symptoms of depression in adults. When a teenager is depressed, he will show changes in attitude and behavior. Depression in adolescents can occur due to various things, the influence of social media, concerns about posture that are not ideal, or because of decreased academic problems. Often times, teens whose feelings are hurt look for substances or alcohol to make themselves feel better. The more the teenager uses substances to treat depression, the more likely he is to become addicted. That is why parents should be vigilant about children's mental health as well as their physical health. One of the psychological problems with internet addiction that causes depression can be caused by the reduced time spent with friends and family which leads to social isolation. This condition can lead to depression. Because depression in adolescents is often a chronic and sometimes relapsing disease that predicts an increased risk of depression in the adult years and because comorbid substance use disorders can increase the severity of depression. Because comorbid substance use disorders can increase the severity of depression, treatment for depression should always include both the acute and advanced phases. ABSTRAKSebagai periode transisi dari masa anak-anak hingga masa awal dewasa, masa remaja tidak jarang menjadi waktu yang sulit. Depresi adalah gangguan kesehatan mental yang ditandai dengan perasaan sedih, tidak bahagia, putus asa, dan bahkan bersalah. Depresi pada remaja seringkali terlihat melalui gejala lain, yang terlihat berbeda dari gejala depresi orang dewasa. Ketika remaja mengalami depresi, ia akan memperlihatkan perubahan sikap dan perilaku. Depresi pada remaja dapat terjadi karena berbagai hal, pengaruh media sosial, kekhawatiran dengan postur tubuh yang tidak ideal, atau karena masalah akademis yang menurun. Seringkali, remaja yang perasaannya terluka mencari zat atau alkohol untuk membuat diri mereka merasa lebih baik. Semakin banyak remaja menggunakan zat untuk mengobati depresi, semakin besar kemungkinan dia menjadi kecanduan. Itulah mengapa orang tua harus waspada tentang kesehatan mental anak seperti kesehatan fisik mereka. Salah satu masalah psikologis pada kecanduan internet yang menimbulkan depresi dapat disebabkan karena berkurangnya waktu bersama teman dan keluarga yang menyebabkan isolasi sosial. Kondisi inilah yang dapat mengarah pada depresi. Karena depresi pada remaja seringkali merupakan penyakit kronis dan kadang kambuh yang memprediksi peningkatan risiko depresi pada tahun-tahun dewasa dan karena komorbiditas gangguan penggunaan zat dapat meningkatkan keparahan depresi. Karena komorbiditas gangguan penggunaan zat dapat meningkatkan keparahan depresi, maka pengobatan depresi harus selalu mencakup fase akut dan lanjutan.",

Although it characterized by significant severity of clinical state and resistance to psychopharmacotherapy, and may be accompanied by high social risks. Objectives To carry out clinical and psychopathological differentiation of DSPS and to define its personalized diagnostic and prognostic criteria. Methods 66 patients with DSPS were observed (F20.0, F20.01, F20.02 according to ICD-10) by psychopathological, psychometrical and statistical methods. Results Persistent delusional conviction of patient in invasion of certain «spiritual being» (demonic or divine) inside of the body and soul is the specific core of DSPS. The psychotic episode with DSPS has similar pattern with paranoid syndrome of Kandinsky–Clérambault. Although, the structure of the syndrome is varying, and characterized by predominance of hallucinatory or delusion symptoms. According to these varieties two different types of DSPS were identified, which were observed in continuous or paroxysmal course of disease. The forms of destructive delusional behavior were also different for both of these types. Conclusions Delusional Syndrome of Possession in schizophrenia (DSPS) is complex and diverse phenomenon, due to religious content of delusional disorders, which occurs in specific psychopathological structure of psychotic state. This fact may cause controversy both in psychiatric practice and in religious communities. So, the obtained data could be important for social and treatment predicting, as well as for pastoral counseling. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "[Autism, depression and risk of suicide].",
      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a qualitative alteration in social interaction and communication, associated with restricted interests and stereotyped behaviors. People with autism are four times more likely to develop depression, than the general population, it is even considered as the most common mental health condition in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). One of the challenges is to recognize the manifestations related to depression in people with ASD, in whom, in general, it is expressed differently in relation to those with typical development. Depression in people with autism can manifest itself with restlessness and insomnia and not with feelings of sadness, so it is essential to be attentive and not justify all behavioral problems to autism. Young adults with ASD have higher baseline levels of almost all the depression characteristics listed in the DSM-5, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underreporting of depression. On the other hand, adults with autism have an increased risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts, planning suicide, carrying it out and even dying from suicide. Many of them have a history of depression, harassment and loneliness. It is essential the early detection of depression, develop appropriate tools for diagnosis in autism as well as generate awareness of the risk of ideation or suicide, a problem that only in recent years has been addressed with greater depth. In this paper I analyze depression in autism, the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide, prioritizing clinical aspects, their evaluation and risk factors.El autismo es un desorden del neurodesarrollo caracterizado por una alteración cualitativa en la interacción social y la comunicación, asociada a intereses restringidos y conductas estereotipadas. Las personas con autismo tienen cuatro veces más posibilidades de desarrollar depresión que la población general y es considerada la afección de salud mental más frecuente en personas con trastornos del espectro autista (TEA). Es difícil reconocer la depresión en personas con TEA, en quienes, en general, se expresa en forma diferente a las que tienen desarrollo típico. En ellos la depresión puede manifestarse con inquietud e insomnio y no con sentimientos de tristeza, como sería esperable, por ello es esencial estar atentos y no justificar todos los problemas al autismo. Los adultos jóvenes con TEA tienen niveles basales más altos de casi todas las características de depresión enumeradas en el DSM-5, esto puede generar sobrediagnóstico o subregistro de depresión. Los adultos con autismo tienen un riesgo aumentado de experimentar pensamientos suicidas, planificarlo, llevarlo a cabo e incluso fallecer por suicidio. Muchos de ellos tienen antecedentes de depresión, padecimiento de hostigamiento y sensación de soledad. Es fundamental la detección temprana de depresión, desarrollar herramientas adecuadas para su diagnóstico en autismo, y generar conciencia de riesgo de ideación o suicidio, lo que recién en los últimos años ha sido abordado con mayor profundidad. En este trabajo se analizan la depresión en autismo, el riesgo de ideación suicida y suicidio, jerarquizando los aspectos clínicos, su evaluación y factores de riesgo.",

      "abstract": "The inference is reached that the depressive syndrome is by no means alien to the schizophrenic psychosis on the ground of detailed clinical follow-up study of 153 psychotic seizures in 71 patients, affected with various forms of schizophrenia. The depressive syndrome occurs in the clinical picture of most of the patients in the course of the disease, and, more particularly in those suffering from periodic form, in which, not infrequently, alternation of maniacal and depressive manifestations is observed. Dysthymia is the initial symptom of the disease very often. It usually occurs as a response type (similar to hypochondriac or depressive â€žreaction`) with production of insanity and other symptoms ensuing. The depressive syndrome is scarcely manifested in its pure form. Most frequently, depressive paranoid syndrome and depressive hypochondriac syndrome are observed with the insanity production being concomitant to hallucinations and eventually, pseudo-hallucinations and other symptoms of the psychic automatism. The schizophrenic dysthymia and the melanocholic insanity of schizophreniacs might display complete simulation of cyclothymia. However, the insanity in schizofpherenia very often assumes a rather generalized, greatly ridiculous and absurd character. Although dysthymia appears to be the initial symptom of the affection rather frequently, the melancholic insanity is usually manifested much later. Neuroletipcs play a supplementary role in terms of increasing the incidence of cases with depressive pictures and intensification of their manifestations. The higher incidence of depressive syndromes in schizophrenia, recently observed, should be accounted for, frist and foremost by the â€žmilder`, more â€žpsychological` and less â€žbiological` manifestation of the disease.",

The prevalence of psychoses in older people is hard to measure but estimates are around 0.5% of the population. Historically many people with long term illness resided in psychiatric hospitals but now most are in the community, receiving variable amounts of support from mental health, primary care, and social services. The physical health of this population is often poor and they receive less treatment and support than other older people with comparable physical health needs. Problems with psychiatric comorbidity (e.g. depression and substance misuse), cognitive impairment and social exclusion are also common. Treatment includes the judicious use of medication, nonpharmacological approaches, and social support—especially appropriate accommodation. Positive outcomes can be achieved by a recovery approach that attends to all aspects of the person’s health.",

      "title": "The Impact of Childhood Maltreatment on Risk of Borderline Personality Disorder",
      "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a personality disorder characterized by emotional over-sensitivity. People with BPD show symptoms of erratic behavior, having a fear of abandonment, and experiencing unstable social relationships. The factors and elements that influence the development of BPD are uncertain and varied, but there is a correlation between the development of BPD and the person's experience of abuse and other adverse factors. The aim of this review is to understand the factors and elements in BPD development. According to previous studies, emotional and sexual abuse experienced in childhood is a very important cause of the development of BPD. Low levels of caregiver warmth and neglect are associated with the development of BPD symptoms but are not determinative. At the same time, personality traits play an essential role in the resilience of BPD. In addition, BPD often coexists with other psychological disorders. Neuroticism as a personality trait is significantly associated with BPD. Brain differences between BPD and typical controls may lead to differences in their emotions and their ability to regulate emotions, which is related to their ability to control their emotional impulses. This paper illustrates the impact of adverse childhood experiences and negative parenting styles on the risk of BPD. One limitations of previous studies is that most of the studies were conducted on women, and gender differences may lead to a certain degree of bias in the exploration of influencing factors. Future studies should invetigate this topic in larger and diverse samples. This study can contribute to the design of relevant prevention and parent education programs in school.",

      "abstract": "Childhood adversity is associated with the severity of multiple dimensions of psychosis, but the mechanisms underpinning the close link between the two constructs is unclear. Mentalization may underlie this relationship, as impaired mentalizing is found in various stages of the psychosis continuum. Nonetheless, the differential roles of self- and other-mentalizing in psychosis are not well understood. Parallel multiple mediation was conducted for the relationship between a diverse range of childhood adversity types, including intentional and nonintentional harm, and schizotypy (positive, negative, disorganized), psychotic-like experiences (PLE) and paranoia via self-mentalizing (attention to emotions and emotional clarity) and other-mentalizing in n = 1,156 nonclinically ascertained young adults. Significant parallel multiple mediation models were found for all psychotic outcomes except negative schizotypy. The associations between intentionally harmful childhood adversity and psychotic outcomes were significantly mediated by increased attention to emotions for most models and decreased emotional clarity for some models. No significant mediation was found for parental loss. Paternal abuse was only mediated by attention to emotions whereas the effects of maternal abuse were mediated by attention to emotions and emotional clarity. Other-mentalizing only showed mediating effects on one of thirty models tested. Results highlight the mediating role of impaired self-mentalizing in the association between childhood adversity and psychosis. This is consistent with disturbances of self-concept and self-boundary characterizing, in particular, the positive dimension of psychosis. Maternal versus paternal figures may contribute differentially to the development of mentalizing. These results could inform future preventative interventions, focusing on the development and maintenance of self-mentalizing.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nHuman sexual function is complex and affected by many different factors. In patients with mental and emotional disorders such as schizophrenia, biological and psychosocial factors associated with sexual functioning are further complicated by illness and medication effects. Antipsychotic medication, the main modality of treatment in schizophrenia, is known to produce sexual side effects in addition to others such as weight gain and the metabolic syndrome. Because of the sensitive nature of the problem, many patients may not report this side effect to the therapist, though distressing to them, unless specifically asked for it. These sexual side-effects may subsequently lead to nonadherence, distress in patient and /or partner and marital dysharmony. Therefore effective management of this problem is essential. While prevention is most desirable, early identification and effective management of these sexual side effects could improve compliance and quality of life.\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nTo study the nature, prevalence and risk factors for sexual dysfunction in neuroleptic-naive women with psychosis, and to evaluate the incidence of antipsychotic induced sexual dysfunction in these individuals.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nConsecutive antipsychotic drug naive women with schizophrenia or acute psychosis who met eligibility criteria were rated on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for symptom severity and the Female Sexual Function Index for sexual functioning. Weight, blood sugar and prolactin levels were measured. Socio-demographic details were recorded. After six weeks and six months of treatment with antipsychotic medication, the assessments were repeated. Using SPSS for Windows (version 16.0.1), mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical data. Pearson’s correlation and chi square were calculated to assess relationships between continuous and categorical variables respectively.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 104 subjects recruited, prevalence rates of sexual dysfunction were 67.3, 82.8 and 72.22% at baseline, six weeks and six months respectively. Incidence of sexual dysfunction at six weeks was 60%. The most common type of dysfunction was hypoactive sexual desire and orgasmic disorder. Factors associated with sexual dysfunction at different points of time included age, education, age of onset and duration of illness, negative and general psychopathology scores and type of antipsychotic used. Weight, prolactin level and dose of antipsychotic medication were not significantly associated with sexual dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by a significant preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance that causes significant distress and impairment. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most widely studied and empirically supported psychosocial intervention for body dysmorphic disorder. Cognitive behavioral models of BDD theorize that heightened selective attention toward minor details in appearance can lead to a distorted body image. Cognitive behavioral therapy for body dysmorphic disorder consists of cognitive restructuring for maladaptive thoughts related to appearance (e.g., “Everyone is looking at my nose”) and exposure and response prevention for feared and avoided situations related to the disorder (e.g., going into social situations and talking with people one‐on‐one). Additional therapeutic techniques are integrated into cognitive behavioral therapy for body dysmorphic disorder, including psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and mindfulness/perceptual retraining. Flexible modules aimed at addressing common co‐occurring concerns in body dysmorphic disorder (e.g., skin picking and depression) allow clinicians to further individualize the treatment. Special considerations must be taken into account for certain subpopulations such as adolescents, individuals with muscle dysmorphia, and those who are seeking surgery.",

Those suffering from this disorder also show severe impulsivity, self harm, and suicidal behavior, which leads to distress and impairment in day-to-day life. BPD is one of the most widely studied personality disorders owing to it being associated with increased clinical attention and having significant psychosocial impairments. This chapter covers the prevalence, symptomatology, and therapeutic options related to borderline personality disorder. Depersonalization/derealization are core symptoms of BPD and dissociation can be a prominent feature in some individuals with BPD. Research in the dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depersonalization suggested that dissociation might be a form of emotional over-modulation, promoting trauma-related stressful emotions.

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "title": "The Forgotten Child.",
      "abstract": "About 10% to 20% of children and adolescents suffer from some kind of mental health disorder. Many adult psychiatric disorders have their origin in childhood and adolescence. (1) Inadequate or delayed treatment is associated not only with personal suffering, compromised normal emotional and social development, and impairment in multiple domains including education, occupation, interpersonal relationships and self-esteem, but also family and carer stress. Yu et al (2) draw our attention to the mental health of mothers whose preschool children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Provision of a child mental health service in Hong Kong is shared by the Hospital Authority, Department of Health, the educational system, Social Welfare Department, non-governmental organisations, and private sectors. The worldwide trend of rising service demand, increasing public expectations and resource limitations is also noted in Hong Kong. Only some of those in need receive proper mental health treatment and care. (3,4) The underlying reasons vary in different settings. Examples include underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, inaccessibility of service, poorly coordinated and fragmented services, lack of expertise, lack of public (or professional) awareness, and other obstacles to service seeking, such as stigmatisation towards mental problems and mental health care. (5) Different strategies have been proposed and initiatives implemented in an attempt to tackle these challenges. Fung et al (6) describe and discuss the results of a knowledge contact--based anti-stigma campaign in a Chinese society. While mental health problems in some patients are more eye-catching, such as the patient described by Che (7) who readily caught the attention of mental health professionals, others may present with more subtle symptoms. There is always an important but forgotten group of children and adolescents who are in need of more attention and proper mental health assessment and/or intervention but sadly have little access to the existing system. Some are 'at risk' of future development of psychopathology and are simply not being recognised or ignored. Some are hesitant or reluctant to seek help because they fear being stigmatised. Some fail to reach the service 'threshold' for referral. Others simply fall through the cracks because they fulfil nobody's criteria for help. If we agree that we should identify this group of children who are being 'forgotten', where should we invest our effort? It is well documented that mental disorders run in families. Genetic factors play a significant aetiological role in many mental health problems. (8) Siblings of an affected child are at increased risk of psychopathology due to a complex interplay of gene-environmental factors. (9) Chan and Lai (10) explore the psychological adjustment of siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder in Hong Kong. Children of parents who had psychopathologies are another vulnerable group. (11) Peers of suicide completers and attempters are at risk of psychiatric disturbance and suicidal behaviour. (12) Those who have been referred to the mental health service, but subsequently disappear from the system may be a group who deserve extra attention. There is always a group who (the affected child and/or parents) are inadequately motivated to seek intervention or help, and this could be due to multiple different reasons. How much additional effort, given the limited resources (e.g. long waiting list for initial child psychiatric outpatient assessment and long waiting list for psychosocial intervention), are we willing to make to reach out to and engage this group? The dilemma is more obvious for non-priority cases who previously received 'conventional intervention' (e.g. no imminent risk of aggression, suicide, or child abuse). CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) traditionally offers service for those at the severe end of the spectrum, through referral from primary and secondary mental health workers. …",

These include disturbances in perception and inference, abnormalities in communication, behaviour and motor activity, and deficits in emotional expressivity, hedonic capacity and drive. No single symptom or set of symptoms is pathognomonic, and the question of which symptoms are indeed at the ‘core’ of schizophrenia has been an issue of much debate, opinion and study since the disorder was first described a century ago. In this review, the symptoms emphasized in current diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are described and the relative importance of these symptoms in the evolution of the schizophrenia construct is discussed.",

In most instances, adverse outcomes are confined to a minority of children exposed; variations in the severity or pervasiveness of early risk, individual differences in susceptibility, and interactions with later stressors are all thus likely to be important in mediating effects. At present, knowledge of intervening processes is limited, and dependent on retrospective studies of adult samples or short-term longitudinal findings in childhood. We review current evidence on the long-term outcomes of prenatal divorce, childhood maltreatment, and institutional rearing, and on the early antecedents of depression and antisocial behaviour in adult life, to highlight possible interviewing mechanisms. Most long-term sequelae seem likely to depend on a series of shorter-term links, some running through elevated risks of continued environmental adversity, others through psychological vulnerabilities and problems in social relationships.",

This information can assist accurate diagnosis of SAD and inform future nosologies regarding diagnostic thresholds from less severe presentations.

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

      "abstract": "Although DSM-IV acknowledged the clinical significance of some subthreshold forms of unipolar depression, such as minor depression (MinD) and recurrent brief depression (RBD), clinicians continued to struggle with the concept of \"subthreshold\" depression. A substantial number of patients continued to present with depressive symptoms that still did not satisfy any DSM-IV diagnosis. Generally, these patients failed to complain of anhedonia and depressed mood, a criterion that DSM-IV mandates for any diagnosis of depression. Therefore, researchers reexamined the question of whether this cluster of depressive symptoms, in the absence of anhedonia and depressed mood, was clinically significant. Some researchers labeled this cluster of symptoms, \"subsyndromal symptomatic depression\" (SSD). Specifically, SSD is defined as a depressive state having two or more symptoms of depression of the same quality as in major depression (MD), excluding depressed mood and anhedonia. The symptoms must be present for more than 2 weeks and be associated with social dysfunction. Using Medline Search, the authors reviewed the literature on the epidemiology, demographics, clinical characteristics, and psychosocial impairment of SSD. SSD is found to be comparable in demographics and clinical characteristics to MD, MinD, and dysthymia. SSD is also associated with significant psychosocial dysfunction as compared with healthy subjects. Further, it has significant risk for suicide and future MD. Few studies have been conducted on the treatment of SSD. The high prevalence of SSD, the significant psychosocial impairment associated with it, and the chronicity of its course make subsyndromal symptomatic depression a matter for serious consideration by clinicians and researchers.

      "abstract": "Many people with serious mental illness struggle with the symptoms and disabilities that result from the disease and are also challenged by the stereotypes and prejudices that result from misconceptions about mental illness. As a result of both, people with mental illness are robbed of the opportunities that define a good quality life: good jobs, safe housing, satisfactory health care, and affiliation with a diverse group of people. There are still attitudes within most societies that view symptoms of psychopathology as threatening and uncomfortable, and these attitudes frequently foster stigma and discrimination towards people with mental illness. Stigma may result in various forms of exclusion or discrimination – either within social circles or the workplace. Mental health stigma can be divided into social stigma, which is characterized by prejudicial attitudes and discriminating behaviour directed towards mental health problems and perceived stigma which is the internalizing by the mental health sufferer of their perceptions of discrimination. Perceived stigma can significantly effect in feelings of shame and lead to poorer treatment outcomes. It is important to understand the aspect of prejudice against mental illness. By addressing this important issue appropriately, it is easier to create a supportive environment for persons with mental illness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Available data from the literature supporting the hypothesis that partial manifestations of the panic-agoraphobic spectrum may be as clinically relevant as a full-fledged syndrome were reviewed. These partial expressions of disorder may occur singly or in connection with other mental disorders. In particular, we have examined evidences indicating relationships of panic-agoraphobic spectrum with other mental disorders in childhood and adolescence and with psychotic disorders. Their importance in childhood and adolescence is significant because we believe that these symptoms influence adult behavior and are viewed, at a later time, as atypical symptoms. Panic-agoraphobic spectrum syndromes, both in their full-fledged and partial manifestations frequently co-occur with other mental disorders and are likely to be associated with significant impairment either when occurring singly, partially, or comorbidly. Several conditions typical of childhood, such as separation anxiety, school phobia, and other symptoms related to the concept of “behavioral inhibition” seem to be connected with the panic-agoraphobic spectrum and deserve attention in relation to the development of different anxiety and mood disorders in subsequent phases of the life cycle. Identification of panic-agoraphobic spectrum features is also important within the realm of psychoses where they may substantially affect phenomenology, course of illness, and treatment response.",

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare condition with poorly understood prevalence and incidence in the general population. Case reports have described co-occurrences of psychiatric conditions and APS. Previous case reports have indicated that patients with APS can have comorbid psychosis, anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric conditions. The association between APS and psychiatric illness, however, remains under-investigated in longitudinal studies. In this report, we present the case of a woman in her 40s who was voluntarily admitted to the psychiatric inpatient unit for treatment of auditory hallucinations within the context of borderline personality disorder. She reported a rather extensive medical and psychiatric history of several previous illnesses, musculoskeletal injuries, and hospitalizations. Due to the significant social stress and multiple comorbidities, she may be at increased vulnerability to acute exacerbations of both APS and brief psychotic episodes. In this case report, the patient had a history of three hypercoagulability incidents that were shortly followed by psychiatric admissions. This report highlights the importance of considering systemic conditions such as APS in patients presenting with psychiatric illness. Patients with APS and concomitant psychosis may benefit from screening for APS flares in the case of a psychotic break.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia: Improving Outcome",
      "abstract": "Therapeutic advances over the last four decades have enabled most persons with schizophrenia to live in the community. Nevertheless, the majority will continue to experience various symptoms and to have social and cognitive disabilities. With the development of new medications and psychosocial interventions, outpatient status can no longer be viewed as a satisfactory final outcome. This article presents the current state of schizophrenia therapeutics in a variety of clinically relevant situations: first-episode psychosis, treatment-resistant psychosis, chronic, relapsing psychosis, continuous poor functioning, and chronic psychosis not responsive to pharmacotherapy. The first-line atypical antipsychotics should generally be used, mainly because of their comparatively benign side-effect profiles, and they should be given as early as possible in the illness. The clinician should not be quick to accept persistent psychosis; the second-line atypical clozapine should be tried early in the course of the disease in patients showing treatment resistance. For patients residing with their families, educational and supportive family interventions have an important effect on relapse prevention; for those who live on their own and suffer frequent relapses, Assertive Community Treatment may be helpful. Patients with psychosis that is not responsive to pharmacotherapy may benefit from specific modalities of cognitive-behavioral therapy currently being developed, while persons with persistent negative symptoms and limited social competence may find social-skills training useful. In addition, new programs of supported employment may enable some patients to maintain competitive employment.",

Development of effective management strategies is hindered by confusing terminology.Research investigating treatments often use \"agitation\" or \"behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)\" as an outcome measure without differentiating the context in which these behaviors occurred.Actually, a recent review of 85 measures, used for assessing behavioral symptoms of dementia, found that \"no measures identify risk factors for behaviors or enable an evaluation of the context in which behaviors occur\". 1 At the same time, it is recognized that there is a need for identification of context in which behavior occurred for effective management as is described in the DICE approach. 2,3e most important context in which behavior occurs is presence or absence of another person.This context can distinguish two main types of behaviors: agitation and rejection of care. 4Agitation can be defined as \"behaviors that communicate to others [who observe the patient] that the patient is experiencing and unpleasant state of excitement and which remain after interventions to reduce internal or external stimuli have been carried out\". 5i.e., medical conditions, pain, medication side-effects, environmental factors, hunger or thirst, and others.Symptoms of agitation include general restlessness, repetitive mannerisms, pacing, trying to get to a different place, handling inappropriately, hiding things, inappropriate dressing and undressing and repetitive sentences. 6Agitation occurs when the person with dementia does not interact with others, i.e., is solitary.Rejection of care occurs in most cases when a caregiver tries to provide care for a person who does not understand the need for it, or misperceives the action as threatening, and resists caregiver's actions. 7If the caregiver insists to provide care, the person with dementia may defend himself/herself from unwanted attention, may become combative and develop reactive aggression.This reactive aggression can be defined as \"the repertoire of behaviors with which persons with dementia withstand of oppose the efforts of a caregiver\". 8and includes hitting, pushing, scratching, grabbing things or people, kicking and biting, screaming, cursing, temper outbursts, and making strange noises. 9",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairments in married people under the age of 60 are not common and have received little attention. Using a single case study and drawing on the author’s wide experience of counseling couples in this situation, this paper discusses some of the psychodynamic mechanisms that may come into play when multiple sclerosis (or any other neurological illness) threatens the cognitive capacities of one partner. Normal couple interactions, arising from attachment and affection and important for their maintenance, may be challenged. The author considers some of the problems associated with carers identifying with cognitively-deteriorating partners, including difficulties in thinking. Defenses against recognizing emotionally painful deficits contribute to frustration. Either partner’s lack of conscious awareness or acknowledgment of cognitive deficits and uncertainties as to the origin of troublesome behavior can also cause problems. Cognitive impairments impact on grieving and can give rise to a loss of an internal good object, as well as the loss of normal signals by which carers know they are loved. Also noted is the impact of cognitive problems on sexual relations and on relationships with children and with health professionals. The role of a counselor for a carer in this situation is discussed.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

Aggression is a complex behavior that is difficult to interpret, as it is often the result of biological and environmental interactions; therefore, internal and external stimuli may trigger the behavior. Within the context of psychiatric hospitals, aggression management often relies on the use of seclusion and restraint. The primary goal of the assessment was to identify the function of the aggression in order to develop a highly individualized treatment approach. Other methodology included an extensive review of the patient's history and treatment of psychiatric and medical conditions. Social skills training taught him how to establish eye contact, shake hands, and articulate simple requests rather than gesture or hit. Although aggression is often preceded by tangible behaviors such as anger, threats, and agitation, it should be noted that, in many cases, there are no clearly verbal or visible behavioral precursors.",

SAD often has been used as a diagnosis for individuals having an admixture of mood and psychotic symptoms whose diagnosis is uncertain. Its hallmark is the presence of symptoms of a major mood episode (either a depressive or manic episode) concurrent with symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech.A literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted to identify articles on SAD. We also reviewed major textbooks and DSM-5 to identify pertinent information.This review begins with the history and classification of SAD. Debate continues to swirl around the concept, as some experts view SAD as an independent disorder, while others see SAD as either a form of schizophrenia or a mood disorder. The disorder is more common in women and its course follows the middle ground between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. SAD appears to have high heritability. Most patients appear to benefit from antipsychotics plus antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers, depending on whether the patient has the depressive or bipolar subtype. Electroconvulsive therapy can also be effective.SAD is a chronic psychotic disorder that continues to be controversial. There has been inadequate research regarding its epidemiology, course, etiologic factors, and treatment.",

      "abstract": "For the clinician caring for patients in some phase of symptomatic HIV disease, patients' current level of adaptation and potential to sustain a sense of well-being are critical. Symptoms of anxiety and depression raise concern, and must be assessed for their severity and enduring qualities. Are these expressions evidence of moods that fluctuate over time even within a given day? Or are they reflective of full-blown syndromes enduring over time? Finally, are these reported and observable symptoms signs of current or imminent psychiatric disorders? Too frequently, episodes of anxiety and depression in persons with life-threatening illness are misdiagnosed where transient moods are given clinical relevance and syndromes are underestimated. Specificity in assessment is needed to derive the most appropriate intervention program. This problem in the context of primary care services to persons with HIV illness can lead to too much concern about temporary distress and minimization of moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression. People with AIDS (PWAs) must cope with multiple complications while anticipating a shortened lifespan. Emotional distress is common and may be organically based, idiopathic, and/or reactive. The relationship of somatic well-being and subjective emotional distress needs attention since the severity of physical debilitation and heightened risk of psychological problems seem to be correlated in this population. Predicting increased anxiety and dysphoric moods at crisis points in the illness draws attention to the role of individuals' cognitive appraisals of their symptoms, judgments of self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies. Symptom severity and perceived control over symptoms are interlocking phenomena capable of influencing emotional distress in these patients.",

      "abstract": "Patients with obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) often refer to a prompt mood improvement upon encountering good scents in general, or fresh laundry borax on their clothes, pillows or home settings. The Authors propose the new term psychic euosmia in the mean of an overstated psychological predisposition for a real pleasant smell that elicits an immediate sense of pleasure, order and calm. The prompt reactions to a pleasant odor might be explained by the involvement of rhinencephalon and its proximity to mood-related limbic circuits, which bypass the cognitive awareness. Cleanliness may not preclude a subject to enjoy a good smell, even if we are representing smells that resemble freshness, in other words order. A potentially even more important argument is given by the continuum of personality disorders and their variability. Not all personality characteristics led to disturbed behaviors. In evolutionary perspectives having the ability to differentiate between unpleasant and pleasant odors should have made the difference in surviving. On the other hand, psychic euosmia could be considered a normal reaction, but in our clinical experience it is over-represented among OCPD subjects with marked orderliness and disgust. Therefore, detecting psychic euosmia might vicariously confirm the relevance of disgust as a cognitive driver of OCPD. Hereby we support research to characterize psychic euosmia as a feature of orderliness and cleanliness for OCPD.",

      "abstract": "Relatives of 235 brain-injured (BI) patients were observed by trained (psychiatric) staff for psychological coping. This was practiced since 1984 in a BI-rehabilitation ward at a regional psychiatric hospital with 450 beds, serving a catchment area of 330,000. In semi-structured observations patterns of emotional behaviour were registered, which resemble those presented by Kübler-Ross for relatives of the dying. Nevertheless important differences were noted: 1. Unrealistic expectations on the relatives' side: caused by insufficient information on differences of physical and cerebral rehabilitation and unfounded belief, transfer from the intensive care section itself signifies the patient's restitution. 2. Unrealistic evaluations: individual consequences of BI may be underrated by relatives, more so if no additional injuries illustrate the patient's severe condition. 2.1. Coma--interpreted as \"pseudosleep\". Frequently the next of kin are uninformed on the aetiopathology or consequences of coma. Restitution of cerebral functions in various stages of impairment cause confusion, anxiety, resignation even rejection on the side of the relatives. 3. Personality changes: disruptions of personal traits or characteristics as outcome of severe BI are widely known and regarded as formidable consequence. 4. Fear of reintegration; therefore this fear is not infrequent in the next of kin. Additional factors caused by personal history or psychopathology may complicate the issue. Attitudes to rehabilitation are determined by psychological reactions of relatives and may be crucial for the outcome. Recognition of pathological traits and management of psychological attitudes ensures optimal effect of rehabilitation. We noticed several phases in the relatives' psychological changes: acute, initial, protracted and final stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Suicide attempts more often show characteristics of \"unsuccessful suicides\". Somewhat more frequent then in younger persons the suicide attempts are caused by depressive or schizophrenic psychosis. Nevertheless with the elderly the most frequent diagnoses are neurosis and depressive reaction. The elderly react depressive more often in relation to life events as conflicts with or loss of relatives or contracting a severe physical disease. Conclusions are drawn for a more adequate treatment of elderly suicidal patients with regard to their specific needs concerning psychological, physical and social problems.

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Unilateral neglect syndrome defined as failure to report, respond and orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented in contralesional side of space is cognitive impairment in neurological patients, important both from diagnostic and therapeutic point of view. It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data. Differential diagnostics is critical for planning an effective rehabilitation programme.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene. In addition to physical manifestations, complications such as cognitive and behavioral deficits have been described. CLINICAL FINDINGS: We describe a case of a 14-year-old male with a past psychiatric history of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and multiple suicide attempts, who presented with suicidal ideation and command hallucinations. The patient became aggressive, physically assaulting hospital staff, and required sedative medication and physical restraints for several days. He required inpatient hospital admission due to rhabdomyolysis. Throughout his admission, the patient was intermittently verbally and physically abusive to people around him. They described his outbursts as impulsive and thought to be out of motivation to get what he wants. He preferred to keep to himself and did not have relationships with people at his home. CONCLUSION: This case report provides insight into the behavioral characterization of children diagnosed with NF1. While the mechanism of how NF1 relates to behavioral issues is unknown, the association between NF1 and behavioral issues should be carefully considered in NF1 patients presenting with aggression.",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention. ADHD is chronic, may persist into adulthood, and is associated with impairment in social and academic/work domains across the lifespan. Children and adolescents with ADHD often present with executive function deficits and emotion dysregulation, and these deficits may increase impairment and risk for co-occurring disorders. The etiology of ADHD is not yet understood, though research suggests that biological and environmental factors (e.g., family, community) contribute to its development and course. It should be noted that ADHD commonly co-occurs with additional psychiatric disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), and major depressive disorder. Evidence-based assessment of ADHD requires information from multiple informants using multiple assessment methods to determine the presence of ADHD symptoms across settings and any co-occurring disorders. The evidence-based treatment options for ADHD are manifold. Pharmacotherapy for ADHD is common, although numerous behavioral interventions are also effective. Stimulant medications are commonly prescribed and are typically effective in ameliorating core ADHD symptoms. There is also evidence that the nonstimulant medication atomoxetine substantially decreases the symptoms of ADHD. Importantly, medication therapy works to reduce symptoms but typically does not alleviate the impairments associated with the disorder. Combined medication and behavioral interventions are more likely to reduce impairments and normalize behavior.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Capgras syndrome (CS) is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome characterized by the belief that a close relative has been replaced by an identical impostor. It is commonly associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. A 43-year-old married Asian female presented with a 5-year history of behavioural changes, including social withdrawal, suspiciousness, reduced self-care, and irrelevant speech. Her symptoms began following a familial conflict, leading to social isolation, self-neglect, and delusional misidentification, including Capgras syndrome, where she believed her mother had been replaced by an imposter. She later developed grandiose delusions, claiming to be a significant political figure. Despite initial improvement with antipsychotic treatment, she discontinued medication, resulting in symptom relapse and aggressive behaviour. Methods: Case report. Results: Capgras syndrome, first described in 1923, involves the delusional belief that familiar individuals have been replaced by impostors. It is often associated with psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative conditions. This case aligns with the dual-route model of face recognition, suggesting impaired implicit-affective processing alongside intact conscious recognition. The patient’s aggressive behaviour underscores the potential for violence in Capgras syndrome, highlighting the need for careful risk assessment and management. Non-adherence to treatment remains a significant challenge in managing such cases. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of early recognition and sustained treatment adherence in Capgras syndrome associated with schizophrenia to prevent deterioration and improve outcomes.",

      "title": "Insight in bipolar disorder",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Insight in bipolar disorder While the relationship between lack of insight in psychiatric disorders and anosognosia in neurological disorders has not been extensively studied, interest in examining psychiatric lack of insight has roots in advances in the understanding of the anosognosia. It is possible that both conditions share a common etiology in parietal and/or frontal lobe dysfunction, or they may represent two distinct entities with different etiologies, i.e., with predominance of brain dysfunction in anosognosia as opposed to the possible prominence of psychosocial factors in psychiatric lack of insight. While it has long been recognized that insight is impaired in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, the topic of insight in bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected. In mania, impairment of insight is about as severe as in schizophrenia and probably is associated with poor prognosis. The neuropsychological and/or psychosocial roots of lack of insight in mania remain unclear even if we recently reported that lack of insight might predict impaired decision-making in manic patients. In bipolar depression, impairment of insight is less severe than in mania; however, psychotic depression is associated with less insight than non-psychotic depression. There is some evidence that insight in depression may be less impaired when depressive symptoms are more severe, possibly supporting the depressive realism hypothesis. In remission, bipolar patients seem to recover insight. Thus, lack of insight in bipolar disorder appears to be a state-related phenomenon, unlike schizophrenia. Interest in studying clinical, neuropsychological and biological roots of insight in bipolar disorder, and their changes across different phases of illness, may improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying awareness of well-being in human.

      "title": "Optimizing Treatment of Schizophrenia <i>Enhancing Affective/Cognitive and Depressive Functioning</i>",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recognition and treatment of schizophrenia has largely focused on positive symptoms of the disorder, such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganization. However, other important symptoms, such as depression, cognition, and social functioning, have not received comparable attention. Fifty percent of schizophrenic patients suffer from comorbid depression, which is a major risk factor for suicide in this population, while 10% to 25% suffer from comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder. Cognitive deficits commonly observed in patients with schizophrenia include problems with concentration, attention, and memory, as well as problem-solving and verbal skills. These deficits are observed at early stages of the illness and can predict deficits in functional capabilities, such as occupational and social skills, educational attainment, and the ability to live independently. The severity of such impairments affects all patients in this population, including up to 10% of patients working full time and up to one third of those working part time. In light of the debilitating effects of depression, cognitive impairment, and other aspects of affective functioning on the quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, physicians need to partner with their patients to address these concerns and determine an appropriate treatment regimen. This can be done with simple functional-based cognitive questioning, the use of evidence-based psychosocial practices, and psychoeducation on the many pharmacotherapeutic options. It is recommended that depressive or suicidal symptoms of schizophrenia be treated with an antidepressant or mood stabilizer only if the symptoms have not subsided after treatment of the psychosis with an atypical antipsychotic. Additionally, relative to older medications, atypicals have demonstrated benefit in improving some of the cognitive impairments.",

      "title": "Psychosis following traumatic brain injury: A case study and a brief overview",
      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a relatively uncommon but potentially severe and disabling outcome. The complex relationship between TBI and the onset of psychosis is marked by significant scientific uncertainty and differing opinions. Objectives To investigate the occurrence of psychosis following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and explore the intricate relationship between TBI and the development of psychosis. Methods A comprehensive case report was conducted on a 38-year-old patient who, after a severe TBI at the age of 23, exhibited signs of psychosis. Developmental history, family background, clinical assessments, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) results were analyzed. Results The patient, at the time of writing aged 38, was born at full term with a regular presentation and uneventful delivery, with no indications of perinatal or obstetric complications. Developmentally, he reached all milestones within the expected range, and there were no significant premorbid characteristics. There was no family history of schizophrenia in a first- or second-degree relative; a paternal cousin had had psychosis-like symptoms, but reportedly remained well without any medication. At the age of 23, the patient was knocked from his motorcycle by a car and sustained a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), with initial loss of consciousness and was in a coma state for approximatively a month, with later sequelae of cerebellar syndrome and predominant right-sided pyramidal syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a year following the TBI showed sequelae of bifrontal and temporal contusion lesions. An EEG did not indicate any evidence of epilepsy, and a repeat EEG 14 years later revealed no diagnostic abnormality. A year after the accident, his surroundings have noticed social withdrawal, a turning inward with a religious fervor, and persecutory remarks focused on his brother. At the age of 26, he presented to a psychiatric service having auditory hallucinations. He was deluded, believing himself to be a prophesied redeemer figure who is expected to appear and bring justice and righteousness to the world. He had an inappropriate affect. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was made, and neuroleptics prescribed. His auditory hallucinations faded, but the subsequent course was of repeated episodes of florid psychosis requiring maintenance neuroleptic treatment, eventually haloperidol decanoate (150mg monthly). Conclusions Psychosis following TBI is an uncommon yet potentially severe consequence, carrying the risk of significant debilitation. The relationship between TBI and psychosis is complex, but notable distinctions exist in clinical, epidemiological, and neurobiological aspects when compared to primary psychotic disorders.

Processed food addiction (PFA) manifesting as obesity has been shown to be associated with failed educations, careers, and family management. As practitioners review the devastation of PFA through the assessment of SRAD Criterion 5, it may become apparent that it is unrealistic to expect a person with such a severe disease to be able to carry out obligations. It is especially important to assess the safety of children in the food addict's care. School can present a number of problems for the food addict. Dense cueing, stress, and negative interactions with classmates can combine to accelerate the disease and create barriers to success. Practitioners can reassure clients that they are not to blame by comparing PFA to any other serious illness or serious accident.",

      "abstract": "A syndrome of subcortical dementia has been described in conditions predominantly affecting the basal ganglia or thalamus, structures that have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. There are similarities between subcortical dementia and the type II syndrome of schizophrenia, in terms of clinical features, pattern of neuropsychological deficits, pathology, biochemistry and data from brain-imaging studies. These similarities raise the possibility that certain schizophrenic symptoms, particularly negative symptoms and disturbance of movement, may reflect subcortical pathology. Neuropsychological deficits of presumed frontal lobe origin have been reported in some schizophrenic subjects. The occurrence of such deficits in a condition in which frontal lobe pathology has not been clearly demonstrated may be explicable in terms of a subcortical deafferentation of the pre-frontal cortex.",

The longer an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) in school-aged children or adolescents persists, the greater the risk for long-lasting impairment in school, social or family domain. Looking at mood states and depressive syndromes from a psycho-pharmacological point of view shows remarkable differences, but also similarities between childhood/adolescence and adulthood. This chapter discusses these, providing an overview of the present state of pharmacological treatment of depressive syndromes in young people. Antidepressant medication in childhood and adolescence is indicated in cases of severe depressive symptomatology which are unresponsive to psycho-therapeutic interventions. For patients requiring pharmacotherapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the initial antidepressants of choice. Several psychopharmacological strategies are recommended for adults: optimization, augmentation or combination, and switching to the same or a different class of medications.",

      "abstract": "Addicts and alcoholics suffer vulnerabilities and deficits in self-regulation. A principal manifestation of their self-regulation disturbances is evident in the way they attempt to self-medicate painful affect states and related psychiatric problems. Individuals select a particular drug based on its ability to relieve or augment emotions unique to an individual which they cannot achieve or maintain on their own. Addicts and alcoholics usually experiment with all classes of drugs, but discover that a particular drug suits them best. Usually, painful affect states interact with other problems in self-regulation involving self-esteem, relationships, self-care, and related characterological defenses, making it more likely that addicts will experiment with and find the action of a particular drug appealing or compelling. Stimulants have their appeal because their energizing properties relieve distress associated with depression, hypomania, and hyperactivity; opiates are compelling because they mute and contain disorganizing affects of rage and aggression; and sedative hypnotics, including alcohol, permit the experience of affection, aggression, and closeness in individuals who are otherwise cut off from their feelings and relationships.",

How then, when an ill person is not really the carrier of disease in a causal-genetic sense? If he himself is only a 'symptom' of a much more widely encompassing disease unit that has grasped a social union like a family. Are we physicians and scientists in a position, as a consequence of our training, to see this possibility, or are such modes of thinking to be left to special medical fields like medical sociology? The isolated, sick person can show signs derived from a disturbed family relationship, particularly through psychosomatic disorders.

Comorbidity in this sense is clinically relevant. Comorbid cases are more severe, are more amenable to treatment and are more frequently suicidal. The level of association between psychiatric syndromes can lead to nosologic hypotheses that can be further examined by independent investigations, and especially by means of family studies. Generalized anxiety disorders are very closely associated with the affective disorders, particularly with depressions and suicide attempts, but also with hypomania. There is no close relationship with panic disorder. Social phobias are highly associated with agoraphobia, but also with simple phobia; also with panic, obsessive-compulsive syndromes and substance abuse. The prevalence of obsessive-compulsive syndromes depends to an exceptional degree on the definition. Syndromes below the diagnostic threshold of DSM-III are extremely frequent, and longitudinally a fluctuation about this threshold is apparent. OCS are especially found to be associated with social phobia and agoraphobia as well as with dysthymia and recurrent brief depression, but less with major depression.",

      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

Given the nature of onset and symptomatology, and the failure of prior therapies, the case was approached as a primary psychotic disorder.

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli.

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic health conditions and mental disorders affecting school-aged children. Prevalence with a conservative estimate is reported to be 3–5% of this population. Boys are approximately three-times more likely to be diagnosed than girls. The diagnosis refers to a family of related chronic neurobiological disorders that interfere with an individual's capacity to regulate activity level, inhibit behavior and attend to tasks in developmentally appropriate ways. Signs and symptoms of ADHD are typically present during the preschool period or in the early elementary school years, and the diagnosis requires that difficulties were present at or before age 7 years and create problems or impairment in at least two areas of the child's life (e.g., at school, on the playground, on the bus, at home or socially with peers). Stimulants are the first-line medication in the psychopharmacological treatment of ADHD. Between 10 and 30% of those affected with ADHD may not respond to stimulants or may not be able to tolerate associated side effects, such as appetite suppression, sleep disturbance, mood difficulties or exacerbation of comorbid tic disorders. In such instances, or when families are unwilling to consider a stimulant, nonstimulant medications may be appealing. Several nonstimulant medications that affect noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic pathways have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ADHD, although effect sizes are comparable with methylphenidate, fewer data have accumulated regarding the safety profile of nonstimulants in general. This review focuses on etiology, assessment and treatment of ADHD, in particular alternative treatment approaches with various nonstimulant agents, especially atomoxetine.",

      "abstract": "<sec> <title>UNSTRUCTURED</title> The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world and has had a long-term impact. The pandemic has caused great harm to society and caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Children are a vulnerable group in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises often cause children to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity, and exhaustion, and even raise the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The inclusion of psychosocial support for children and their families are part of the health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the biopsychosocial model, some children may have catastrophic thoughts and be prone to experience despair, numbness, flashbacks, and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or posttraumatic stress disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health, and remote interactive online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and behavioral health for children. Based on the psychological development characteristics of children, this study also illustrates interventions on the psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on children. Innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on children. Health care delivery and services should envision and implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and child health as the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term becomes a new reality. Future research on children's mental and behavioral health should pay more attention to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, and health informatics among many others. Digital approaches, health technologies, and informatics are supposed to be designed and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to children’s growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, augmented reality, and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological supporting service for children’s health; mobile technologies could be used to monitor children’s mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual privacy; big data and artificial intelligence could be used to support decision making on whether children should go out for physical activities and whether schools should be reopened. Implications to clinical practices, psychological therapeutic practices, and future research directions to address current effort gaps are highlighted in this study. </sec>",

      "title": "Alexithymia and Its Relationships to an Autistic Mode of Functioning",
      "abstract": "Many studies seem to display a link between alexithymia and troubles with empathy. Indeed, clinical studies have found a low level among some alexithymic subjects of recognition of facial expressions, limited facial mimicry when these subjects were put under experimental stress and difficulty in perceiving the emotions of others with a low level of emotional consciousness. Also, alexithymia was found in Asperger syndromes associated with empathy disorders. The difficulty of perceiving one’s own emotions should be referred at the very least to this other difficulty characterized by the incapacity to perceive the emotions in others and more generally to constitute a theory of the mental states of others. The idea of an ontogenetic relation between the alexithymic functioning mode and another functioning mode in the autistic realm of the self should be considered. In a metapsychological perspective, the author develops the idea that primary and secondary alexithymia could be integrated in the developmental continuum from the normal to the pathological by referring to an early malfunction during the phase of autosensuality on the model of the fixation-regression topography. Primary alexithymia could refer back to troubles of empathy whereas secondary alexithymia would refer to a defensive strategy aimed at protecting from traumatic affects. Because of fixations or microfixations during the autosensuality phase, autistic protection manœuvres could have created the setting, at an early stage, for alexithymic functioning with a certain distorsion in the ability to recognize one’s feelings and those of others. Alexithymic functioning would be linked to a heavy, early use of identification by dismantelment generating excessive recourse to (endo or extrapsychic) negative hallucination processes of the zones of emotional life which were either forclosed (primary anexithymia) or traumatic and not well elaborated (secondary alexithymia). This functioning mode would be present in any individual and would belong to the autistic level of the self. Its exclusive recourse would mark its pathological character with a risk of psychosomatic decompensation in the case of emotional excesses which could not be contained in the last resort by these autistic protection manœuvres.",

The disability may be unrecognized or denied by the sufferer and may attract social stigma rather than sympathy from others. The effect on mental health is surprisingly neglected. Early studies of psychiatric patients suggested hearing impairment is an important cause of paranoid illness, but more recent studies of wider populations have failed to confirm this association. Hearing impairment is unrelated to intellect when controlled for age, but is an important differential diagnosis of dementia in the elderly. Evidence accumulates to suggest that the hearing impaired are vulnerable to depression, social stress and isolation, but reliable controlled studies of psychiatric sequelae are needed.",

Objective: Carrying out an analysis of the life history of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia who, although voluntarily presenting at the hospital, does not recognize her diagnosis and treatment. It presents symptoms that include the delusional ideas of persecution or greatness. It has two possible admissions, currently admitted to the psychiatric department in Bucharest. Results: The patient presents disorders regarding perception, memory, affectivity, observing a disorganized discourse that includes a qualitative perceptual disorder, schizophrenia-specific hypoprosexias, disorders of the immediate mental synthesis with illusions of non-recognition, impossibility of evoking recent events, mental and ideation disorganization, the reversal of the affective, which generates conflicting emotional experiences. Conclusion: Although the patient is under treatment, insight is still not present, so patient supervision is recommended. The paranoid nucleus has diminished, but delusional ideas still persist, and the patient became affected during hospitalization.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Discontinuation syndromes have been noted for various classes of psychotropic medication and have now been observed for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new serotonergic antidepressants. REVIEW SUMMARY SSRIs and other new antidepressants are increasingly being used for neurologic disorders as well as for depression and anxiety, which frequently coexist with these illnesses. Recently, a discontinuation syndrome was identified after abrupt and even tapered withdrawal from these agents. The syndrome presents with somatic symptoms of disequilibrium, gastrointestinal symptoms, flu-like symptoms, disrupted sleep, and sensory disturbances as well as psychological symptoms of irritability, crying spells, and anxiety or agitation. These symptoms, which usually appear within 1 to 3 days after the last dose, are usually mild and transient but can be more severely distressing and debilitating and lead to disruption of social or occupational activities. When intervention is required, the primary strategy entails reinstituting the SSRI and, if appropriate, commencing a slow and gradual tapering schedule. We review the cases of three patients with SSRI discontinuation syndrome who presented to the clinic with neurologic complaints. CONCLUSION The primary prevention strategy for discontinuation syndrome is to avoid abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant medication, particularly for agents demonstrating a pharmacologic profile of a short half-life and no active metabolites. Awareness of SSRI discontinuation syndrome facilitates rapid identification and effective intervention as well as improved prevention through patient education. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:348-352, 2000)",

      "abstract": "The etiology of new psychotic symptoms in late life, including subtle changes in cognition, is a controversial emerging area of study. The development of psychotic symptoms, particularly paranoia, is a common occurrence in late life, and the symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and psychosis are often prominent in dementia, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. This intermixing of symptoms has inescapably led to diagnostic confusion with regard to elderly patients with new-onset psychosis. The complex relationship among different domains of psychopathology makes it difficult to tease apart disorders of affect from psychosis, affect from cognition, and psychosis from cognition. It is therefore potentially useful to modify and expand our approach to how we conceptualize these patients. Emerging evidence suggests that those with dementia, psychotic disorders, and mood disorders suffer from growing cognitive deficits. The article suggests that deficits in social cognition, in particular, may be the unifying deficit that helps to explain why heterogeneous patients may develop paranoia and psychotic symptoms in late life.",

IBS patients show an increased prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders, especially depression and anxiety. IBS is largely congruent with the concepts of somatoform and somatic symptom disorders. Roughly 50% of IBS patients complain of gastrointestinal symptoms only and have no psychiatric comorbidity. IBS concepts, treatment approaches, as well as health care structures should acknowledge its variability and multidimensionality by: (1) awareness of additional extraintestinal and psychobehavioral symptoms in patients with IBS; (2) general and collaborative care rather than specialist and separated care; and (3) implementation of \"interface disorders\" to abandon the dualistic classification of purely organic or purely mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Obsessions, compulsions, and stereotypes are common psychopathological manifestations of obsessive-compulsive, psychotic, and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). These nosological entities may be present in comorbidity, with relevant clinical difficulties in the differential diagnosis process. Moreover, ASDs are a complex group of disorders, with a childhood onset, which also persist into adulthood and present heterogeneous symptom patterns that could be confused with psychotic disorders.We report a case of a 21-year-old man characterized by sexual and doubt obsessions; disorganized, bizarre, and stereotyped behaviors and compulsions; and social withdrawal, inadequate social skills, visual dispersions, and hypersensitivity to light stimuli. Obsessive and compulsive features were initially included within the differential diagnosis of psychotic and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. However, aforementioned psychopathological elements did not improve when multiple antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, haloperidol, and lurasidone) were administered in the hypothesis of schizophrenia and even worsened with clozapine therapy at a dose of 100 mg/d. Obsessions and compulsions progressively reduced during the fluvoxamine 14-week treatment paradigm at a dose of 200 mg/d. Considering the persistent deficits in social communication and interactions as well as the restricted interests pattern, a differential diagnostic hypothesis of ASD was formulated, and it was then confirmed at the final evaluation at a third-level health care center.We discuss similarities and differences in the psychopathology of obsessions, compulsions, and stereotypes in the previously mentioned disorders, to underline factors that can help in the differential diagnosis of similar cases, and consequently in the appropriateness of treatment choice.",

As such, the optimal placement of ADHD in modern classification systems remains unclear. We advanced the literature by mapping ADHD symptoms onto three transdiagnostic psychopathology spectra – externalizing, neurodevelop-mental, and internalizing – and their symptoms. ADHD symptoms had varied associa-tions with different spectra, with subsets of symptoms relating most strongly to external-izing, others to neurodevelopmental, and still others to internalizing. Impulsivity, poor schoolwork, and low perseverance were most closely tied to externalizing, cognitive disengagement symptoms (e.g., confused, stared blankly, daydreamed) and immaturity were most closely tied to neurodevelopment, and cognitive disengagement symptoms were also tied to internalizing. Our findings advise against conceptualizing and treating ADHD as a unitary construct and against placing ADHD exclusively under either externalizing or neurodevelopmental spectra. Symptom-focused approaches will better inform modern psychopathology classification systems.",

This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease. These sources of diagnostic difficulty assume clinical importance when they delay the recognition of conditions that require urgent treatment.",

      "abstract": "Essential hypertension is a heterogenous disease made up of several still unspecified subgroups. According to the dual theory of hypertension, acquired and genetic factors can lead to vascular muscle defects and increased sympathetic drive, which, either both or each alone, can lead to an increased vascular resistance. Acquired factors can either help a predisposition to become a manifest disease, act by itself to cause a disease or prevent a genetic trait from becoming manifest. Among the acquired factors, we differentiate those lying inside the personality, which means they are early acquired in life and those lying outside of the individual such as job-stress, noise exposure etc. How the external stressors are perceived depends upon the personality make up and the social support system. Within the presented model the Greek word 'crisis' plays an important role, since it characterizes a state in which a decision has to be made. In a situation in which a decision cannot be made in reality or tried out in fantasy life, the organism will activate the autonomic nervous system in a planless fashion, alternating very rapidly between its two branches, with concomitant symptoms of trembling, piloerection, salivation, vomiting, urination, defecation etc. In case this persists for a longer period of time the reciprocity between the two systems may break down, the organism seems to be psychologically immobilized. In the beginning of stress exposure, increased sympathetic nervous system activity is seen as an adaptive response, thereby enabling the individual to cope, but if the attempts to cope meet with constant failure, the stress becomes unbearable. The attitude of giving up which then develops is accompanied by a low level functioning of the sympathetic nervous system. This goes along with an adaptation for the baroreceptor depressor mechanism. As a consequence, any kind of additional stress would not lead to a relieving counterregulation. This might be a small stone within the mosaic of essential hypertension.",

The mourning model is not sufficient to account for the type of difficulties, the particular mood and the lowered self-esteem so characteristic of depressive syndromes. The study of the psychological development of children helps us to sort out those situations which are of depressive type. However, not a single past incident during childhood can be clearly singled out as a causal factor of adult depression. Depressed adults as well as neurotics, psychotics, psychopaths or alcoholics have in common the fact that they have experienced early separation more often than control subjects. The attempts to isolate a particular aspect of the premorbid personality of depressed individuals are not at all conclusive. The notion of the typus-melancholicus (Tellenbach) has, however, the value of emphasizing the limiting character of these personalities: the need for a restricted perimeter of activity, limitations as concerns daily goals and painful sensitivity to change. The psychological reconstruction of depression can be done only after the event.",

Sexual dysfunction (SD) is frequent (40-74%) among women with multiple sclerosis (MS), reflecting neurological dysfunction, psychological factors, depression, side effects of medications and physical manifestations of the disease, such as fatigue and muscle weakness. A conceptual model for sexual problems in MS characterizes three levels. Primary SD includes impaired libido, lubrication, and orgasm. Secondary SD is composed of limiting sexual expressions due to physical manifestations. Tertiary SD results from psychological, emotional, social, and cultural aspects. Sexual problems cause distress and may affect the family bond. Practical suggestions on initiation of discussion of sexual issues for MS patients are included in this review. Assessment and treatment of sexual problems should combine medical and psychosexual approaches and begin early after MS diagnosis. Intervention can be done by recognizing sexual needs, educating and providing information, by letting patients express their difficulties and referring them to specialists and other information resources.",

Two types of long-term interaction between negative and positive symptoms could be distinguished: (1) relatively synchronized, and (2) relatively desynchronized. Synchronization of negative and positive symptoms is characterized by their unidirectional long-term course. Desynchronization is characterized by their bidirectional long-term relations: (1) negative schizophrenia with minimal positive symptoms at the beginning of the disease and further progression of negative symptoms; or (2) schizophrenia with negative symptoms ‘that stopped at the very beginning’, and the later course is characterized by positive symptoms. Considering every single time point of the long-term relationship between negative and positive symptoms (cross-sectionally), the chapter describes the concept of ‘mutual/common syndromes’ (consisting of both positive and negative symptoms) at different stages of schizophrenia, including residual deficit states.",

Back then, people-in-recovery were broadly categorized as either ‘neurotic’*, including what we now refer to as anxiety and depressive disorders, or ‘psychotic’*, including what we now refer to as bipolar disorder* and schizophrenia*. Therapists found that there was a group of clients who in many ways fitted into the ‘neurotic’ category except that they did not respond to the usual treatments at the time. The term ‘borderline’ referred to the belief at the time that this group of people were on the ‘border’ between neurotic and psychotic. While some people with BPD do have occasional psychotic or psychotic-like experiences, this definition of BPD being on the ‘border’ no longer applies; however, the term has become ingrained.",

Group psychotherapy is a treatment in which the therapist and group members with similar or the same experiences give feedback and exchange thoughts and experiences. Suicidality is an important psychopathological entity that trembles observed from different aspects due to its complexity and phenomenology.

      "title": "Exploring the Trauma Experiences of Homeless Families: A Literature Synthesis",
      "abstract": "“Trauma” comes from the Greek word meaning “wound” as in a physical injury to the body. Only in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did trauma take on the psychological connotations we attach to the word today. From experiences of trauma resulting from a single event to complex trauma resulting from extended, repeated traumatic events, the effects of trauma can be long-lasting and negatively affect both mental and physical health. \r\n\r\nFamilies experiencing homelessness constitute 33% of the total homeless population. Homelessness itself presents numerous challenges, but many families also struggle to cope with problems that preceded homelessness and/or that may compound it. This literature synthesis explores trauma in the lives of homeless families. The findings suggest that the trauma histories of homeless families are quite extensive and include abuse and neglect as children as well as intimate partner violence in adulthood. Children in homeless families often witness abuse suffered by their caregivers. In terms of the impact of trauma, depression, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other psychiatric disorders are not uncommon among homeless mothers. Children are similarly negatively affected. They may experience internalizing and/or externalizing problems. Internalizing problems include depression, anxiety, and PTSD whereas externalizing problems include aggression and other behavioral problems.\r\n\r\nThere are many interventions designed to help members of families who have experienced traumatic events. However, homeless families may not be able to take advantage of such offerings because of housing instability. While it is certainly important for homeless families to eventually receive trauma-related interventions, what can be done at the point of homelessness? One option is for providers of services to the homeless to follow trauma-informed practices, which are outlined as part of this literature synthesis.\r\n\r\nHomelessness in and of itself is a significant public health problem. For example, homelessness is associated with physical and mental health problems and barriers to accessing care. With respect to trauma and homelessness, the severity of trauma symptoms is predictive of long-term housing instability for families. Thus, it is important to address trauma among homeless families to help keep them out of shelters and other unstable living situations.",

Epistemologically anomie can be identified as an intervening variable mediating between independent and dependent clusters of variables. Anomie is not the same as political action in general, and not the same as misery or poverty, or the whole repertory of social problems. But it may cause some of these problems as a factor accompanying any major transition. An early warning system with a dangerously high level of anomie would include low level of faith in the system that was, low level of faith in the new system, high level of egoistic cost-benefit analysis, including violence, corruption, apathy, drug consumption, the inner journey, maybe suicide.",

Such factors include, but are not limited to, female gender, social disadvantage, childhood adver sity, genetic predisposition, and substance abuse. PTSD has a high rate of comorbidity with psychiatric, substance abuse, and somatization disorders. Persons with PTSD experience profound and persistent alterations in their physiological reactivity to internal and external stimuli which prevents them from utilizing their emotions to process incoming information. These patients have chronically high levels of sympathetic nervous system activity and low levels of glucocorticoids to cope with stress and modulate their catecholamine levels. Neuropsychological assessment of patients with PTSD depends to a large degree on the sensitivity of the measures which are utilized and a pre-existing history of learning disabilities, head trauma, and/or neurological disorders. While closed head injuries (CHI) are unlikely to produce PTSD symptoms, persons with CHI are likely to develop PTSD symptoms if they are exposed to trauma prior to the onset of retrograde amnesia or after the resolution of post-traumatic amnesia. If the traumatic event occurs while the patient with CHI is amnestic or unconscious, they are unlikely to develop PTSD symptoms. The liberal criteria used to diagnose mild CHI is likely to result in patients with acute stress disorders being misdiagnosed with CHI as a result of their dissociative symptoms which reduce their awareness and encoding of the traumatic event.",

Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Personal assistance for children and adolescents (0‐18) with intellectual impairments",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to impairment as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular activities as a result of impairments, and a person's participation in education, social life, work, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (WHO 2003). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms disability or handicap. This review will include children and adolescents with intellectual impairments, which include learning impairments (e.g., Down's syndrome, global developmental delay, or pervasive developmental disorder), learning disability (also called ‘intellectual disability’ or ‘mental retardation’) and acquired brain injuries. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently; interventions would aim to achieve different outcomes. Therefore, young people with physical impairments or both physical impairments and intellectual impairments will be considered in other Cochrane and Campbell reviews, as will working-age adults and older adults. Around the world, about six hundred million people have impairments (UN 1990), most of whom live in the developing world. Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (UN 1990) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates. The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have ‘profound’ impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (Hogan 1997). Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (Alberman 1991; Allen 1993; Doyle 1995). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (Middle 1996; Williamson 1983; Wilson-Costello 2005). Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by (Hogan 1997)). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (Hogan 1997). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (Newacheck 2004) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (Newacheck 2004; UN 1990). Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (Hogan 1997). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (Wenger 1995). As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings. A discourse of disability ethics has evolved to discuss concepts of independence, defined not as people with disabilities “doing everything” for themselves, but as having maximum control over how help is provided (Morris 2001). Proponents of the social model of disability regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (Abberley 1987; Oliver 1990). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., allowing sufficient time between activities for children with impairments to toilet), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem. Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (Hammal 2004; Mihaylov 2004). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (Hogan 1997). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (Neely-Barnes 2004; Pit-Ten 2002; Varni 2005). Limited participation in activities may have negative impacts on the mental and physical functioning of children and adolescents and may lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Children and adolescents with intellectual impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (Witt 2001). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (Moss 2000). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (Rossiter 2001; Sharpe 2002; Thyen 1998). Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments (Newacheck 2004). However, children and adolescents with impairments require varying degrees of support. For example, in one large study, ‘those in the upper decile of the expenditure distribution accounted for 65% of all charges’. Costs born by families of children and adolescents with the most severe impairments were similarly high; out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (i.e. those not reimbursed by insurance or a health service) for the top 10% of the distribution accounted for 85% of all out of pocket expenses (Newacheck 2004). All children and adolescents require some level of care. However, children and adolescents with severe impairments may require many hours of assistance every day in addition to the normal assistance required by their peers. Consequently, family members (notably mothers) may withdraw from work and social life. Caring for a child with severe impairments can put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (Neely-Barnes 2004; Witt 2001). In the U.S., parents of children with impairments are less likely to have attended college and more likely to be single and poor (Hogan 1997). The stress of caring for children with impairments may have negative impacts on parents, but some problems associated with impairments may increase the risk of impairment. For example, poor children are less likely than their peers to receive preventive healthcare (Newacheck 1988) and depressed mothers are less likely than other mothers to use injury prevention strategies like car seats and electrical plug covers (McLennan 2000). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the development of intellectual impairments is affected by sociodemographic factors (Resnick 1998). Low birthweight black babies are more likely than white babies to survive (Morse 2006), which might affect the relative prevalence of impairments in different racial groups; however, ‘controlling for socioeconomic differences and family structure, black children are no more at risk of functional limitation than whites’ (Hogan 1997). Since the causes and consequences of impairments are often difficult to disentangle, retrospective studies are difficult to interpret. Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, and health of children and adolescents. There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with intellectual impairments. For example, social activities may be designed such that children and adolescents with intellectual impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (Colver 2005). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Skills training, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities. Personal assistance is support given to children and adolescents with impairments living in normal housing (e.g. family homes or school accommodation) to enable them to participate in mainstream activities in various settings. Personal assistance is directed by users and their representatives and is designed to promote independence and to reduce strain on families. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance is provided by non-professionals; it may aim to improve health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance may be purchased by governments, insurance providers, or individuals. It may be provided directly or indirectly through payments or vouchers. Personal assistance differs from voluntary or charitable services over which users do not have the same control. It also differs from respite care, which is temporary and aims to help carers rather than individuals with impairments. Personal assistance is designed for people whose participation in many normal activities would be impossible without help. While user needs should be assessed periodically, personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments. For example, the needs of a person with a recently acquired impairment might be different from the needs of a person who has had an impairment from birth and the needs of both might change; personal assistance would be designed to meet their unique needs and would develop with them. In this way, it differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time. Receipt of personal assistance is dependent on the amount of help required by an individual. For example, personal assistance in Nordic countries is generally provided to people requiring at least 20 hours of help per week, though most users have severe impairments and both require and receive substantially more assistance. Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, and the U.S. Services in different countries for different users are called by different names, which often relate to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Eligibility varies around the world. For example, countries that see services for adults as a ‘right’ may not be able or willing to provide comprehensive services for children and older adults. Services for people of different ages may be provided through different mechanisms. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Differences in eligibility affect the number and types of people who receive support and these differences affect the amount and types of support individuals and their families receive. That is, the relative number of people receiving personal assistance and their characteristics vary across countries, insurance schemes, etc. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. Assistants may increase social participation for many people, but having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users’ need for privacy, or with parents’ own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children. Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments (e.g., children, older adults, people with intellectual impairments, and people in rural areas) may prefer other services, particularly since these groups may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000). While many personal assistants are managed by users or their representatives, the nature of personal assistance can make it difficult to separate the roles that individuals play in supporting people with impairments. For example, Askheim identified one mother of a child with intellectual impairments in Norway who acted both as the manager of her child's payments and as a full-time personal assistant (Askheim 2003). Policies that permit different care arrangements may have substantially different impacts. As the personal assistance movement gained strength, Ratzka noted that ‘there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures’ (Ratzka 1986). Some research now suggests that personal assistance may meet otherwise unmet needs of people with impairments. Shortly after its introduction, a survey of direct payment recipients in the UK found that 40% had a need for additional hours of personal service while 80% of people receiving other services had a similar need (Zarb 1994). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (Socialstyrelsen 2005). To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to ‘no-intervention’ (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes. Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and participate in normal activities due to permanent intellectual impairments. Young people living outside their own homes (e.g., in private or public institutions for people with impairments) will be excluded. Children and adolescents with physical impairments will be excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. Personal assistance is paid individualised human support that is designed to promote participation of people with permanent impairments. In consultation with experts and the reference group, the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance would could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. For inclusion in this review, personal assistance must have been delivered for at least 20 hours per week. Comparisons might include, either singly or in combination, family care, institutionalisation, on-demand services, escort services and other alternatives to personal assistance. ‘No-treatment’ and ‘waiting list’ groups will be included even if other services received are no described. These will be treated as separate comparisons. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) will be included in the review, though these comparisons will be discussed separately as the outcomes from such studies would not indicate the effectiveness of personal assistance relative to other interventions. Primary outcomes will include: 1) Global quality of life, both (a) generic measures (e.g., the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; [Varni 2005]) and (b) specific measures designed for children with particular impairments. Though well-validated measures for the general population will be considered, a review of global health measures found that ‘very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents’ (Riemsma 2001). 2) User satisfaction. Direct reports will be preferred, though proxies might be used if users are unable to communicate. 3) Participation, including social activities, ability to participate in spontaneous activities, time outside the home, and mobility. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) Unmet needs, particularly the inability to perform activities of daily living. 2) Developmental outcomes, including cognitive milestones and acquisition of skills. 3) Health outcomes, including direct measures of muscle strength, disease, injuries, abuse or pain and indirect measures such as nutrition, emergency room visits or need for hospitalisation or institutionalisation. 4) Psychiatric outcomes, including self-harm, pica (eating non-food substances), and outwardly directed challenging behaviour. Measures might include items from the externalising scale of the Behavior Problem Inventory (Sturmey 1993). 5) Impact on others, including parental (maternal) employment, satisfaction, and quality of family life. For example, measures might include the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; (Ware 1992) or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; (Counsell 1994). 6) Direct and indirect costs, both immediate and long-term. To account for normal development and the changing impacts of impairments, outcomes will be grouped by length of follow-up (e.g., 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years). The organisation of services is often a complicated task and new users or their representatives must train personal assistants. Outcomes measured during the first year of receiving personal assistance will be considered apart from outcomes measured after one or more years to account for this adjustment period, which may not be representative of personal assistance as a whole. As we anticipate many relevant documents will be unpublished, a three-part search strategy will be undertaken in order to maximise chances of capturing all relevant literature. Databases will be searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches will be limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believe it is extremely unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980. No language restrictions will be imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases will be searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) will be searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases will be searched in appropriate languages. No filters based on methodology will be applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies. The authors worked with a reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (Jackson 2005) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that will likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers). The following databases will be searched electronically: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) MEDLINE CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) EMBASE LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index & Abstracts) BIDS (International Bibliography of the Social Sciences [IBSS] on Bath Information and Data Services [BIDS]) C2-SPECTR (The Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register) Dissertations Abstracts A (Dissertation Abstracts International A: The Humanities and Social Sciences) EconLit ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) PsycINFO Sociological Abstracts SIGLE search (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) Artikelsök DIVA Handicat Hicat LIBRIS LIBRIS Uppsök SveMed+ Danbib Medline will be searched using the following terms: 1 Home Care Services/ 2 Activities of Daily Living/ 3 Personal Health Services/ 4 (personal adj2 assist$).mp.

These approaches and any replies will be documented by the authors. Additionally, impairment-oriented email lists (list-servs) will be sent a letter requesting assistance in locating studies. The reviewers will contact authors of all included and excluded studies to request details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Reference lists from previous reviews and from all included and excluded studies will be searched. Relevant websites, including those maintained by users, governments, other agencies, and academics will be searched. From the resultant list of articles, outcome evaluations about people with impairments will be identified through electronic and hand searches. Two authors (EMW and PM) will check titles for relevance. When a title appears potentially relevant, both authors will examine the abstract. If one author feels an abstract might be relevant, the full article will be obtained. Two authors will examine the remaining papers to determine eligibility. Study authors will be contacted if further information could resolve initial disagreements about inclusion. Remaining disagreements will be discussed with the third reviewer (JD). If a consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinating Editor of the CDPLPG will be consulted. A flowchart of the process of trial selection will be made in accordance with the QUORUM statement (Moher 1999). Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM) using a specially developed data extraction form. When more than two treatment arms are included in the same trial, all arms will be described. The following data will be collected for all trial arms: 1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, social and economic status); 2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability); 3) Other interventions received; 4) Outcome measures listed above. The following data will be collected for all studies: 1) Programme differentiation (Dane 1998; MRC 2000), including crossover between groups and the differences between the interventions received; and 2) Context. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) where: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number) (D) random allocation not used. Studies in all quality categories will be considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses. Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (Deeks 2003). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants will be described in the description of studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline. Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews (Moher 1995). At present, evidence indicates that ‘scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually’ (Juni 2001). The following components will be considered in the description of studies: 1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?); 2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?); 3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?); 4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?); 5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (Delgado 2004; Juni 2001); and 6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?). All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison or inclusion in a meta-analysis, the most intense service or the service that best follows the goals of personal assistance (e.g., services that give users more control) will be included in the meta-analysis. If a single eligible intervention group is compared to multiple eligible control groups, ‘no-treatment’ controls will be chosen over other groups for comparison and inclusion in meta-analyses. For studies that do not have no-treatment condition, the most common intervention in clinical practice will be chosen to maximise the external validity of the results. When a single study provides multiple measures of the same outcome, we will report all measures. For example, if a study includes two measures of quality of life (either measures completed by the same respondent or measures completed by different respondents), we will report both of them. If measures of an outcome are combined for meta-analysis, we will conduct multiple meta-analyses if multiple studies report multiple measures that can be combined in this way. If we conduct meta-analyses in which only one effect estimate can be used from each study, we will select one measure if it is more valid or reliable than the others. For example, if a single respondent completes both a validated scale assessing multiple domains of quality of life and an unvalidated visual analogue scale, we will select the validated scale. If a study includes several equally valid measures and only one effect estimate can be used for meta-analysis, we will calculate the average effect for this purpose (e.g. the average SMD or RR weighted by variance). When necessary, the corresponding author will be contacted to supply any unreported data (e.g., group means and standard deviations (SDs), details of dropouts, and details of interventions received by the control group). Other authors will be contacted if necessary. If a study reports outcomes only for participants completing the trial or only for participants who followed the protocol, authors will be contacted and asked to provide additional information to permit an intention-to-treat analyses. RevMan 4.2 will be used to perform the following calculations. Within studies, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated for comparisons of dichotomous outcome measures. Mean differences, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs will be calculated for comparisons of continuous outcome measures. Meta-analyses may be conducted to combine comparable outcome measures across studies. All overall effects will be calculated using inverse variance methods. Random-effects models will be used because studies may include somewhat different treatments or populations. Dichotomous outcome measures may be combined by calculating an overall RR and 95% CI. Continuous outcome measures may be combined when means and standard deviations or complete significance testing statistics are available, unless statistical tests assuming normality would be inappropriate. For example, for scales beginning with a finite number (such as 0), effect estimates will not be combined unless a mean is greater than its standard deviation (otherwise the mean would be very unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution). If continuous outcomes are measured identically across studies, an overall weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI may be calculated. If the same continuous outcome is measured differently across studies, an overall standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI may be calculated (Higgins 2005). SMDs will be calculated using Hedges g. Studies in which participants are analysed as members of the groups to which they were originally assigned (intention-to-treat analysis), studies that include only those participants who were willing or able to provide data (available-case analysis), and studies that analyse participants who adhered to the study's design (per-protocol analysis; (Higgins 2005) will be analysed separately. Studies in which the reasons for excluding participants from analyses can not be determined from relevant reports or through contact with the authors will be considered with per-protocol analyses. The consistency of results will be assessed using the I2 statistic (Higgins 2002; Higgins 2003). If there is evidence of heterogeneity (Q-statistic p less than or equal to 0.1 coupled with an I2 value of 25% or greater), the authors will consider sources according to pre-specified subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses (below) but will not report an overall estimate of effect size. If heterogeneity remains within these subgroups, the review will report the results on a trial-by-trial basis, in a narrative summary. Large numbers of subgroups may lead to misleading conclusions and are best kept to a minimum (Counsell 1994; Oxman 1992; Yusuf 1991). If possible, this review will include separate effect estimates for the following subgroups: 1) Organisation of services Personal assistance organised by user representatives (e.g., through direct payment schemes) will be considered apart from personal assistance organised and managed by others (e.g., social workers or government agencies). 2) Acquisition of impairment Separate effects will be reported for children and adolescents who had impairments from birth, who have long-standing impairments, and who recently acquired impairments. 3) Amount of assistance The number of hours of assistance received per week is related to user needs, which are determined by social context, the availability of other services, severity of impairments, etc. Separate effect estimates will be reported for users receiving different levels of assistance (e.g., 20-50 hours, 51-80 hours, more than 80 hours). Sensitivity analyses will investigate the influence of lower quality studies (i.e., those rated C and D on allocation concealment) on the results of the review. To investigate the possibility of bias, including publication bias, funnel plots will be drawn (Deeks 2005; Egger 1997; Sterne 2001). In the event of asymmetry, the reviewers will seek input from methodologists, including the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Methods Groups, on appropriate analyses. When meta-analyses are performed, data will be entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for personal assistance.

Mild mental retardation, the most common and serious deficit, and a variety of other anomalies may accompany fetal alcohol syndrome. Sensory deficits include optic nerve hypoplasia, poor visual acuity, hearing loss, and receptive and expressive language delays. Atrial and ventricular septal defects, as well as renal hypoplasia, bladder diverticula and other genitourinary tract abnormalities, may occur.

Neurocardiogenic syncope is the most common type of syncope in children with an incidence of 70%. It usually has a benign etiology, with rapid loss of consciousness and spontaneous resolution. In case of neurocardiogenic syncope, it is important to assess the emotional and/or adaptive capacity of the patient. From a psychological point of view, the presence of a traumatic area of development has been reported in pediatric patients with syncope. This area is characterized by symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, self-withdrawal, somatic complaints and dissociation. Neurocardiogenic syncope in pediatric age can be the expression of a psychosomatic disorder underlying psychopathological vulnerability.",

PCS is controversial insofar as it has been attributed to emotional reactions, physiological responses, symptom exaggeration, secondary gain, attentional disorder, dysfunction of informational processing and mental speed, diffuse axonal injury, cranial nerve injury, emotional reaction to being injured, and so forth. The site of noncerebral trauma has been described by the Abbreviated Injury Scale as head or neck, face, chest, abdomen or pelvic contents, extremities or pelvic girdle, external. Neurobehavioral and adaptive dysfunctions after an accident are diverse and complex. There are characteristic sensorimotor and cognitive symptoms, for example, dizziness, visual and balance symptoms. The spectrum of injuries caused by a concussive event creates adaptive difficulties in coping with the social and physical environments.",

      "title": "Application of the PRECEDE Model to Understanding Postnatal Depression.",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Fourth Edition (SM-IV-TR) postnatal depression (PND) is not currently recognized as a separate diagnosis. Instead, the DSM-IV-TR recognizes mood problems during the postnatal period using a postnatal onset specifier to several mood disorders including, major depressive, manic or mixed episode of major depressive disorder, bipolar i disorder, bipolar ii disorder and brief psychotic disorder (1).Postnatal depression, that is depression occurs in a mother within 6 weeks of her giving birth, can have profound effects upon the health and wellbeing of the mother, her baby and the family (2) characterized by a number of symptoms including core symptoms of depressed mood and/or loss of pleasure, together with additional symptoms, including changes in weight or sleep, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worth lessens or guiltiness, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation (3). Therefore, PND is a multifactorial disorder with biological, psychological, and sociological aspects interacting with woman's risk individually. In addition to the considerable negative personal impact that PND has on women, PND also negatively affects marital relationships (1). Mothers are fully active in their role, when they feel healthy, and the society considers them healthy. While, PND can be explained by clinical criteria and physical symptoms, social recognition is also effective in this area.PND may also detrimentally affect mother-infant attachment, and infant social and cognitive development. Depressed mothers are less emotionally sensitive and less attuned to their infant's emotional state. These serious implications make PND an important mental illness to study because of the tremendous impact it has on the mother and support system, including child's development and familial relationships (1). The ability of a woman to adjust to these changes affects herself, her infant, other children she may have, and her partner (3). Healthy People 2010 listed improve-ement of the health and well-being of women, infants, children, and families as goal (3).The first step in designing an educational program is selecting a health education model which starts the program on the right way and guides it to the evaluation phase. One of the frequently used models in health education and promotion is the PRECEDE model. We assessed the effectiveness of application of PRECEDE model on pregnant women for preventing PND. We hypothesized that predisposing, enabling and reinforcing would serve as antecedents to postnatal depression. Identifying preventive factors is considered an important step in treatment of PND. Predisposing factors, enabling and reinforcing factors are presented as underlying factors in PRECEDE model and addressing each of these factors by the individual and society plays an important role in prevention of this disorder.Therefore, this study investigated predisposing, enabling and reinforcing as factors that can prevent postnatal depression.The PRECEDE model has been widely applied in health promotion settings. Its main goals are to explain health-related behaviors and to guide the design of interventions that aim to change healthrelated behaviors, their antecedents, and their sequelae (4). The PRECEDE framework attempts to identify a type of education which results in certain changes and eventually leads to Prevented PND. The PRECEDE portion of the model (Phases 1-4) includes social, epidemiological, behavioral, environmental, educational, adminis-trative, and policy assessments. Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling, Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) model has been developed by Green and Kreuter as a theoretical model to identify the needs of educational programs and health promotion (5). …",

      "title": "The Boundaries Between Normality, ADHD and PBD in Child Psychiatric Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is considered one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood. Clinical descriptions and diagnostic criteria for ADHD have been redefined over time; current conceptualization of the syndrome is characterized by lack of attention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. Epidemiological studies show large differences in the incidence, indicating that the effort of current taxonomic systems to offer diagnostic accuracy have not yielded substantial results. Bipolar Disorder (BD) with onset in childhood, commonly referred as Pediatric Bipolar Disorder (PBD), is distinguished from the adult type by the rarity of affective symptoms. Neither depressive mood nor hypomanic euphoria is apparent in the clinical picture of bipolar children and adolescents. Instead they exhibit a severe irritability and their symptoms are expressed in consecutive cycles, which include brief episodes of depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed periods without free intervals. There has been a delay in the recognition of this clinical picture. Nevertheless, the diagnostic criteria in the current taxonomic systems are not separated from those of adults. The contemporary literature contemplates the relationship between ADHD and PBD. These two disorders share similar clinical picture with slight variations, thus the differential diagnosis in favour of PBD mainly based on the presence of affective disorders in the family. In this paper, we try to examine whether comorbidity exists, whether ADHD is over-diagnosed against PBD or whether ADHD represents a prodromal manifestation of PBD. Children with ADHD-PBD comorbidity tend to express mostly an irritable phenotype with a chronic course and have higher rates of conduct disorders. This suggests a symptomatic continuum spectrum between ADHD and PBD which is possibly responsible for the difficulties met in differential diagnosis and the variation of comorbidity rates. It seems that the earlier the onset of PBD more often it is associated with symptoms of ADHD. The relationship between PBD and ADHD has important implications for treatment. The diagnostic confusion regarding the evaluation and relationship of these two clinical entities is strongly reflected in the proposed course of pharmaceutical treatment. The diagnostic issues concerning the diagnosis of ADHD versus PBD and their entangled relationship refer to the difficulty of defining the limits of normal and abnormal in the mental health of children and adolescents and the limitation of the taxonomic systems in respect to the particularities of this developmental age spectrum.",

      "title": "[Current and emerging features of obsessive-compulsive disorder--trends for the revision of DSM-5].",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized as significant impairment of cognitive-behavioral inhibition, which is causally associated with cognitive processes evoking anxiety, along with increased desire for perfect control over the possible harm, at least in typical OCD patients who have compulsions in response to obsessions. However, OCD has been well conceptualized as a multidimensional and heterogeneous disorder apparently comprising a number of potentially valid subtypes. For example, OCD can be diagnosed by either obsessions or compulsions, and a certain type of OCD patient has only compulsions in response to rules that must be applied rigidly. They often become stuck as a result of rigid rules in every step of their daily working and social life. This type of compulsive behavior is often triggered by specific sensory phenomena such as sight, touch, or personal expression (e. g. need to express himself precisely in written or spoken words). Thus, such OCD patients usually perform their compulsions in order to relieve sensory phenomena such as feelings of incompleteness and urges to reach a specific sensation of feeling \"just right\", and are less likely to have obsessions or cognitive processes preceding the repetitive behaviors. This type of OCD has also been characterized as \"tic-related\" and tends to have comorbid conditions such as tic disorders, ADHD or skin picking. Indeed, there are some crucial and significant differences in the psychopathology, phenomenology, and putative biological bases between OCD patients with obsession-related compulsions (cognitive type) and those with compulsions repeated according to rigid rules (motoric type). Because of the substantial heterogeneity of OCD, it seems to be beyond the traditional learning model in which anxiety-driven obsessions entrain neutralizing compulsions and also beyond the essential features of anxiety disorders commonly characterized by psychopathological characteristics such as marked and persistent fear, expectant anxiety, fear conditioning, avoidance, and cognitive process to evoke anxiety et al. Eventually, it has caused dramatic changes of view on the core psychopathology of OCD that is based on \"preoccupation\" and \"repeated behaviors\" as a failure of behavioral (cognitive and motor) inhibition, which also constitutes a key characteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) in process of the revision of DSM-5. The precise nature and compass of this spectrum remains to be fully elucidated, but a preliminary approach emphasizes that putative OCRDs have phenomenological (e.g. repetitive thoughts or behaviors), etiological, psychobiological or treatment overlap with OCD, differentiating OCD from other anxiety disorders. Therefore, OCRDs, including OCD, may be classified apart from other anxiety disorders in the revisions of DSM-5 or ICD-11. Nevertheless, recent neuroimaging evidence points to the critical involvement of the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdalo cortical circuitry, in addition to cortico-striatal circuitry, in the pathophysiology of OCD, suggesting the possibility that fear extinction, in addition to behavioral inhibition, might be impaired in OCD similarly to other anxiety disorders. Moreover, studies have investigated the relevant neurocircuitry, neurochemistry, and neuroendocrinology commonly underlying depression, anxiety disorders and OCRDs, and have explored the underlying genetic basis of and relevant intermediate phenotypes for developing these conditions. Thus more research is needed to elucidate the essential relationships among these disorders and to validate the future diagnostic classifications of anxiety disorders.",

Depression is common, and onset of illness tends to occur early in adulthood, contributing to its burden of illness. Risk factors for depression include early childhood adversity, low socioeconomic status, psychosocial stressors, and the presence of certain medical and psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of depression can be challenging, and the diagnosis relies of establishing the presence of a collection of characteristic symptoms and illness course. The illness is highly co-morbid with both other psychiatric illnesses as well as with non-psychiatric medical conditions. Emerging approaches to the diagnosis of depression consider dimensional approaches, as well as the role of objective biological and behavioural aspects of the illness, in diagnosis and in the identification of potential subtypes of the disorder.",

Depression is observed in all age groups from childhood to senescence, and its lifetime prevalence exceeds 10% and that among women is 1.3 to 1.7 times higher than that among men. Its prevalence in old age so far reported is generally low. The premorbid characters of depression known in Japan and Germany are Kretschmer's cycloid, Tellenbach's melancholic and manic types, and Shimoda's immodithymia. Recently, Ihda pro- posed the structural theory for immodithymic character. The diagnostics of depres- sive episodes (ICD-10) and the relationship between culture and depressive symp- toms are discussed. Depression in non-European cultures as reported previously rarely manifested self-blame or suicidal ideas, and depressive symptoms were not severe. In Japan, there have been reports of withdrawal depression where the patient tries to escape from his/her studies or work without much self-guilt. At least some of the depressive symptoms are culturally defined, and the diversified clinical pictures of depression may reflect the cultural and social situations of the contem- porary time.",

In this article we situate the term within the current affective nomenclature and human emotional experience, explore its psychophysiological features, and place it within the context of psychopathology.

      "abstract": "Late-life depression is highly heterogeneous in clinical presentation, and is also commonly resistant to treatment. While some cases are a continuation of the chronic course of illness beginning in early adulthood, a large number of persons will have a first episode of depression in later life following alife-time of relatively good mental health. While incident cases of major depression tend to decrease with age, the number of persons with clinically significant depressive symptomatology rises. À distinction has often been made between early-onset and late-onset depression, however, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest these are distinct clinical entities. On the other hand observations from a fifteen year prospective population study of psychiatric disorder in the elderly (the ESPRIT Study) supports the alternative idea that depression may be divided into sub-types according to postulated aetiology; for example depression with a strong genetic component, related to hormonal changes, the consequence of trauma; the result of cerebrovascular insult. Exposure to these putative causes may be more common at different points in the life span, thus suggesting age-differences. Our research further suggests that even cases of depression appearing for the first time in late-life, may be initially triggered by risk factors occurring decades before. Our findings suggest, for example, that childhood events may lead to changes in the biology of stress management, which continue throughout life, increasing vulnerability to depression and persisting even after effective treatment of symptoms. Together these observations suggest it may be more meaningful to classify depression in the elderly according to probable principle precipitating factors rather than age.",

Symptoms of ADHD have been found to be relatively consistent from childhood through adolescence, whereas adults with ADHD tend to exhibit more symptoms of inattention than hyperactivity. Women and girls with ADHD have generally been insufficiently studied. Whereas core symptoms of ADHD are largely similar between boys and girls, girls exhibit less hyperactivity and comorbid conduct disorder. The precise aetiology of ADHD is unclear, and multiple biopsychosocial risk factors may act independently or in concert to produce disorder. Genetic vulnerability, pre- and perinatal exposures, and psychosocial factors have been found to increase risk of the disorder and its persistence. Childhood ADHD is associated with negative outcomes, such as school underachievement and substance use disorders. Rates of persistence of ADHD from childhood into adolescence and adulthood range widely depending on definition of ADHD and source of reporting of symptoms.",

A broader definition includes symptoms such as disorganised speech and grossly disorganised or catatonic behavior. Negative symptoms such as alogia, amotivation and anhedonia can be present. Cognitive and mood symptoms may also be present. There are relatively few epidemiological studies on child and adolescent onset psychosis. It is generally held that the incidence of psychosis, and especially of schizophrenia, increases markedly during the teenage years, with a preponderance of male over female patients.This is a descriptive review of child and adolescents with psychotic symptoms. It aims to describe their clinical profile, associated risk factors and management strategies utilised.While psychotic disorders are considered rare in children and adolescents, they may severely affect development and long-term functioning. Early identification and intervention are critical to improving outcome. This review suggests that a considerable number of adolescents presenting with psychosis required lengthy periods of inpatient care.There is often diagnostic uncertainty in the first episode of child and adolescent-onset psychosis. Key diagnostic issues relate to distinguishing schizophrenia from bipolar disorder in psychotic adolescents. The differential diagnosis may include psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition, or a substance-induced psychotic disorder.",

      "title": "Self-Harm and Self-Injurious Behaviors in Female Adolescents: A Silent Epidemic, A Review in Literature",
      "abstract": "Self-harm and self-injurious behavior is a widespread problem among female adolescents. Self-injurious behaviors are a dangerous coping strategy used by many female adolescents who lack in the primary needs for managing feelings and coping mechanisms. Although several of these adolescents share an association with diagnoses of traumatic childhood experiences, major depression, alcohol/drug use/abuse, and/or other recognized mental illnesses, the act of self-harm or self-injurious behaviors is not recognized as an isolated mental disorder by the 4th Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Thus, selfharm or self-injurious behaviors continue to remain a problem that is often a silent, and sometimes, deadly behavior among today’s female adolescents. The research conducted surrounded the belief that female adolescents either go undiagnosed with regard to self-harm or self-injurious behaviors or are wrongly diagnosed and that the behavior of self-harm is often combined into categories of Emotional Disturbance. Self-injurious behaviors are not socially acceptable behaviors and therefore, many preconceived notions compromise the treatment of the adolescents. In a review of literature, and surveys of young female adolescents who engage in this behavior, the researcher will conclude that these identified behaviors in females must be acknowledged both by educators, families, and society.

The levels of impairments appear equal to or greater than those associated with other disorders. Furthermore, OCD is specifically associated with higher levels of accommodation, or behaviors that facilitate the completion of compulsive rituals, in relatives. Although levels of general social and family impairments do not demonstrate a clear association with treatment response in OCD, higher levels of pretreatment accommodation and hostility in relatives is associated with poorer response to exposure and response prevention (ERP). In contrast, higher levels of nonhostile criticism in relatives may be associated with enhanced response to ERP in patients. Findings are mixed as to whether family-based treatments for OCD, most of which include psychoeducation and attempts to reduce accommodating behaviors in relatives, are associated with enhanced response to ERP.",

      "title": "Underrated and Underestimated – Deprivation in Dementia. A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Deprivation is widely known in children and adolescents and means a lack of social, emotional, or sensory stimuli, due to disabilities such as deafness, but also social isolation and reduced parental care. It may cause developmental disorders such as impaired language, motoric and social development. Little is known of the impact of social deprivation in demented patients.Stimulus shielding, which is a widespread option for psychiatric symptoms of dementia such as agitation, vocalization and aggressive behavior may – if frequently used- have similar effects on demented patients. Objectives We report the case of a 71-year-old patient with dementia caused by PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy), who was in inpatient treatment due to continuous undirected vocalizations. She presented with inability to walk, dysarthria, aphasia, and hearing difficulties beside major mnestic impairment. In a prior hospitalization and in her residency, she was frequently isolated from other patients due to loud screaming and vocalizations in terms of stimulus shielding by suspected overstimulation. In order to that, for four months, she developed progressive difficulties to speak, hear, understand, as well as gait disorders. In addition, the vocalizations increased. Methods We rated the symptoms due to deprivation, triggered by lack of mobilization, social experiences, visual, tactile and acoustic stimuli following a vicious circle of anxiety, vocalizations and recurrent isolations. Therefore, a multimodal therapy assessment was implemented, including daily physical therapy, mobilization, basal stimulation, social reintegration and basal conversation training. Results After a few days of high intensity treatment, speech reappeared in form of one- word sentences and proceeded to the ability to have short conversations. Mobility increased, starting from severe gait disorder, including the use of a wheelchair and emerged to the ability of walking up to 50 metres. Additionally, the undirected vocalizations improved and were reduced. In addition, hearing ability improved during the four-week treatment. Conclusions This case highlights the impact of deprivation in demented patients. Especially it shows that these symptoms can be reversible under a high intensity multimodal and multi- professional treatment within a few weeks. Therefore, stimulus shielding, should be carefully evaluated in order to prevent deprivation – and thus deterioration of the symptoms – in demented patients. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders with serious individual impairments and societal costs. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in SAD development. Here, I propose that dysregulated social emotions (social fear and shyness) are crucial for SAD development and that these dysregulated social emotions originate in the disturbances in socio-cognitive abilities. The research from our lab confirmed this. It showed that behavioural and physiological indices of social fear contribute to the development of SAD in toddlerhood and early childhood. Later in childhood, between ages 4.5 and 7.5, we found a new risk factor for SAD―dysregulated shyness. Specifically, we found that negative shy expressions and prolonged physiological blushing (temperature increase) contribute to SAD development. Whereas elevated fear may be rooted in deficits in socio-cognitive skills, dysregulated shyness may be rooted in advanced socio-cognitive abilities. These findings imply that dysregulated social emotions play an important role in SAD and should be explicitly targeted in clinical treatments of SAD.",

      "abstract": "Dementia has rapidly become a major global health crisis. As the aging population continues to increase, the burden increases commensurately on both individual and societal levels. The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are a prominent clinical feature of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). BPSD represent a myriad of manifestations that can create significant challenges for persons living with dementia and their care providers. As such, BPSD can result in detriments to social interaction with others, resulting in harm to the psychosocial health of the person with dementia. While brain deterioration can contribute to BPSD as the disease progresses, it may be confounded by language and communication difficulties associated with ADRD. Indeed, when a person with dementia cannot effectively communicate their needs, including basic needs such as hunger or toileting, nor symptoms of pain or discomfort, it may manifest as BPSD. In this way, a person with dementia may be attempting to communicate with what little resources are available to them in the form of emotional expression. Failing to recognize unmet needs compromises care and can reduce quality of life. Moreover, failing to fulfill said needs can also deteriorate communication and social bonds with loved ones and caregivers. The aim of this review is to bring the differential of unmet needs to the forefront of BPSD interpretation for both formal and informal caregivers. The overarching goal is to provide evidence to reframe the approach with which caregivers view the manifestations of BPSD to ensure quality of care for persons with dementia. Understanding that BPSD may, in fact, be attempts to communicate unmet needs in persons with dementia may facilitate clinical care decisions, promote quality of life, reduce stigma, and foster positive communications.",

      "title": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with Psychotic Features:-A Phenomenological Study",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY It has been postulated that obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) lies in a cuntinuum between schizophrenia and the neurotic disorders. Patients of pure OCD develop psychotic symptoms when there is a transient loss of insight or there is emergence of paranoid ideas. Depression is frequently associated with OCD, which could either be a complication of OCD or could be an independent coexisting disorder. In our study, 17 out of 52 OCD patients had psychotic features. Relatively more patients in the psychotic group were found to be single. They had higher score on YBOCS, BPRS and HDRS (SIGH-D} as compared to the OCD patients without psychotic features, 76.47% of the patients with psychotic features also fulfilled the DSM III-R criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. The possible explanation and implication of the findings have been discussed in the light of relevant literature. Key words: obsession, compulsion, psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms INTRODUCTION Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (OCD) is characterized by recurrent obsessions or compulsion that are significantly distressing or time consuming or that cause significant interference with social or occupational functioning (DSM IIIR, APA, 1987). It has been postulated that obsessive compulsive disorders lies in a continuum between schizophrenia and the neurotic disorders (Goldberg, 1965; Blacker, 1966). Obsessive compulsive symptoms have also been observed in schizophrenia (Stengel, 1945. Rosen, 1957; Fenton McGlashan, 1990), in whom obsession may precede schizophrenic symptoms. Earlier studies by Rudin (1953), Ingrain (1961), and Lo (1967) have shown that 1%-10% of patients with OCD subsequently develop schizophrenia, however Goodwin et al (l969) pointed out that most of these studies had used a broad criteria for the diagnosis of OCD. Inspite of the high incidence of psychosis in, OCD most of the cases cannot be diagnosed as schizophrenia according to current diagnostic systems. Welner et al (1976) had reported that out of their 14 patients of OCD with psychotic symptoms (having delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) only 2 met the criteria for schizophrenia while the remaining 12 showed prominent affective symptoms. The relation between OCD and depression is complex, with some believing depression to be a complication of OCD (Lo, 1967; Rosenberg, 1968, Goodwin et al, 1969), whilst others believe that OCD and depression are two distinct disorders which often co-exist (Monteiro et al. 1986; Jenike et al, 1987. Vallejo et al, 1988: Rasmussen & Eisen, 1989). Goodwin et al (1969), after reviewing 13 follow-up studies had concluded that OCD patients were predisposed to depression but did not develop schizophrenia more frequently than non obsessional patients. In fact, Insel Akiskal (1986) have asserted that in the current classificatory systems most of the OCD cases with psychotic features will be either diagnosed as snood disorders or paranoid state rather than schizophrenia. The present study was conducted to assess the presence of psychotic features and depression simultaneously in OCD patients in whom schizophrenia was ruled out and to examine the relationship between the psychotic features and depression.

      "abstract": "Perinatal mental illness influences obstetric outcomes, mother-baby interactions and longer term emotional and cognitive development of the child. Psychiatric disorders have consistently been found to be one of the leading causes of maternal deaths, often through suicide. Postnatal depression and puerperal psychosis are two disorders most commonly associated with the perinatal period. The most efficient strategy to identify patients at risk relies on focussing on clinically vulnerable subgroups: enquiries about depressive symptoms should be made at the usual screening visits. Attention should be paid to any sign of poor self-care, avoidance of eye contact, overactivity or underactivity, or abnormalities in the rate of speech. Particular care should be taken to ask about suicidal ideation and thoughts of harming others, including the baby. One of the most important risk factors is a previous history of depression. The degree of risk is directly correlated with severity of past episodes. Both antenatal and postnatal depression are being increasingly recognised in men. Puerperal psychosis is rare (1 to 2 per 1,000). Sixty per cent of women with puerperal psychosis already have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Women with a personal history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar affective disorder should be considered as high risk for postpartum psychosis. All pregnant women who are identified as being at high risk should have a shared care plan for their late pregnancy and early postnatal psychiatric management. Women with current mood disorder of mild or moderate severity who have a first-degree relative with a history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis should be referred for psychiatric assessment.",

After a brief summary of human functioning in this subculture, we have examined at St-Jean de Dieu Mental Hospital the social history of young schizophrenic farmers, paying special attention to the following areas: mental development, physical illnesses, schooling, work, delusional material and ideas of reference, parental acceptance or rejection. After a psychosexual and physical development considered as normal by the family, the young schizophrenic quits school after the 5th grade. Described as shy but hard working, he is known to drink heavily during the week end: usually he does not mingle with girls. The importance of religion in his “milieu” is evident if you consider the unusual amount of religious material in the delusions and the ideas of reference and grandeur of the patient. Identification to God whether in His sufferings or His triumph is quite frequent. When recovered from the acute phase of psychosis, the young schizophrenic is well received by his family. In brief some preliminary conclusions are drawn. 1) Psychoanalytic treatment and deep psychotherapy are not usually indicated or successful in dealing with his disintegrating ego. 2) So far as the acute phase is cleared by biological treatment, the patient should be returned home rapidly. 3) His religious ideas should be more carefully scrutinized to get a better understanding of his emotional problems. 4) A hebephrenic reaction does not necessarily indicate a poorer prognosis than a paranoid one. 5) Heredity seems better known among them, not especially more productive of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of rapidly growing disabilities. They are characterized by repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, problems in social interactions. ASD is a complicated neurological disorder that is characterized by behavioral and psychological problems in children. These children become distressed when their surrounding environment is changed because their adaptive capabilities are minimal. The symptoms are present from early childhood and affect daily functioning. Children with ASD have co-occurring language problems, intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy at higher rates than the general population.Childhood disintegrative disorder, also called disintegrative psychosis and Heller syndrome, is a rare disorder that is categorized under ASD. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), childhood disintegrative disorder, along with other types of autism, are merged into a single spectrum called autism spectrum disorder. Childhood disintegrative disorder has a relatively late onset and is characterized by regression of previously acquired skills in the areas of social, language, and motor functioning. It is not known what causes this disease, and it is often seen that children who have this disorder have achieved normal developmental milestones before the regression of skills. The age at which this disease manifests is variable, but it is typically seen after three years of reaching normal milestones. The regression can be so fast that the child may be mindful of it, and in the beginning, may even ask what is going on with them. Some children may appear to be responding to hallucinations, but the most common and distinct feature of this disease is that the attained skills are gone.Many children are already delayed when the disorder becomes apparent, but these delays are not always evident in young children. This condition has been described as a devastating disease that affects both the individual's life and the family.",

Despite this they have to experience sociopsychological attitudes which are prejudices with a typical stereotype which ignore the unique structure of everybody's potential who lost eyesight. The source of prejudices is general lack of information of people as regards actual sequelae of loss of eyesight and the emotional reaction of people with normal eyesight. A certain part is also played by tradition which does not take into account results of modern care of thus affected subjects. Prejudices cause in subjects with severely affected eyesight and in blind persons mental stress and render their actual social integration (employment, partnership etc.) more difficult.

Les symptômes psychotiques, chez l'épileptique, peuvent entrer dans le cadre de psychoses intercritiques, post-critiques ou alternatives.

Dans ce type de psychose, une indifférence affective et une restriction des activités sont rarement rencontrés, alors que les fluctuations rapides de l'humeur sont fréquentes. Les thématiques délirantes sont assez souvent mystiques, alimentées par des hallucinations auditives et par des hallucinations visuelles inhabituelles. Les troubles négatifs sont rares. Les psychoses épileptiques n'ont pas été identifiées comme des entités nosographiques dans les systèmes de classification psychiatrique (DSM-IV et CIM-10), ce qui pose un problème de reconnaissance de ces troubles.

We describe a case of probable autoimmune psychosis in a young patient who experienced a severe first psychotic episode. Objectives Reflection over the diagnostic challenges of autoimmune psychosis. Methods Clinical case report. Results A 19-year-old male patient with no relevant medical history was admitted to the psychiatric ward due to a first psychotic episode with a peracute onset. The episode peaked with severe confusion, disorientation, and disorganized behavior, leading to his referral to the emergency room. This episode was characterised by delusional ideation with mystical, self-referential, and persecutory themes, complex auditory-verbal hallucinations, and marked negative and cognitive symptoms (including affective blunting, social withdrawal, apathy, alogia, impaired attention, decreased social cognition, and reduced speed of cognitive processing). The analytical study, substance screening, and brain CT upon admission were normal, leading to the assumption of a primary psychotic disorder. Antipsychotic therapy was initiated with progressive titration (risperidone, cariprazine, and clozapine), yet there was no significant improvement. Given the severe presentation and treatment resistance, a neurological examination was requested, which revealed no focal signs. A comprehensive laboratory workup showed positive ANAs, anti-recoverin antibodies, and hypocomplementaemia (C3 and C4). No significant abnormalities were observed in the brain MRI. CSF analysis revealed slight protein elevation (55 mg/dL) without pleocytosis, oligoclonal bands, or antibodies. EEG indicated mild to moderate encephalopathy with FIRDA bursts and focal paroxysmal activity in the left temporo-parieto-occipital region. Brain PET-FDG showed no significant abnormalities. Serum and CSF neurofilament levels were normal. Full-body CT and PET-FDG scans were also unremarkable. Given the findings, autoimmune psychosis was assumed. Treatment with IV immunoglobulin (30 g) and methylprednisolone (1 g for 5 days) was administered. The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting, and a regimen of daily prednisolone (10 mg) was chosen. At follow-up, the patient showed slight improvement, with mitigation of the positive symptoms. Conclusions Psychosis that does not respond to antipsychotic treatment and presents with atypical signs should raise suspicion of secondary immune-mediated schizophreniform psychosis. However, the challenge lies in identifying these patients, selecting appropriate diagnostic tests, and establishing criteria for implementing treatment. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "An increasing amount of empirical studies demonstrates that anomalies of self-experience (self-disorders) are characteristic of schizophrenia and related spectrum conditions, indicating that self-disorders (SDs) are likely to constitute important vulnerability phenotypes. On a clinical level, SDs are non-psychotic alterations of subjective experience that include disturbances of self-awareness (e.g., fading first-person perspective, waning sense of basic identity, depersonalization and hyperreflectivity), autopsychic disorders (e.g., thought pressure or block, perceptualization of mental stream and spatialization of thoughts), loss of common sense (e.g., perplexity), and existential alterations (e.g., solipsistic grandiosity). Such experiences, define essential aspects of the clinical expressions of schizophrenia lending psychopathological coherence to its spectrum manifestations. Furthermore the experiential nature of SDs makes them amenable to the patient's introspection which can be elicited in the dialogical context of the psychiatric interview with important implication for the therapeutic relation. The aim of this presentation is to illustrate the phenomenological core of these experiential anomalies, emphasizing their topicality for the exploration of vulnerability to schizophrenia spectrum conditions and their coherence with the overall clinical picture.",

Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by social difficulties, including problems in recognizing the emotions of others. The disorders of autism, schizophrenia, depression, social anxiety, and borderline personality disorder all involve difficulties in social cognition, which include deficits in recognizing emotions. However, the nature of these difficulties within and between psychiatric disorders is not well understood. One problem is that differences in the methodologies and samples utilized within emotion research often make it difficult to make comparisons across studies and disorders. Despite these differences, some commonalities in deficits for perceiving emotional expressions have been noted within psychopathology, which include differences in processing of emotions involving negative valence. This may suggest dysfunction of a primary emotion system centered on the amygdala in the brain, although the exact nature of this dysfunction may vary between some disorders.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen.

      "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia is the third most common form of dementia. It begins insidiously with alterations in personality, emotional blunting, and lack of insight. Personality changes frequently begin with apathy, inertia, and lack of initiative; these may be misinterpreted to be depression. Individuals also display socially inappropriate behavior with lack of empathy and poor judgment. Frontotemporal dementia is the most common form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a term that refers to a variety of pathological processes that preferentially affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. In the case of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease, some patients first present with the motor neuron disease component, namely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Frontotemporal dementia is a relatively common form of dementia. In about half of cases, there is a genetic basis and a family history may be elicited.",

Approximately 70% of individuals with autism are mentally retarded, and nearly 50% of cases never develop useful speech. These disturbances are lifelong, although they may be modified by education, by circumstances, and perhaps by maturation. Autism is surprisingly common, with an incidence of approximately 1/1000. Although first described in 1943 by Kanner (1943) and in 1944 by Asperger (1944), it came under far more intense scrutiny and saw greater public awareness beginning in the 1970s. Milder forms have been recognized, other conditions (such as the general categories of ‘developmental language delays’ and ‘mental retardation’) are now being appreciated as frequently harbouring the diagnosis of autism, and individuals with autism are being more publicly visible, and even in some cases speaking out on their own behalf (e.g. Grandin & Scariano, 1996).",

      "abstract": "Impairments in social cognition, such as inadequate perception or understanding of socially relevant information, are common and salient sequelae of many neurocognitive, neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Presence of social cognitive impairment is core to diagnosis in some conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but they can also be acquired or exacerbated through a range of other presentations, such as serious brain injury, e.g. traumatic brain injury, or through development of a psychiatric disorder, e.g. schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Social cognitive deficits are known to disrupt interpersonal relationships, with negative consequences for the everyday life functioning and social participation of patients. Hence, effective treatments are sorely needed. This chapter provides an overview of neuropsychological rehabilitation methods, with consideration to how these relate to the remediation of social cognition. It then reviews the evidence base of social cognitive treatment interventions that target one or more processes of social cognition, e.g. emotion recognition, empathy, theory of mind, and social behaviour. A distinction is made between treatments that focus on a single aspect of social cognition versus treatments that are multifaceted. Treatments developed for patients with serious brain injury will be discussed in detail, with approaches trialed in ASD and SSD also considered.",

Objectives It is proposed, through a clinical case, to know the characteristics of this disorder, evolution, differential diagnosis and therapeutic possibilities Methods 62-year-old male, history of harmful alcohol consumption and a previous admission to a psychiatric short hospitalization unit for self-injury (superficial cuts in the context of severe mental illness of his wife) post-transplantation who is required by ideas of death, anhedonia and lack of collaboration in patient, The day before the evaluation, refusal to take oral treatment, selective mutism. Pre-transplant evaluation where no psychopathological alteration was observed. Results What is initially assessed and treated as a confusional episode of inactive type, through a correct psychopathological examination and with subsequent continuous interviews, with mood fluctuations throughout the admission, is subsequently oriented as an acute stress disorder, adaptive reaction with an anxious-depressive component and finally concluding that we are facing a dissociative disorder, highlighting the depersonalization/derealization on a dysfunctional personality base. Conclusions Characteristic of depersonalization is the great difficulty in describing symptoms, the feeling of being disconnected from one’s own body, emotions and reality. The latest studies on etiopathogenesis with MRI show an inhibitory response on the limbic system by hyperactivation of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as well as a decrease in the autonomic response, the initial result being the attenuation of the processing of emotions. Among the differential diagnoses: post-anxiety illness disorder, major depressive episode, other dissociative disorders, panic disorder, psychotic disorder, substance-induced disorder There are several partially effective treatments, although the results so far are poor. SSRIs, quetiapine and naltrexone have been tried. Partial efficacy with lamotrigine together with SSRIs and, if high levels of anxiety coexist, SSRIs together with clonazepam. There are studies where psychodynamic psychotherapy, behavioral therapy and hypnosis have obtained partially effective results. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Depression is a universal experience, which affects approximately 15 percent of the population at any one time. Depression can be conceptualized as occurring on a continuum from first-level transitory to middle-level to severe-level depression. It involves an alteration in mood characterized by feelings of sadness and loss of interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, the client's usual activities and pastimes. Alterations in thought, motor activity, somatic sensations, and social relationships are also associated with depression. Severe depression can also be associated with delusional thought patterns. Finally, depression can vary in length of duration; it can be transitory and short-lived or ongoing and chronic. Assessment of individual, family, and community factors is important in identifying the factors relevant to planning individualized care for the depressed client and his/her family. Nursing diagnosis includes problems of low self-esteem, feelings of despondency, suicidal thoughts/impulses, and vegetative signs of depression. Nursing interventions are guided by certain principles, and are best evaluated when expected client behaviors have been projected. In conclusion, the overwhelming majority of those who experience depression recover and achieve a higher level of wellness than before the depression; that is, if they use the opportunity to develop a more realistic view of self, others, and their world relationships.",

It is characterized by a persistent and repetitive pattern of aggressive, noncompliant, intrusive, and poorly self-controlled behaviors that violate either the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.1 These behaviors have a significant impact on the daily functioning of the child or adolescent and on the ability of parents and other adults to manage them. The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

Method: We report a case of induced obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a married couple. Six months after the deterioration in the patient's OCD, his wife developed the same symptoms with no preceding history of an Axis I disorder. Neither spouse demonstrated psychotic symptomatology. The husband was successfully treated on an outpatient basis with Citalopram and Clonazepam. His wife's OCD spontaneously resolved without medication in parallel with the resolution of her husband's OCD. Results: We highlight the uncommon phenomenon of shared psychiatric disorder occurring in the context of OCD. In the current psychiatric diagnostic nomenclature, (DSM IV and ICD10), there is no category for a non-psychotic shared psychiatric disorder. We raise the question of broadening the concept of shared disorder so as to include shared OCD and perhaps other shared psychiatric syndromes. Conclusions: More controlled studies are required in order to better understand the psychopathology and mechanisms of psychotic and non-psychotic shared disorders in psychiatry. We believe there are important treatment implications of such an understanding.",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) resource is updated regularly, provides symptoms, signs, treatments, and characteristics, and is used throughout the United States and beyond. ADHD is classified with either predominately inattention or predominately hyper-activity and impulsivity. ODD is another externalizing behavior disorder. According to the DSM-5, this disorder is classified as externalizing because it manifests in behaviors that \"violate the rights of others and/or bring the individual into significant conflict with societal norms or authority figures\". Unlike other disorders, CD is difficult to treat, so the emphasis must be on proactive strategies and prevention.",

      "abstract": "Tourette Syndrome (TS) is more than having motor and vocal tics, and this review will examine the varied co-morbidities as well as the social impact and Quality of Life (QoL) in individuals with TS. The relationship between any individual and his/her environment is complex and this is further exaggerated in the case of a person with TS. For example, tics may play a significant role in shaping the person's experiences, perceptions and interactions with the environment. Further, associated clinical features, co-morbidities and co-existing psychopathologies may compound or alter this relationship. The common co-morbidities in this regard include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and disruptive behaviours, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and co-existent problems include anxiety, depression and low self esteem, which can all lead to poorer psychosocial functioning and QoL. Thus, the symptoms of TS and the associated co-morbid conditions may interact to result in a vicious cycle or a downward spiralling of negative experiences and poor QoL. The stigma and social maladjustment in TS and the social exclusion, bullying and discrimination is considered to be caused in large part by misperceptions of the disorder by teachers, peers, and the wider community. Improved community and professional awareness about TS and related co-morbidities & other psychopathologies as well as the provision of multidisciplinary services to meet the complex needs of this clinical population are critical. Future research to inform the risk and resilience factors for successful long term outcomes is also warranted.",

This paper will focus on one deficit frequently observed in schizophrenia, hypohedonia, the diminished capacity to experience pleasure. As hypohedonia is difficult to distinguish from lack of social interest, avoidance and withdrawal from activity and interpersonal contacts, the following aspects of hypohedonia will be reviewed: definition; etiology; demographic characteristics; specificity to schizophrenia; related clinical features; and prognosis. Of special concern will be the implications of hypohedonia for the practice of occupational therapy and the possibilities for O.T. clinical intervention. Finally, the frustration and difficulties experienced by the clinician in developing the therapeutic relationship and maintaining professional interest will be addressed.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most common psychotic illness, typically appearing between the late teenage years and the mid-30s. The first episode of psychosis may be preceded by a prodromal period. Schizophrenia symptoms fall into six common symptom clusters: delusions and hallucinations, disorganization of speech, cognitive dysfunction, negative symptoms, affective symptoms, and motor system abnormalities. The diagnosis is based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, including exclusion of other possible medical or psychiatric etiologies of psychosis. The main goals during the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected schizophrenia are to rule out secondary etiologies of symptoms and to assess for significant comorbid conditions, balancing broad screening tests with the exclusion of specific disorders suggested by the presentation and history. After the initial evaluation, antipsychotic drug treatment should be initiated and consideration given to psychosocial treatments in conjunction with pharmacotherapy. Comanagement of the patient by a mental health subspecialist and a family physician is important to ensure appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management of common associated conditions.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "abstract": "Both the number of patients with dissociative disorder and that of those with self-injury have been increasing since the end of the twentieth century, suggesting that dissociation and self-injury might be closely related. When dissociative disorder coexists with self-injury, it implies self-punishment and a wish to be understood by others. Although many cases of self-injury observed since 2000 lacked traumatic experiences and were not accompanied by pathological dissociative symptoms, the patients did have dissociative tendencies. According to the results of our study examining self-injury in patients with eating disorders, we observed that self-injury, dissociative tendency and insulation from others are related to each other. This suggests that affects, sensations and representations are dissociated, losing their normal response order, and that the pervasive idea that \"pain=secure\" is formed in a patient from childhood based on influence from their parents. Self-injury appears to be an activation of this pervasive idea that is triggered by a stressful situation, when the dissociative psychological segmentation of effects and their representations are present in the background.",

      "abstract": "While autism and trauma were often linked in psychoanalytic theory, very few scientific attempts have been made to explore the associations and comorbidity between the two. Instead, each area has grown separately, yielding large bodies of theoretical and clinical knowledge.In this article, we suggest several possible pathways that may link trauma and autism. First, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may serve as a vulnerability marker for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), specifically by increasing the risk for exposure to traumatic events. Second, PTSD, once it has appeared, may exacerbate certain ASD symptoms, for example, through maladaptive coping strategies and reduced help-seeking. Third, there may be shared underlying mechanisms for PTSD and ASD, including neurological abnormalities associated with both disorders, as well as cognitive and behavioral mechanisms, such as increased rumination, cognitive rigidity, avoidance, anger, and aggression. In addition, the unique characteristics of ASD may determine which events are experienced as particularly traumatic (e.g., social insults and degradation, sensory overstimulation, abrupt changes in known routines) and affect both the manifestation and severity of posttraumatic sequelae among diagnosed individuals.Research conducted separately in the areas of PTSD and ASD strongly suggests several potential pathways connecting both disorders. We conclude that there is a pressing need for more PTSD-ASD research, focusing not only on the prevalence of traumatic stress in individuals with autism, but also on their potentially unique perception of traumatic events, particularly from the social sphere. Such research may carry important clinical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Emotional problems due to the disease should be taken seriously and included in the treatment plan. A purely dermatological therapy by itself may not achieve its purpose. Even mild to moderate disease can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation, and psychologic change does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. Acne patients suffer particularly under social limitations and reduced quality of life. Psychological comorbidities in acne are probably greater than generally assumed. Attention should be paid to psychosomatic aspects especially if depressive-anxious disorders are suspected, particularly with evidence of suicidal tendencies, body dysmorphic disorders, or also in disrupted compliance. Therefore, patients who report particularly high emotional distress or dysmorphic tendencies due to the disease should be treated, if possible, by interdisciplinary therapy. The dermatologist should have some knowledge of the basics of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, which sometimes must be combined with systemic and topical treatment of acne in conjunction with basic psychosomatic treatment.",

      "title": "Understanding subthreshold depression.",
      "abstract": "The concept of subsyndromal, subthreshold or sub-case depression has received considerable attention in recent decades. Judd and colleagues[1] — who reported that patients with depression are symptomatic more than 60% of the time and that most of that time is spent in subthreshold states— proposed the following operational definition of subsyndromal depression: ‘two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia.’\r\n\r\nDistinguishing major depressive disorder from subthreshold depression and distinguishing the different types of subthreshold depression from each other is one example of a fundamental limitation of our current psychiatric nosology. The elaborate classification systems currently in use in psychiatry are based on subjective descriptions of symptoms. The detailed phenomenology includes descriptions of multiple overlapping clinical subtypes, but there are no biological characteristics that distinguish one subtype from another. Moreover, different disorders can exhibit similar clinical symptoms and the same disorder can have different symptomatic patterns in different individuals.[2] In the absence of biological markers, establishing thresholds in terms of frequency, duration or severity of symptoms that define when a symptom cluster becomes ‘psychopathological’ and that distinguish one symptom cluster from another symptom cluster will always be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe original hope for ICD-10 and DSM-IV was that the diagnostic emphasis on observable behaviors (rather than on presumed cognitions) would advance the reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories. Based on this approach, the core entity of depressive disorders in DSM-IV became a uniform major depressive disorder with modifiers for different subtypes (e.g., psychotic or atypical) and for circumstances presumed to have clinical significance (e.g., seasonal or postpartum depression).[3]–[5] The authors of ICD-10 recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of affective disorders but did not feel that the related science was sufficiently mature: ‘the relationship between etiology, symptoms, underlying biochemical processes, response to treatment, and outcome of mood [affective] disorders is not yet sufficiently well understood to allow their classification in a way that is likely to meet with universal approval’.[5],[9] The reported emphasis of the upcoming DSM-5 on the dimensional aspects of psychopathology may provide an opportunity to more clearly characterize the different manifestations of the different subthreshold conditions along the depressive continuum, but this remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that the depressive symptoms at the major, minor, dysthymic or subsyndromal levels are all integral components of the longitudinal clinical structure of major depressive disorder (MDD), with each symptom level representing a different phase of illness intensity, activity and severity.[1],[2],[6],[7] The different depressive disorders included in official diagnostic systems (i.e., MDD, minor depression, dysthymia) and subsyndromal depression do not represent discrete disorders but, rather, are stages along a dimensional continuum of symptomatic severity.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the current nosological problems will require changing the current phenomenology-based classification system to a classification system based on reliable neurobiological findings that takes into consideration the remarkable synchronization of psychological, social and cultural factors with biochemistry and physiology.[3],[4] Studies of the relationship of stress and illness[2],[4] that clarify the inter-related roles of social, psychological and biological factors in the cause, course and outcomes of mental disorders provide one clear example of the potential benefits of this more integrative approach to the conceptualization of mental disorders.\r\n\r\nIt is now broadly accepted that psychological stress may change the internal homeostatic state of an individual. During acute stress adaptive physiological responses occur, including the increased adrenocortical secretion of hormones, primarily cortisol.[2]–[4] Several authors hypothesize that prolonged dysfunction of the stress response system, characterized by either hyper- or hypo-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, plays a central role in the etiology and course of mood disorders. There is accumulating evidence supporting the suggestion that depressive disorders include individuals with different treatment response profiles who have abnormalities in HPA axis activity and in immune functions.[3]–[5],[8],[9]\r\n\r\nDespite the fluctuating operational criteria and the current lack of definitive biomarkers for subthreshold depressive states, it is clear that the various subthreshold depressive conditions have a high prevalence in the community and are all associated with psychosocial disability, poor quality of life, and high healthcare costs that increase incrementally in parallel with increases in symptom severity.[1],[6],[7] Moreover, individuals with any of the subtypes of subthreshold depression are more likely to experience full-criteria episodes of MDD and to progress into a persistent, fluctuating depressive condition. Thus, research advances in understanding the neurobiology of subthreshold depression and the related development of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for these conditions could substantially decrease the morbidity associated with subthreshold depressive symptoms that, in spite of their high prevalence and impact, are often overlooked, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.",

      "title": "Personality and social cognition in neurodegenerative disease",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases often cause focal damage to brain structures mediating social cognition and personality, resulting in altered interpersonal communication and behavior. We review recent research describing this phenomenon in various aspects of social cognition.Corresponding to their pervasive socioemotional deficits, patients with frontotemporal dementia perform poorly on laboratory-based tasks including recognizing emotions, attending to salient information that guides social behavior, representing social knowledge, comprehending others' mental states, and maintaining insight to their own difficulties. Together with poor executive and regulation mechanisms, these social cognition deficits ultimately impact behavior. Patients with logopenic and nonfluent primary progressive aphasia have some deficits recognizing emotional prosody, whereas those with the semantic variant show more widespread deficits in social comprehension. Although Alzheimer's disease patients perform poorly on some social cognition tasks, this typically reflects general cognitive impairment, and their real-life social functioning is less affected than in diseases targeting frontotemporal structures. Studies in motor diseases such as Parkinson's suggest some degradation of emotion recognition and social comprehension, which should be investigated further.We summarize recent findings concerning perception and evaluation of socioemotional information, social knowledge storage and access, advanced information processing mechanisms, and behavioral response selection and regulation across various neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Body dysmorphic disorder in adolescents: nosology, evolution and treatment. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Body dysmorphic disorder is a diagnostic entity within the somatoform disorders of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum according to the DSM-V. Its prevalence is between 0.7% and 2.5%, being more frequent in men and usually beginning in adolescence or early adulthood. Its central symptom is cognitive distortions regarding appearance, with concern about imaginary physical defects, slight or even invisible to others and in some cases close to a delusional condition. Objectives To delve deeper into the clinical aspects and nosological conditions through the description of a clinical case. Methods This is a 16-year-old patient who was admitted three times to the Acute Psychiatric Unit of the Puerta de Hierro Hospital due to behavioral disorders in the context of dysmorphophobia with intense concern about the shape of his nose. The patient gradually abandoned his daily routines, stopped attending classes at school and isolated himself from his social circle. He is the youngest of two sisters. He lives with his parents and sister. He had good academic results until the time of diagnosis. The patient’s concern about his nose began at about age 15, coinciding with the diagnosis of leukemia of his mother, who was undergoing chemotherapy treatment. The patient reports that the symptoms have increased until causing significant functional limitation. He says that his nose is very large and he doesn’t allow anyone to see it. He leaves the house wearing a mask, performs rituals of checking it for hours in front of the mirror and has even manipulated his nose with objects to try to deform it. He appears to have a delusional component with significant emotional and behavioural repercussions. Results Several pharmacological treatments were started, including SSRIs (sertraline) and various antipsychotics (risperidone, pimozide and olanzapine), with little response in all cases. Psychotherapeutic treatment was carried out in a day hospital for adolescents, but this was also unsuccessful. Finally, he was involuntarily transferred to a Medium Stay Unit given the significant impact of the symptoms on his life, showing progressive improvement after several months of treatment. Conclusions The nosology of TDC has evolved: the DSM IV specified a delusional variant within the psychotic spectrum and a non-delusional one within the somatoform spectrum. The DSM V integrates it within the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. In order to assess a correct treatment, a continuum could be established between TDC and eating disorders. Both present similar symptoms: dissatisfaction and distortion with body image, need for continuous checking and concern about imperfections in perceived appearance. Given the chronicity of TDC and the tendency to abandon treatment in the first months, long-term follow-up by a multidisciplinary team is necessary, as well as psychoeducation and the establishment of a solid therapeutic alliance.

      "title": "Psychiatrists and Forensic Psychology 2016: The resilience of personality disorders: The possible change through an integrated approach-Barbara Sartini-Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore of Medicine",
      "abstract": "Personality disorders are examined in 40 - 60% of psychiatric patients. Those with personality disorder manifested great problems in interpersonal relationships, unstable self-image, marked impulsitivity and so in dealing with everyday life. Although the causes of the disarray are multifactorial, mainly, the common factors concern: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tEID Emotional intensity disorder  \r\n\tHypersensitivity to life events, \r\n\tHyper emotional reactivity, \r\n\r\n\r\nSlow return to a baseline psychic equilibrium. \r\n\r\nThe fetish is the alter of these types of personalities (EID personalities), so emotionally vulnerable, to resilient personalities. Resilience is the ability to handle effectively to everyday problems, in spite of the past life’s unfavorable and traumatic events. Research has shown that flexibility is ordinary, not extraordinary. People commonly reveal resilience. It is not a feature, that is present or absent in the individual, but, instead, refers to behaviors, thoughts and actions that can be erudite by anyone. The old symbol applies: flexible people are like bamboo in a hurricane they bend rather than break. Or, even if they feel like they’re broken for a time, there’s still a part of them bottomless inside that knows they won’t be broken forever. Here’s how they do it...\r\n\r\nThe toughness personality:   \r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe ability to make rational plans and take steps to carry them out. \r\n\tA positive sight of   yourself and   confidence in your strengths and abilities. \r\n\tKeep high-quality and supportive relationships. Have a menu of self-care habits. \r\n\t(They have a mental list of high-quality habits that support them when they need it most.)\r\n\tSkills   in communication and problem solving. \r\n\tThe capacity to supervise strong feelings and impulses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my job, I have been able to monitor and verify how the socio therapy approach in the therapeutic community (Maxwell Jones’model) integrated with the STEPPS’s training (Nancy Bloom) can develop flexible personalities. \r\n\r\nThe sociotherapy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIntroduces novel potential for action entrusted to the patients themselves,\r\n\tHighlights a number of strategy for the treatment and the growth of the “healthy” part of the individual problematic. Certainly the most important event of this definition dates back to the“Therapeutic Community” by Maxwell Jones (England,1940). It was based on a condition of ideal equality of the hospital institution’s members. The patient has an active role in the treatment. It promote a continuous and dynamic relationship between individuals and between the individual and the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nSociotherapy’s features and strategies\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tSafety (Rules, agenda of groups and activities)\r\n\t\tEmpowerment (make decisions)\r\n\t\tLiving learning (improve yourself doing experience day by day)\r\n\t\tsympathy (support and share emotions)\r\n\t\tDemocracy (role blurring)\r\n\t\tCommunalism (share daily activities)\r\n\t\tCulture of enquiry (confront about each behavior)\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStepps program\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Iowa agenda began in 1995, based on a systems method to treating individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), originally developed by Bartels and Crotty (1992). That program was afterward adapted and revised by Blum, St. John, and Pfohl (2002), and has been further revised for this second edition.\r\n\r\nThe present program includes two phases: a 20-week basic skills group, and a one year, twice monthly advanced group program called STAIRWAYS.\r\n\r\nThe basic format consists of 3 phases:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAwareness of illness\r\n\t\tEmotion Management Skills Training\r\n\t\tBehavior Management Skills Training\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis therapeutic and riabilitative integration allows to increase in the patients those skills necessary to resume positively the control of their lives, doing the individual experiences as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\trelationships with caring and supportive people,\r\n\t\ttaking positions of responsibility (sociotherapy),\r\n\t\tawareness of their strengths and weaknesses\r\n\t\tLearning of emotional organizational  skills and problem solving (STEPPS).\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality disorders are a diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders that affect approximately 10% of the population (Torgersen, 2005). Since everyone has a personality, but not everyone has a traits disorder, these disorders are careful a variant form of normal, healthy personality. This group of disorder is characterized by difficult thinking patterns; problems with emotional regulation; and difficulty achieving a balance between spontaneity and impulse control.  However, the majority significant and defining feature of personality disorders is the negative effect these disorders have on interpersonal relationships. People with traits disorders be apt to respond to differing situations and demands with a characteristically rigid collection of thoughts, feelings, and behavior.  This rigidity and complexity forming nuanced responses, represents the main difference between healthy and disordered personalities.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of personality disorder is often very complex as these disorder frequently co-occur with each other and with other psychiatric categories of disorders.  The present diagnostic system of the DSM-5 (APA, 2013) relies upon a categorical approach.  An alternative to the categorical diagnostic approach, called a dimensional approach, was presented and discussed.  Both methods were compared and contrasted. \r\n\r\nThe exact cause of personality disorders remains uncertain.  However, it is clear there are both biological and, psychosocial factors that control the development of personality and personality disorders.  Several psychological theory of personality disorder effort to explain the psychosocial origins  of personality disorders.  The following psychological theory of personality disorder were reviewed:  object relations theory, attachment theory (including mentalization), and cognitive-behavioral theory (including dialectical behavior theory and schema theory).  In addition to these exact theories of personality disorder, the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) that codes social connections was discussed as it applies to understanding character disorders.  The contributions of neuroscience were discussed as well.\r\n\r\nThis is no longer the case.  There are now quite a few highly effective treatments for personality disorders that derive from the same psychological theories previously reviewed.  In conclusion, current technological advancements and improvements to diagnostic methodologies have enabled researchers to study personality and personality disorders as never before. As a result, we now have a much greater understanding of these disorders. Furthermore, this research has facilitated the development of several highly effective treatments for personality disorders that are evidenced-based. As research continues, these treatment approaches will be further refined. Therefore, we can state with confidence there is hope and relief for people affected by these disorders, including their family members and loved ones.\r\n\r\nThis work is partly presented at 4th Global Euro Conference Psychiatrists and Forensic Psychology November 10-11, 2016 Alicante, Spain",

However, the neural mechanisms underlying these social symptoms are largely unknown. Here, we discuss studies investigating trust in psychosis by means of the interactive trust game, and through trustworthiness ratings of faces. Across all the stages of the continuum reduced baseline trust was found in various studies, possibly suggesting a trait-like vulnerability for psychosis. In repeated interactions chronic patients engage less in trust honouring interactions, although they show intact reactions to facial expressions. Overall, first-episode patients and individuals at high risk for psychosis also show reduced trust, but are able to learn to trust over repeated interactions. Several factors that can influence trust are discussed. At the neural level, differential activation in brain regions associated with theory of mind and reward processing were found in individuals with psychosis across illness stages. Theoretical accounts considering motivation, cognition and affect are discussed and suggestions for future research are formulated.",

It is quite common that the first acute symptoms to occur in early adult life and cause severe distress not only to the patient in need but also to their families. The schizophrenia clinical picture is usually misunderstood by the general public and consists of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized speech or behavior during a specific amount of time. In order to establish an accurate diagnosis, it requires taking into consideration both international classification systems, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and The International Classification of diseases (ICD-10), adding a fresh perspective to the newest chapter of ICD-11 called “Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders”, alongside with the diagnosis criteria, other new symptoms such as cognitive impairment emerge as an important feature of schizophrenia.",

Delusions of sex change have been described by some authors in about 20-25% of schizophrenic patients. Patient's \"pseudotranssexual\" beliefs are usually bizarre and do not cause diagnostic doubts. In some cases complaints of gender dysphoria are predominant and psychotic symptoms can be underestimated or even unnoticed before sex reassignment procedure. Presentation of various clinical manifestation of gender dysphoria in patients with schizophrenia. Three clinical cases are described. Two patients have developed \"pseudotranssexual\" beliefs during course of psychosis. The first of them is an example of gender identity disorders related to psychotic process. The second patient presented complex psychopathology of schizophrenia and somatic symptoms which can hinder the diagnosis. The third patient has been diagnosed as a transsexual woman after diagnosis of severe schizophrenia and has undergone sex reassignment. Next she was hospitalized several times because relapses of psychosis but also because of alcohol withdrawal. Currently this patient has symptoms of dementia and a few severe somatic diagnoses. The experiences of practitioners indicate that coincidence of schizophrenia and gender identity disorder is possible. Nevertheless, the consequence of misdiagnosis and sex reassignment can be serious and unconvertible. That is why the diagnosis of transsexualism in patients with psychosis should not be made hastily. It needs time, careful observation, examination and cooperation of psychiatrist and sexologist.",

The disturbances of perception appear to be fundamental to the other aspects of the disease.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the most common mental disorders affecting perception, emotion, cognition, thinking, and behaviour of the person. The onset is generally in the second decade. Its manifestation varies from patient to patient but its effects are usually severe and long lasting. It can manifest as ‘positive symptoms ’such as hallucinations (hearing voices and seeing things) and delusions (having strange beliefs). People with schizophrenia also suffer from disorganisation and ‘negative symptoms ’(such as tiredness, apathy, and loss of emotion). The patient becomes isolated socially and becomes a burden to the family due to lack of proper knowledge about the disease, frequent relapses due to poor drug compliance, side effects, high negative expressed emotions, poor coping skills, and disability. Due to the chronic nature of the disease, the family members and caregivers are also affected. This social casework report describes how a young adult girl with severe disability and dysfunctional family functioning has become hurdle in the treatment and management. Though pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of this disease, social casework based on structural family therapy approach undertaken along with family psychoeducation, behaviour modification techniques, social skills, and coping, and also supportive work with family members help. A home-based rehabilitation plan was worked to provide relief to the caregivers. It illustrates the positive outcome of individual as well as family intervention using structural, behavioural, psychoeducational, and rehabilitative approaches and techniques with an individual after completing 12 sessions and telephonic feedbacks. This resulted in adequate change of the family functioning as they were able to identify their problems, generate solutions, and apply them.",

Hollander and others pioneered the concept of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum in the early 1990s, and have described its breadth and overlap with other psychiatric disorders. While its place in the psychiatric nomenclature is uncertain, the obsessive-compulsive spectrum is intertwined with the anxiety disorders in both its symptoms and biologic substrates. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has an important place at the center of the spectrum. While currently classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition as an anxiety disorder, OCD is distinct from these conditions in the International Classification of Diseases . There is a strong rationale for its separation from the anxiety disorders. First, OCD often begins in childhood, whereas other anxiety disorders typically have a later age of onset. OCD has a nearly equal gender distribution, unlike the other anxiety disorders, which are more common in women. Studies of psychiatric comorbidity show that, unlike the other anxiety disorders, persons with OCD generally tend not to have elevated rates of substance misuse. Family studies suggest that first-degree relatives of persons with OCD have an elevated prevalence of OCD-related disorders including body dysmorphic disorder, hypochondriasis, and grooming disorders, but not other anxiety disorders except for generalized anxiety disorder. The brain circuitry that mediates OCD appears to be different from that involved in other anxiety disorders. Lastly, OCD is unique with regard to its specific response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, while noradrenergic medications, effective in the anxiety and mood disorders, are largely ineffective. On the other hand, the benzodiazepines, which have little effect on OCD, are often effective for the other anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "The study of insight in bipolar disorder has received limited attention, despite its potential impact on treatment compliance and prognosis. In the current study we compare insight levels during different phases of bipolar disorder, and consider its relationship to symptoms dimensions and epidemiologic variables.Insight ratings obtained from 156 bipolar subjects in any phase of bipolar disorder were compared. A regression analysis was also conducted to identify symptom dimensions predictive of insight levels.Greater impairments in insight were observed during pure manic episodes than during mixed or depressed episodes, or during euthymia. Depressive symptoms were associated with better insight. Improvements in insight with treatment were neither complete nor universal. Lack of insight was unrelated to age, years of illness, age of first psychiatric illness, or lifetime number of hospitalizations.Although psychosis may be associated with impaired insight, other variables also impact on degree of impaired insight. Specifically, depressed mood appears to be associated with preservation of insight. That relationship may transcend strict syndromal diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Back to table of contents Previous article Next article From the ExpertsFull AccessDiagnosing Psychosis in Children and AdolescentsClaudio Cepeda, M.D.Claudio CepedaSearch for more papers by this author, M.D.Published Online:21 Dec 2012https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.pn.2012.12b2There is a developing consensus that the presence of psychosis in childhood is consequential and that it is a risk factor for future psychopathology. In general terms, psychosis is a disturbance of the sense of reality that impairs psychosocial development, cognitive development, and adaptive functioning. Commonly, psychosis implies the presence of delusions and hallucinations (positive symptoms), difficulties in relating to others, and an impairment of understanding and appropriately expressing emotion (negative symptoms). More importantly, in major psychoses, there is a disturbance in language and thinking that interferes with interpersonal communication and understanding reality (thought disorder).Psychotic features are common in mood disorders of childhood and adolescence. These symptoms are also very common in children who have been victims of trauma—that is, physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. In practical terms psychotic disorders are divided into primary and secondary. In the first group belong the major psychoses: schizophrenias, schizoaffective disorders, and the so-called psychotic disorders NOS. In the second group belong the psychoses that frequently accompany a number of severe psychiatric disorders like PTSD, bipolar disorders, mood disorders, and other psychiatric conditions. Clinically, it is not always easy to separate these groups, and as many as 30 percent of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorders turn out to have schizophrenias. For the specific criteria for the diagnosis of psychotic disorders, the reader is referred to the current DSM-IV-TR and the upcoming DSM-5.The assessment of psychosis in children assumes that the clinician has a good background in psychosocial and neurolinguistic development; that assessment consists of six steps:Gathering of history, developmental background, and family history.Psychiatric interview.Physical and neurological evaluation. In every major psychosis emerging during adolescence, a neurological evaluation is mandatory. The examiner needs to rule out medical, neurological, and drug-related schizophrenia-like reactions.Labs and other testing procedures (drug testing, EEG, imaging, genetic, and others studies).Psychological testing.Interpretation of findings. The psychiatric evaluation entails observation and inspection, as well as inquiry about symptoms. The examiner observes how “normal “or “odd” the child looks and his/her quality of relatedness and participation in the interview. The examiner notes the child’s communication and the nature of the child’s narrative to detect evidence of thought disorder or immaturities of speech. Throughout the interview, the examiner is attentive to the child’s demeanor and the quality of the eye contact and his/her emotional display (is the affect appropriate or inappropriate?). The examiner also notes the nature of the child’s language and the quality of the thought processes. The inspection will focus on the determination of the presence of dysmorphic features, involuntary movements or stereotypies, and the ascertainment of the presence of minor physical anomalies associated with neurodevelopmental and genetic disorders.Diagnosing psychosis in adolescents is a matter of systematic interviewing and is rather straightforward. The diagnosis of psychosis in children (preschoolers and preadolescents), in contrast, poses developmental and language challenges. A useful technique when interviewing children under 10 years old is to make the parent an active participant in the inquiry process: the parent becomes the questioner under the evaluator’s guidance. Since sleep time is a sensitive time for the emergence of fears, this is a good topic for starting the exploration of psychotic features. The interviewer tells the parent to ask the child if she is scared at night. If the parent elicits a positive response, the parent should then ask, “What are you scared of?” The child may reveal the nature of the fear, and the exploration continues with the elucidation of what was revealed and its associated issues.Other times, the evaluator guides the parent(s) into a systematic exploration of perceptual or paranoid ideations: Ask the child if he or she hears weird things. “Do you hear scary noises?” “Do you hear voices?” “Do you hear people talking to you when nobody is around?” If the child affirms any of these questions, the evaluation proceeds on the pertinent topic. The evaluator may guide the parent into visual perceptions: “Have you seen monsters? Ghosts . . . shadows . . . persons?” “Do you ever feel that somebody is touching you when nobody is around?” The evaluator at some point may take over the interview when he/she assesses the impact of the responses on the parent. “Do you ever feel people say bad things about you?” “Do you feel people watch you?” “Do you ever feel there are cameras taking pictures of you?” “Do you ever feel people follow you?” “Do you ever feel somebody is after you?” The examiner may also explore for Schneiderian symptoms by asking questions such as, “Do you feel people can read your mind?” “Do you feel people can put thoughts in your mind?” “Do you feel you can read people’s minds?” “Do you feel you can put thoughts into other people’s minds?”Structured diagnostic testing protocols like the K-SADS PL-current and the PANSS, among others, are standard in long-term, developmental, or other research-oriented assessments.The interpretation-of-findings phase relates to the discussion in simple terms of the nature of the child’s disturbance. In general, parents are reluctant to accept the presence of psychosis in their children; parents may explain their offspring’s perceptual or paranoid abnormalities as the impact of TV viewing, the watching of horror movies, or the effects of a vivid imagination. All initial observations should be reported as preliminary. The examiner cannot predict what kind of disturbance the child may have or how the symptoms may vary throughout development. In general, it is a good idea not to give false reassurances, such as “Don’t worry. This will go away. The child will grow out of this,” and so on, or hopeless prognostications; severe symptoms in childhood do not necessarily continue into adolescence and adulthood.No mental status examination is complete without a systematic exploration of psychosis. Every clinician is capable of ascertaining psychosis during childhood and adolescence with sustained focus and appropriate methodology. ■Claudio Cepeda, M.D., is a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Clarity Child Guidance Center in San Antonio and a clinical associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.

The differential diagnosis includes anxiety disorders, factitious disorder, malingering, mood disorders, multi-system medical disorders, schizophrenia with somatic delusions, and other somatoform disorders. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) reduces disability, physical symptoms, and psychological distress for both somatoform disorders and medically unexplained physical symptoms. Caution is prudent in making this diagnosis as many organic disorders may present in a similar fashion to conversion disorders. Hypochondriasis (HC) is the misinterpretation of benign symptoms resulting in preoccupation with having a serious disease.

      "abstract": "Descriptions of visionary experiences from written medieval sources are examined from a cross-cultural perspective. The mental states of the persons having the visions range from terminal illnesses, states of starvation, stress-related syndromes, dreams and hypnagogic states, and seemingly unremarkable mental states. Although a few of the visions elicited some skepticism on the part of contemporaries, most reports of visions were accepted at face value as bona fide visions, with no discernible differentiation between starvation visions, dreams, deliria of illnesses, and possible mental illness. Only four of the visions appeared causally related, by today's standards, to mental illnesses. These persons were not recognized as mentally ill by their contemporaries. Since there was a recognition of mental illness in the Middle Ages, it would appear that such recognition was based on symptoms other than visions or hallucinations. It is also possible that hallucinations, as culturally supported phenomena, were not as available as forms of expression of psychoses in the Middle Ages as they are today. Such a possibility has interesting implications regarding the role of a culture in shaping the forms by which mental illnesses are expressed, recognized, and labeled.",

      "abstract": "Cet article fait le point sur les troubles psychopathologiques de l’enfant épileptique. Malgré les nombreux progrès de la prévention et du traitement médical de l’épilepsie de l’enfant, le taux de troubles psychopathologiques reste stable depuis plus de trente ans. Certains troubles ne sont pas plus fréquemment retrouvés que chez des témoins avec maladie chronique (dépression), alors que d’autres le sont davantage (troubles de l’attention, troubles sociaux, troubles de la pensée), ou sont particulièrement associés à certains syndromes épileptiques (troubles envahissants du développement). D’autre part, des troubles du comportement et la dépression sont parfois retrouvés avant l’apparition d’une épilepsie, ce qui plaide en faveur d’un dysfonctionnement neurobiologique commun à l’épilepsie et aux troubles psychiatriques. L’étude des variables influençant l’apparition de tels troubles montre des résultats contradictoires. Les variables propres à l’épilepsie ne semblent pas influer sur les troubles psychiatriques, sauf par le biais des troubles cognitifs secondaires à l’épilepsie. En revanche, les variables familiales (troubles du fonctionnement familial, dépression maternelle plus fréquemment retrouvés que chez les parents d’enfants témoins), et surtout la perception parentale du contrôle de l’épilepsie prédisent mieux l’ajustement parental que le niveau de contrôle de l’épilepsie. Tous les auteurs soulignent que malgré ce constat, la prise en charge psychiatrique est notoirement insuffisante. Ces résultats incitent à proposer des modèles complexes pour mieux comprendre, évaluer et traiter ces troubles, comme les modèles complémentaires et épigénétiques.",

      "title": "Suicidal behavior in adolescents with comorbid depression and alcohol abuse.",
      "abstract": "Depression, alcohol abuse and suicidality each continue to threaten adolescent populations throughout the world. The comorbidity between these diseases has been found to be up to 73% with consistent positive correlations between adolescent drinking, depression and suicidality. Alcohol abuse, depression and suicidal behavior in adolescents have also been found to have biochemical and genetic correlates. This article explores the contributing and causative factors and directional models underlying such prevalent comorbidities. Alcohol use is shown to be both a distal and proximal cause of suicide attempts in adolescent populations. Individuals with both alcoholism and depression who attempt or complete suicide often present with significantly high levels of aggression and impulsivity. These factors may be caused or nuanced by poor or underdeveloped coping skills as well as other comorbid psychiatric conditions. Such behaviors, alone or in comorbidity, may be a consequence of childhood abuse, social pressures, low self-esteem and/or delinquency- all of which may be particularly salient among adolescent populations. Such adolescent stressors are implicated as the cause for the self-medication model. Some studies suggest that depression encourages alcohol use as self-medication and then leads to suicidality, while others imply that the initial alcohol consumption is responsible for increasing depressive and suicidal symptoms in adolescents. This article discusses the social stigma associated with alcoholism, depression and suicidality, and how that may serve to enhance these disorders in adolescent populations. Many directional models are presented based on past research and as suggestions for future research. There is a lot that can be done by clinicians, legal and educational professionals and society at large that may help to prevent and treat such problems.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is characterized by a variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Information-processing dysfunctions differ between clinical subtypes such that nonparanoid schizophrenia patients attend less than paranoid schizophrenia patients to connotative or contextual aspects of stimuli. The positive and negative symptom dimensions are also associated with distinct cognitive deficits. In general, positive symptoms are related to auditory-processing deficits and negative symptoms to visual/motor dysfunctions. The interaction of frontal and septohippocampal brain systems, and failures of information-processing automaticity and self-monitoring, have been proposed as the bases of positive symptoms. Negative symptoms are thought to arise from abnormalities in the complex interactions of frontal and striatal systems. Recent theoretical analyses have recommended a focus on the cognitive and neuropsychological analysis of specific symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) instead of on the more heterogeneous symptom clusters or dimensions. Studies of specific symptoms indicate that patients with hallucinations have deficits in discriminating the source of information. Delusions have been related to abnormal inference processes as well as abnormal perceptual experiences. Studies should now examine the links between information-processing abnormalities and symptoms over time, as the latter change, within the framework of explicit, disconfirmable theoretical models.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Bereavement is commonly experienced among older adults and has been shown to predict adverse health outcomes and may be linked to cognitive impairment. There is a paucity of literature on the impact of bereavement on older adults with dementia, contrasting extensive research on how dementia carers cope with their grief. Methods: 5 case studies of older adults with dementia and their bereavement reactions to losses are reported. The description of the phenomenology of bereavement distress in the case series help to shed light on its unique manifestations and how we can better understand this highly vulnerable group in their grief. Results: Normal grief reactions of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance can be experienced in early dementia. As the disease progresses, persons with dementia (PWD) may be too cognitively impaired to experience and express their grief. A vague sense that something is wrong with inner distress may manifest as behavioural disturbances, for although cognition declines, feelings and states of emotional pain remain. PWD may not be aware of the loss or may confuse the present loss with earlier losses. Seemingly nonreactions of mourning were noted to be much more common than those found among persons with normal intellectual ability. Conclusions: PWD and their families can be supported through the stages of grief by society and other support systems. Ethically, PWD have the right to grieve and mourn but the experiencing of acute grief and distress multiple times with ‘re-traumatization’ when the truth is revealed each time may be considered cruel and insensitive. It may be understandable why some family members and care staff try to shield PWD from reality. There may be questions as to whether or not to tell, how to tell and how the revelation will impact on their psychological well-being as well as their caregivers. PWD need to be approached differently when they experience bereavement and loss. If the grief response of the PWD is not sufficiently understandable in the context of the loss, there is the risk of them being inadvertently excluded from their family’s cycle of grief. Professional and family caregivers need to appreciate that PWD can be capable of grieving and we need to see how we can best support them and their loved ones in their grieving process.",

When the psychopathology progresses to full psychosis, the diagnosis may be clarified—usually in the schizophrenia spectrum in the studies to date.2 For many people, however, the diagnostic picture is less clear at the outset.

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common psychiatric disorder in the peripartum period affecting approximately 8% of European women without prior psychiatric history [1] and even more with pre-existing depressive disorders. Up to 70% of new mothers develop mild depressive symptoms called “baby-blues” which include weepiness, sadness and mood lability. Those symptoms usually peak between 2 and 5 days post-delivery and abate spontaneously within days up to 2 weeks [2]. In contrast to “baby blues” postpartum depression can have a serious impact on functioning and even lead to suicidality rendering it highly important to detect the disorder as early as possible. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [3] is widely used to screen for postpartum depression and should be applied to all new mothers who develop depressive symptoms such as loss of interest, hopelessness and depressive feelings. Several risk factors for postpartum depression have been identified: Prenatal depression poses the highest risk, followed by low self-esteem, childcare stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress and lack of social support [4]. Postpartum depression is a treatable condition, however, it has to be distinguished from bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis, which require different treatment strategies [2].",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

In effect we are saying that we are unable to draw any hard and fast distinction between the paranoid reactions and the paranoid schizophrenias of old age. To a greater extent, as far as the present data are concerned, isolation is merely a consequence of personality anomalies that also portend a schizophrenia in late life. Genetic factors are probably more important in causing schizophrenia in early life than in old age, whereas the reverse is probably true of environmental factors. Except in one subgroup the clinical picture is remarkably uniform and characterized by the presence of many schizophrenia-like disorders of thought, mood, and volition, by relatively good preservation of formal intellect, personality, and memory, and by conspicuous hallucinations.",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

Frente a esse cenário, este trabalho tem como objetivo relatar o caso de uma idosa de 74 anos, que, após comparecer ao ambulatório de psicogeriatria do HC-UFMG para tratamento de Transtorno Depressivo Maior e Transtorno de Ansiedade Generalizada refratários ao tratamento e agravados com a morte do irmão nesse período, desenvolveu um quadro de Transtorno Delirante Primário do subtipo Somático não parasitário, em que pensava ter cimento odontológico nos dentes após tratamento dentário, com alucinações visuais e táteis a respeito do material, culminando em uma tentativa de autoextermínio. Após tratamento adequado, com associação de olanzapina e clomipramina, além de diazepam e venlafaxina, que já estavam em uso previamente, a paciente apresentou remissão dos sintomas psicóticos. Por fim, o cenário relatado é relevante a todos os profissionais de saúde mental, uma vez que o manejo de pacientes com transtorno delirante deve ser feito de maneira diferente quando comparado ao de outros transtornos frequentes na senilidade, e é necessário que o tratamento e acompanhamento sejam conduzidos corretamente a fim de garantir maior qualidade de vida e prevenir episódios de agudização do quadro ou surtos psicóticos.",

It is hardly admitted that frustration of the self-pre- servative instinct by environmental factors can lead directly to a mental illness.This peculiar self-imposed restriction is however compensated to some extent by the Adlerian and Jungian schools.No one who has worked with children, nervous in any sense, can fail to be struck by the immense influence of environ- mental factors, including not only the immediate family, but",

      "title": "Accident-Related Stress in the Elderly: A Review of Current Trends and Implications for Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Introduction Accidents, whether minor or severe, can have significant psychological impacts, especially in elderly populations. Stress related to accidents often exacerbates pre-existing conditions or leads to new mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The psychological impact of accidents on elderly individuals is often compounded by physical frailty, social isolation, and diminished coping mechanisms. Following an accident, elderly individuals may face prolonged recovery periods, limited mobility, and a reduced sense of independence, all of which can heighten stress levels. Additionally, the fear of future accidents may lead to avoidance behaviors, further isolating them from social interactions and routine activities, thus exacerbating anxiety and depression. Pre-existing mental health conditions, such as mild cognitive impairment or chronic illness, can worsen under accident-related stress. Objectives This study aims to explore recent trends in understanding and addressing accident-related stress in elderly individuals, focusing on the psychological, social, and physiological factors contributing to their vulnerability. The primary objective of this study is to examine the psychological, social, and physiological factors that increase the vulnerability of elderly individuals to accident-related stress. Methods A mixed-methods approach was used, combining a systematic review of literature from 2015 to 2024 and interviews with mental health professionals. The sample consisted of 30 peer-reviewed studies and 25 elderly individuals aged 65 and above who had experienced accidents within the last year. Studies were selected based on relevance to accident-related stress in the elderly, with an emphasis on post-accident psychological outcomes and interventions. Results Results indicated that the elderly are more susceptible to prolonged stress responses following accidents due to physical fragility, social isolation, and reduced coping mechanisms. The review also highlighted an underutilization of mental health services in this demographic, despite the availability of stress-reduction programs. Furthermore, findings showed that older adults who participated in targeted mental health interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and peer support groups, experienced better outcomes in managing stress compared to those who did not. Conclusions In conclusion, accident-related stress in the elderly presents unique challenges that require specialized attention. Healthcare providers should prioritize early identification and tailored interventions to mitigate the long-term psychological effects of accidents in this vulnerable population.

      "title": "Manic episode with psychotic symptoms in a patient with Pseudologia Fantastica of years of evolution. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pseudologia Fantastica (PF) also called “mythomania” is a disorder centred on the tendency of the sufferer to distort reality through constant lies. These patients find it difficult to moderate their sense of self and their self-esteem. Therefore, they display significant grandiosity, which seems to defend them from intense psychological disturbance, pretending to counteract deep feelings of unworthiness, emptiness and alienation. Notable characteristics include: normal or above average IQ, absence of formal thought disorder, poor sense of identity, poor sexual adjustment, low frustration tolerance, strong dependency needs and narcissism. The phenomenon of “imposture” (the person’s claim of achievement or having connections to famous or influential people) is frequent. The patient’s history often shows that one or both parents were experienced as rejecting figures. They are more likely to be involved in legal problems and 20% receive some form of psychiatric treatment. The aetiology and pathogenesis of this disorder requires consideration of developmental disturbances, personal history and current life stressors. Objectives A case of a patient with PF is presented followed by a theoretical review on the topic. Methods A case is presented with a bibliographic review. Results We admitted a 47-year-old man to the Acute Hospitalisation Unit for a suspected “psychotic episode with clinical mania”. He presented manic and psychotic symptoms, with delusional ideation of months of evolution, megalomaniacal and fantastic discourse, centred on his work with high-ranking government officials and other implausible events. Multiple academic, work and personal life failures, with a diagnosis of depression 15 years earlier. During admission, he constantly confirms his history. He tends to present a rationalising discourse and a minimising attitude towards behavioural alterations. He appears cooperative and docile at certain times, while at others he is irritable, complaining and threatening. As for medication, olanzapine was initially prescribed at a dose of 20 mg per day, which was reduced to 10 mg given the psychopathological improvement and the difficulties of adherence. On discharge, the presumptive diagnosis was “delusional disorder and probable personality disorder with narcissistic traits, with a history of PF, which in recent months has presented a manic episode with psychotic symptoms”. Conclusions Their management poses challenges in terms of engaging with treatment and building a therapeutic alliance. It is important to assess the social and legal implications. Ensuring that they have stable relationships and adequate social supports is essential for successful treatment. Further exploration and research into this disorder is needed to better understand its manifestations and psychiatric consequences. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

There is a known association among women with previous history of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder and relapse during the menopausal transition. First-onset mood disorders during this time have been less studied. A literature review in PsycInfo Ovid of records pertaining to first-onset mood disorders during perimenopause showed that this multifactorial process involves hormonal fluctuations, with estrogen being a key player. In addition, vasomotor symptoms, previous negative life events, and socioeconomic status were found to contribute to first-onset mood disorders during perimenopause. Treatment options include established medication regimens for psychiatric conditions; however, hormone therapy also has proven beneficial for this patient population. Further research, particularly on bipolar disorder, is needed to develop a clear association between perimenopause and first-onset mood disorders.",

      "title": "Childhood Onset Diagnoses in a Case Series of Teens at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Reasons: Schizophrenia is typically an adult neurodevelopmental disorder that has its antecedents in childhood and adolescence. Little is known about disorders “usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood and adolescence” (e.g., childhood-onset disorders) in “prodromal” teens at heightened clinical risk for psychotic disorder. Main Findings: Childhood-onset disorders were prevalent in putatively prodromal teens, including anxiety and disruptive disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and, surprisingly, elimination disorders. These may reflect developmental antecedents in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Key Data and Statistics: A case series of 9 teens (ages 13–17) identified as prodromal to psychosis were evaluated with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). Childhood-onset diagnoses commonly endorsed (threshold or subthreshold) included ADHD (5/9), oppositional defiant disorder (5/9), enuresis or encopresis (4/9), conduct disorder (2/9), separation anxiety (3/9), and transient tic disorder (2/9). Enuresis was identified in 3 of the 4 older teens (ages 15–17). Major Conclusions: An understanding of the childhood-onset disorders that occur in teens at risk for psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, can shed light on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and potentially inform early identification and intervention.",

      "abstract": "Based on a review of recent publications, the paper offers an insight into the issue of sensory processing disorder (SPD), discusses its signs and symptoms, and gives examples of behaviors that can be seen in children with SPD. It points to the fact that sensory processing disorder can significantly hinder or even limit children's functioning in their social life, family, and school as it deprives them of experiences that are essential for learning and normal development. That is why it is important to diagnose the disorder early to implement treatment that will help to overcome and/or adapt to SPD. The problem of sensory processing disorder is important as more and more children are suffering from it. It should also be mentioned that it is frequently a comorbid condition, which co-occurs, for example, with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and intellectual disability or develops in children at risk of developmental disorders (due to perinatal complications, cesarean section or prematurity).",

Freud elucidated the fantasy distortion and elaboration of traumatic experience and retained the importance of actual trauma. Psychic trauma is associated with the alteration of self and object representations and ensuing new identifications, e.g., with victim and aggressor. The \"deferred action\" of psychic trauma is an antiquated concept and psychic trauma has immediate effects as well as far reaching developmental consequences. Prior trauma predisposes to later traumatic vulnerability and to trauma linked to phase specific unconscious conflict. The pathogenesis of child sex abuse and the enactment of oedipal incest extends before and after the oedipal phase, is often associated with other forms of abuse, and has a history of pathogenic parent-child relationship.",

      "abstract": "Prodromal schizophrenia presents with a wide variety of psychiatric symptoms including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). However, this differentiation between a sole diagnosis of OCD and prodromal schizophrenia seems challenging in some settings. We present a sixteen-year-old male with six-months history of recurrent intrusive images and fearfulness, in addition to decreased socialization. He was managed as a case of prodromal schizophrenia and was treated with antipsychotics. His obsessions decreased but he continued to exhibit negative schizophrenia within two years of follow-up. Acknowledging the diversity of prodromal schizophrenia presentations rather than treating symptoms as a cross-sectional diagnosis (especially in high-risk population for psychosis) is crucial for a better management.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This case illustrates the complexity of the diagnosis of an officially established disorder that is OCD with well-defined criteria and controversial labeling prodromal schizophrenia with several presentations including OCD. The impact of OCD/OCS among prodromal schizophrenia or at-risk people for psychosis was revealed in some studies by having a higher clinical impairment, more depressive symptoms and suicidality.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Our patient was managed as a case of prodromal schizophrenia rather than solely OCD based on the associated features (aloofness, progressive social and academic decline, slowed psychomotor functions and dysprosody). Positive family history of schizophrenia in addition to praecox feeling further confirmed the patient’s condition. The following two years of the patient’s course revealed the necessity of considering the full detailed presentation of prodromal schizophrenia rather than the spot diagnosis of OCD to benefit from early intervention psychosis services and minimize the clinical deterioration.",

However, when there is no access to such history and the initial presentation is from the depressive end of the pole, correctly classifying the disorder as bipolar rather than unipolar then becomes difficult. Being able to correctly classify depression as bipolar rather than unipolar is crucial due to the ramifications of the diagnosis in terms of management. For example, it has been recommended that the depressive period of uncomplicated bipolar disorder should be treated for shorter periods than that for unipolar depression.1 Whereas in unipolar depression antidepressant monotherapy may be appropriate, in bipolar depression, without coupling it with a mood stabilizer, it may precipitate a “manic switch” and create a state of chronic irritable dysphoria and possibly a long-term rapid-cycling course.\r\n\r\nDue to symptomatic similarity between the 2 diagnostic entities, no particular symptom invariably distinguishes between the 2 disorders. However, if residents, psychiatrists, and family physicians can maintain a high index of suspicion, then certain factors from the past or present history would indicate that the depressive episode is more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar. We describe the mnemonic “Bipolar Family” to remind clinicians of factors or symptom clusters that would make a depressive episode more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar (Table 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\n“Bipolar Family”: Factors That Make a Depressive Episode More Likely To Be Bipolar Rather Than Unipolara\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the significant difference in treatment3 and despite the similarity in presentation, we hope that residents, psychiatrists, and primary care clinicians will utilize this mnemonic as a screening tool when faced with a patient who primarily presents with a depressive episode.",

      "abstract": "Cilj je ovog izlaganja analiza odnosa povezanosti između suicidalnosti, osjecaja beznađa i doživljaja gubitka smislenosti života. Osjecaj smislenosti i optimizam mogu se smatrati znakom psihickog zdravlja pojedinca, a njihovo je postojanje ili nepostojanje vrlo vrijedna informacija u klinickoj praksi. S druge strane, osjecaj beznađa i doživljaj gubitka smisla života u korelaciji je s povecanim rizikom za suicidalno ponaπanje. Istraživanje tih varijabli u relaciji s dusevnom boli i drugim cimbenicima interesantno je za svakodnevnu praksu stoga jer se neke populacije clanova nase zajednice razlikuju i prema povecanom suicidalnom riziku. Prije svega to su svi oni koji su iz razlicitih razloga povezani sa socijalnom iskljucenosti, znacajnom promjenom licnosti te intimnim doživljajem dusevne patnje. Konkretno, to su stariji, osobe oboljele od kronicnih tjelesnih i duπevnih poremecaja ili bolesti, a kod nas i skupina osoba oboljelih od poslijetraumatskog stresnog poremecaja vezanog uz traumatizaciju doživljenu tijekom Domovinskog rata. Posebno su rizicne osobe oboljele od psihickih bolesti, poglavito depresije. Međutim, suicidalne misli se javljaju i bez dijagnoze dusevne bolesti, tj. uz depresiju, ali i neovisno o depresiji. Naime, ponekad vanjski faktori mogu pokrenuti psiholosku promjenu povezanu s doživljajem beznađa i gubitkom doživljaja smislenosti života. Kako bismo shvatili cjelinu doživljavanja, ne smije se zanemariti i cinjenica da osim rizicnih, postoje i protektivni faktori. U svakom slucaju, svako otkrivanje faktora visokog rizika za pocinjenje suicida, protektivnih faktora i njihovih interakcija, kao i svjesnost o mogucem znatnom utjecaju osjecaja beznađa i gubitka smislenosti života, iznimno su važni u predikciji i prevenciji suicidalnosti.",

      "abstract": "Des troubles de la familiarite ont ete decrits dans de nombreuses pathologies psychiatriques et neurologiques et seraient a l’origine d’anomalies de la cognition sociale. Dans la schizophrenie, ces troubles peuvent se developper selon deux polarites : l’hyper- et l’hypofamiliarite. Dans l’hyperfamiliarite, les sujets atteints pensent que des proches prennent l’apparence d’inconnus pour les persecuter ; le syndrome le plus decrit est le syndrome de Fregoli. A l’oppose, dans l’hypofamiliarite, les sujets reconnaissent leurs proches d’apres les traits de leurs visages, mais pensent que ce sont des imposteurs qui ont pris l’apparence de leurs proches. Le syndrome de Capgras est le plus decrit dans l’hypofamiliarite et le plus etudie des troubles de la familiarite. Dans la schizophrenie, ces troubles concernent principalement les proches, mais egalement le sujet lui-meme qui peut voir chez des inconnus des doubles de lui-meme, par exemple. Bien que frequents et largement decrits dans la schizophrenie, ces troubles restent tres peu etudies. Ainsi, les mecanismes sous-tendant les troubles de la familiarite dans la schizophrenie sont encore bien mal connus.L’objectif de ce travail de these a ete de mieux comprendre les mecanismes sous-jacents aux troubles de la familiarite dans la schizophrenie au moyen d’etudes comportementales, utilisant la conductance cutanee et d’une etude en imagerie fonctionnelle par resonance magnetique (IRMf).Dans un premier temps, nous avons cherche a developper une echelle clinique permettant le diagnostic des troubles de la familiarite. En effet, a notre connaissance, aucun outil n’est actuellement valide. Il est alors difficile de caracteriser ces troubles et les donnees epidemiologiques sont manquantes. Cette echelle a ete construite d’apres la proposition d’items par des experts des troubles de la familiarite, puis par la selection des items les plus pertinents par d’autres experts. Elle est actuellement en cours de validation. Elle explore 4 dimensions de la familiarite : le soi, les proches, les lieux et les objets et cote ces dimensions respectivement pour l’hypo- et l’hyperfamiliarite.Dans un second temps, nous avons cherche a tester l’hypothese selon laquelle les troubles de la familiarite, dans la schizophrenie, resulteraient d’une anomalie de la reponse emotionnelle lors de la reconnaissance normale d’un visage connu. Pour cela, nous avons enregistre, dans 2 etudes, la reponse electrodermale (RED) engendree par la presentation de visages de soi, familiers, celebres et inconnus. En effet, la RED est utilisee comme le reflet de l’emotion inconsciente generee par la presentation d’un stimulus (ici un visage). Les principaux resultats de nos 2 etudes ont montres que : alors que chez les sujets sains, l’amplitude de la RED etait faible pour la condition « inconnu », elle augmentait pour la condition « celebre » et etait encore plus elevee pour les conditions « soi » et « familier », chez les patients schizophrenes, l’amplitude de la RED etait faible dans toutes les conditions. Plus specifiquement, les patients schizophrenes ayant des troubles de la familiarite avaient une RED avec une amplitude similaire dans les differentes conditions : soi, familier, celebre et inconnu. Ces resultats suggerent qu’une atteinte emotionnelle puisse etre responsable des troubles de la familiarite dans la schizophrenie et que cette atteinte soit du meme ordre pour la familiarite que pour le soi.Enfin, dans une etude en IRMf, nous avons pu mettre en evidence une anomalie de fonctionnement des circuits neuronaux du soi et des circuits de la familiarite dans la schizophrenie. Ces resultats suggerent une demande cognitive plus importante chez les patients (implication de regions du traitement cognitif) pour resoudre l’ambiguite creee par la presentation de visages hautement familiers, nous posons l’hypothese que le soi et le familier sont difficiles a distinguer chez les patients.

      "abstract": "Background: Diogenes syndrome is the combination of severe self-neglect, domestic squalor, social withdrawal, a tendency to hoard excessively, and refusal of help, in elderly patients. Aim: To report a case of Diogenes’ syndrome underlying the impact of pathological hoarding behaviour in the quality of life of the patient. to discuss the pathological hoarding behaviour (syllogomania) in the context of this specific behavioural disorder. Methods: Case study and review of the literature. Results: The subject of this case study is a 78-year-old man with Diogenes syndrome. Hoarding behaviour is the major presentation symptom in this case, along with domestic squalor and social withdrawal. He has marked obsessive personality traits, no insight for his morbid condition and an attitude of refusal of treatment. Discussion: The literature reveals high comorbidity of Diogenes syndrome with psychiatric and somatic disorders. Some authors raise the possibility that obsessive-compulsive disorder may be the cause of hoarding rubbish in those cases of Diogenes syndrome in which hoarding exists and cannot be better explained by other psychopathology. other authors hypothesise Diogenes syndrome as a reaction to stress in elderly people with certain personality characteristics or as the end stage of a personality disorder. the ethiopathogeny of Diogenes syndrome remains unclear and there is no consensus about diagnostic criteria. It is a relevant area for future research, contributing for a better comprehension of the differential diagnosis of pathological hoarding behaviour and late life psychopathology.",

      "title": "Growth at adolescence. Clinical correlates.",
      "abstract": "Several highly significant changes occur within a relatively short period of time during adolescence. Great alteration in physique, developmental progress in thinking, and psychologic gains toward attaining ego identity take place but not always synchronously. Attention is paid to physical changes because they are visible and are of intense concern to adolescents, but physicians and other professionals should remember cognitive and psychosocial growth are affected by physical growth, and vice versa. Often there is a temporary disequilibrium in the relationship of these three areas of growth, and this can affect one or another part of the developmental pattern. It is therefore necessary to remind ourselves of the diversity of adolescent growth, and of adolescents, when caring for a young patient and be cognizant of growth in areas other than physical. More and more children with congenital or acquired handicaps are living to become adolescents and perhaps adults. Handicaps can be limited to one of the three major areas of growth or involve them all in varying degrees. For example, sickle cell disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis may postpone physical growth for a significant period; this lack of pubertal change can affect psychosocial development but usually does not impair cognitive growth. Mental retardation may have no apparent effect on physical growth but can handicap the adolescent's psychosocial development. Growth still occurs in a sequential pattern but often it seems that handicapped youngsters reach a developmental milestone by a series of \"detours.\" Physicians must recognize these lags or differences and try to facilitate progress, promote self-esteem, and provide understanding. Much can be done with anticipatory guidance. Adolescence often provides the opportunity to overcome past damage or, in some instances, to start anew on a more optimal program for physical and psychosocial growth. Young adolescent boys and girls usually look to the physician for factual information and guidance; they long for understanding by an adult outside of the family. If we can successfully fill their expectations, adolescents will be the better for it.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

It is noteworthy that the symptoms of depersonalization and derealization are commonly found in many other psychological disorders, including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, while phenomenological features of schizophrenia are commonly found in DPDR . The current study attempts to clarify these apparent similarities via highly detailed phenomenological interviews with four persons diagnosed with DPDR . The data revealed four interrelated facets: 1, Loss of resonance, 2, Detachment from experience, 3, Loss of self, and 4, Commitment to reality. These facets point to a felt loss of immediate and familiar engagement in experience as a basic organizing Gestalt which permeates the various symptoms and signs of our participants with DPDR . Close consideration of this disruption allows their experiences to be more easily distinguished from those of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.",

Whereas these are often considered important indicators of mental health problems in people, in companion animals, many owners view these behaviours as quirky or even amusing features of their pet. However, the absence of self-report also means that the array of repetitive behaviour conditions in companion animals is also much more diverse than in humans and there is a danger of drawing simple analogies between human and non-human animals based on very superficial phenotypic features. For example, the following differentials might be considered for a dog who chases its tail:\r\n •Seizure possibly a primary partial seizure or secondary to a lesion in the brain such as damage to the vestibular system \r\n•Inner ear infection \r\n•Play \r\n•Pain in the tail or lower back due to damage to the nerves (neuralgia), bones or soft tissues \r\n•Pain around the region of the tail including skin inflammation and infections, impacted or infected anal sacs or trauma \r\n•A learned response aimed at attracting owner attention. \r\n•Acute conflict\r\n•Compulsive Disorder \r\n•Stereotypy \r\n\r\nThese explanations are not independent and a dog who starts chasing his tail for one reason may subsequently learn to do it at other times in order to gain attention, or the frequent repetition of the behaviour may potentially result in neurological sensitization and the expression of the behaviour becoming emancipated from its original triggering stimuli. From the simple (and by no means definitive) list of differentials for tail chasing given above it should be obvious that underlying cognition can vary enormously with a given presenting stereotypic behaviour. This presentation considers the value but also limitations of using companion animals as models of human conditions and especially the value of using real world rather than laboratory models.",

The diagnosis of schizophrenia – schizoaffective type /schizoaffective disorder has been a part of the Diagnostic and statistical manual since the DSM-I. Even if the need for a diagnosis capturing this particular clinical picture obviously is needed, the agreement about when to use the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder as well as the diagnostic reliability is low. There is an agreement that the diagnosis covers episodes with an overlap between a psychotic episode meeting the A criteria for schizophrenia and a major mood episode where the psychotic symptoms continue after the end of the mood symptoms. Given the prevalence of depression in schizophrenia, some episodes, however, meet the criteria for schizoaffective disorders while others do not. The DSM-5 thus argues that the pattern of overlapping symptoms should be present in the majority of episodes.

      "abstract": "Synopsis An earlier paper documented that adverse experiences in childhood and adolescence considerably raise risk of both depressive and anxiety conditions (with the exception of mild agoraphobia and simple phobia) in adult life. This paper deals with the same inner-city women with children at home. Consideration of adverse experiences throughout adulthood as a whole (excluding the period just before onset) particularly involving major prior losses suggests that rather different aetiological processes may be involved. Depression appears to be often linked to experiences of major loss in adulthood as a whole and to be particularly susceptible to shortcomings in the quality of ongoing social support. For anxiety only early adverse experiences appeared to be critical. (However, the onset of both conditions is often provoked by a severely threatening event in the most recent period – particularly ‘loss’ in depression, and ‘danger’ in anxiety.) Finally the critical role of early experience for both anxiety and depression explains to a considerable extent why they so often occur together; and social factors not studied in the present enquiry may account for some of the remaining unexplained comorbidity.",

Research has shown that social isolation, an objective lack of contact with others, can lead to loneliness, mental health issues, and low life satisfaction. Leisure travel, which involves interactions with others, may have the potential to reduce social isolation.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

Vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, including depression, involves the interplay of genetic, biochemical, and psychosocial/environmental forces.\n\n2. The “core” symptoms of depression are the same for children and adults, but the prevalence of certain symptoms can vary with age.\n\n3. Evidence suggests that early-onset major depression is associated with especially high levels of psychiatric comorbidity, a protracted course, a poorer outcome, and a high probability of significant functional impairment.\n\n4. Suicide risk factors are common to a wide range of distressed children and adolescents and are not specific to suicide.\n\n5. There is no way to predict suicide among depressed children and adolescents, except in those who have made previous attempts.\n\nPediatricians are confronted daily with a wide array of psychosocial issues.Whether it’s the preschooler crying and complaining of stomach aches before leaving for child care, the young adolescent skipping school, or the older teenager abusing substances, pediatricians often are put in the difficult position of having to decide if problem behaviors and emotions are“ normal variations,” developmental transitions, temperamental manifestations, or primary symptoms of a serious psychiatric disorder. Mood disturbances and depressive states often represent a diagnostic dilemma to the primary care physician.\n\nSadness is common and is an appropriate response to loss (eg, death of a loved one), divorce, or separation. Although the initial sadness following loss may fade over time, children often revisit their sadness in later years. Normal adaptation involves a gradual acceptance of the loss and an incorporation of this reality into the child’s life experience. Some children will reconfigure the memory of the deceased through pictures or momentos in a process called memorialization. Other children (and adults) may carry on a silent dialogue with the deceased, trying to imagine how this person would have reacted at key times during the child’s life (eg, graduations, weddings).

      "title": "Low-Dose Clozapine for an Adolescent with TBI-Related Fregoli Delusions",
      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories. Distinguished scholastic achievement. No history of smoking or illicit drug use. No medical comorbidities. Had a history of MVA, 10 months ago, incurred severe TBI, admitt ed to ICU, discharged on prophylactic Valproate 1000 mg/d for posttraumatic seizures. He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment. He was seen by a private psychiatrist, a diagnosis of psychotic depression was entertained, and fluoxetine (Prozac",

      "abstract": "Suicidal behavior in psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, is not uncommon: About 10% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia are estimated to eventually commit suicide and even more will attempt it.1 Even Eugen Bleuler, who first coined the term schizophrenia at the beginning of the 20th century, had suggested that “the most serious of all schizophrenic symptoms is the suicidal drive.”2 However, despite its prevalence and seriousness, suicidal behavior in psychosis does not seem to be a major research focus and, while biological psychiatry has greatly advanced our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of suicidal behavior in a variety of disorders, there is little research into the actual experience or phenomenology of suicidal ideation and subsequent behavior in psychosis.\r\n\r\nSince I wrote my first article, my symptoms have remitted to such an extent that a firm diagnosis of schizophrenia can no longer be held in place, which has brought even more uncertainty to my condition. Nevertheless, certain symptoms—albeit far less florid than many of the positive symptoms I have had before—still linger in my mind. These include a never-ending sense of disintegration and fragmentation of the self and intrusive thoughts—which I think are an attenuated form of the voices I used to hear—urging me to throw my life away because a life without an active self is not worth living. At the same time, I am aware the very fact that I have a living body means I have a self, active or not, so if I killed myself the container for my real self would be lost forever. Still, the thoughts are correct in their own right, too. During this period of remission, I have realized that my whole life is full of contradiction, full of irreconcilable and irresolvable paradoxes which originate from my shattered self, beyond the realm of logic and reason. In this article, I would like to use my own experiences of psychosis in order to propose and analyze some of these paradoxes from a first-person perspective.",

      "title": "Special Considerations in Diagnosing and Treating Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder",
      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent chronic condition that affects people of all ages, including young children, school-aged children, adolescents, and adults. Symptoms can be noted as early as preschool age, tend to progress into functional impairment and behavioral problems in later childhood, and typically persist into adulthood. Contrary to previous belief, the disorder does not resolve with puberty for the majority of children; rather, the symptoms are manifested differently throughout the lifecycle. Presentation in adults is heavily biased toward inattentive symptoms, which are less likely to draw notice than hyperactive or impulsive symptoms and may contribute to the underrecognition of ADHD in this patient population. Diagnosis is particularly difficult due in large part to the pronounced comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in this patient population. Identification may be even more difficult in adults than children as the diagnostic criteria are not as clear, adults have difficulty remembering symptoms prior to 7 years of age, and there is a high prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in adults. Early identification and treatment of symptoms of ADHD in preschool-age children is essential to effective long-term management of the disorder. Both medication and behavioral treatments appear to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD, and evidence suggests that discontinuation of treatment leads to the reemergence of the condition. Efforts are currently continuing toward understanding the genetic underpinnings of ADHD. This expert review supplement will address the prevalence, comorbidity, treatment issues, and special considerations surrounding ADHD management throughout each stage of the lifecycle beginning with ADHD in preschool-aged children, continuing with school-aged children and adolescents, and ending with adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable psychiatric condition, that is, associated with lifelong distress and impairment. There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents. A comparative analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials in youth BD established that atypical antipsychotics have better efficacy and tolerability compared with anticonvulsants and lithium (effect size atypical antipsychotics 0.65, CI 0.53 to 0.78 vs …",

      "title": "Dissociative identity disorder: a disorder of diagnostic and therapeutic paradoxes",
      "abstract": "AbstractDissociative identity disorder (DID) is life-long, childhood-onset, posttraumatic developmental disorder where chronic early-life maltreatment and attachment disturbances prevents the child's development of a continuous sense of self across emotional states, relationships, and social contexts. As development proceeds, these self-states acquire a sense of themselves, a capacity for information processing, memory, emotion, and behavior. Conceptualizing DID involves paradoxes and apparent contradictions. DID has been categorized as a severe mental illness with major psychiatric comorbidities. Studies show that DID individuals have a unique personality organization with repeated, often covert posttraumatic reactivity, especially in relationships (e.g., therapy). Paradoxically, research shows that, during development, DID individuals preserve psychological resiliencies consistent with responsivity to long-term, psychodynamically informed treatment. These include, when not stressed, capacities for therapeutic alliance, reality testing, and observing ego.Keywords: Dissociative identity disordertraumaposttraumatic stress disordertransferencecountertransferencepsychoanalysisdevelopmental traumapsychological organization Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1. For simplicity, we will use the terms \"psychoanalytic' interchangeably with 'psychodynamic' in this paper, albeit not all psychodynamically oriented clinicians are psychoanalysts; and there are theoretical schisms among psychoanalytic/psychodynamic schools. Also, unless specifically noted, for simplicity and space considerations, we will use the term 'clinician', 'therapist', or 'practioner' to include clinicians, researchers, academicians, theorists, et al of any background or theoretical perspective.2. Therapists trained in hypnosis require additional training to work with trauma and dissociation in psychotherapy. Training in hypnosis for complex trauma and DDs is offered by the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis (https://www.asch.net/aws/ASCH/pt/sp/home_page).3. Disgust is summarized by drinking spoiled milk (yuk!); dissmell is smelling the spoiled mild before drinking it (pew).4. Self and identity are linked but distinct concepts. Self is our subjective 'I' and 'me', our moment-to-moment sense of our 'selves'. It is tied to our memory of our history, and that we can see ourselves in the future (autonoetic consciousness). Identity is more about our longer-term descriptors, some more internalized than others: sex, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, social class, profession, and many others. Identity can be negatively used against people in racist, sexist, and similar denigration of the 'other'. In DID, the secondary elaborations of the self-states are understood as identity enactments.5. Hypnotic inductions may begin by having the patient 'hyperfocus' on something (e.g., the place where 2 walls connect at the corner of the room). Often, this is followed by eye-closure as the patient enters hypnotic trance.6. The clinician must ascertain if the patient is currently in an abusive contemporary relationship (e.g., violent relationships; ongoing involvement with perpetrators, etc.), as the patient will see self-destructive behavior as a life-long necessity for survival. Helping trauma survivors exit abusive relationships is usually a long, grueling process that can be painful for the therapist to endure, as the patient repeatedly returns to be hurt, and new ways of coping are overwhelmed by more humiliating, controlling perpetration.7. It is recommended that terms like 'child pornography', 'child prostitution' be replaced by more descriptive terms as the former may imply some active involvement by exploited, trafficked child.8. The notion of 'continuous memory' is itself problematic since we do not continually remember our autobiography. This is among the many terminological issues in this area that are outside the scope of this paper (e.g., 'recovered memory'; one can say all memories are 'recovered'). The intrapsychic process of dissociation is different from that of 'repression'; large blocks of experience are unavailable in dissociation, not relatively singular memories. The subjective experience of delayed recall is different, and is often accompanied by intense emotions at minimum, and more often frank PTSD intrusive symptoms.9. A real-world example of this mixture of good and evil is that of Daniel Gadjusek who won the Nobel Prize for medicine for his work on what are now called prion diseases. However, he used his research site in New Guinea to bring back and adopt over 50 young boys, many of whom he sexually abused and trafficked among his friends. Goudsmit (Citation2009).

The illness often includes positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations), negative symptoms (social withdrawal, avolition), and a disorganized thought process. Currently there are no definitive tests or biomarkers for schizophrenia, so the medical workup should focus on excluding neurologic, metabolic, infectious, autoimmune, and other causes of psychosis. Brain imaging is not routinely performed. The most important goals of the emergency department evaluation are to assess for safety and to engage the patient in treatment. Framing the treatment plan around the patient’s own goals can facilitate engagement. Antipsychotic medication usually improves positive symptoms. Medication selection is based on the side-effect profile; olanzapine is not recommended for patients with a first episode of psychosis due to high rates of metabolic side effects. While not all patients will want to discuss the diagnosis, clinicians should be prepared for this conversation, especially if it will facilitate engagement.",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterized by persistent deficits in communication/social interaction and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. It is usually identified in childhood, despite late diagnoses in cases of greater functionality. Havighurst proposes a set of fundamental tasks throughout the life cycle, whose achievement is probably compromised in the ASD, even though it lacks scientific evidence. This study innovates, as it is based on Havighurst&amp;#039;s theoretical model for understanding the development process of three adults and one young person, diagnosed with ASD level I, at different life stages. Through the methodology of life histories, interviews were subject to content analysis. Results pointed out the early detection and interventions importance, minimizing adversities, above all by those who had late diagnoses. Self-perceived success, not expected, was found in some development tasks (e.g. conscience and morality development). Also were noticed expected limitations related to ASD (e.g. difficulties in relationships with peers and in the labor market inclusion). Probably, in cases of greater severity and less functionality/autonomy, there would be greater failure in development tasks. It is crucial to improve research on this developmental model and on the factors that delay the diagnosis, including cases of different levels of severity.",

The psychological and social impact of AIDS may result in psychiatric symptoms similar to those seen in other life-threatening diseases, including anxiety, depression, and delirium. Neurologic complications are frequent, the commonest being an encephalopathy and dementia that is poorly understood. It is difficult in the early stages of AIDS to separate reactive depression and psychomotor retardation from symptoms associated with central nervous system complications. Guidelines are needed to manage the psychological problems posed by AIDS and its related conditions.",

      "title": "The relationship between Stigma and Self-Efficacy in individuals with epilepsy or nonepileptic attack disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nStigma is when a certain characteristic (such as weight or race) causes an individual or group to be treated negatively based on a feature that differentiates them from other members of society. Stigma can be considered in different ways; Stigma can be ‘enacted’, when the individual is directly discriminated against, and ‘perceived’, when individual believes the negative actions of others to be linked to an undesirable characteristic of their self. Stigma can have serious consequences, such as reduced quality of life, lower rates of employment and less overall life satisfaction. \r\nEpilepsy is a reasonably common neurological disorder where individuals experience seizures. Over 500,000 UK residents are estimated to be affected by Epilepsy. It can be caused by a number of different factors, such as brain lesions, but there may be no known cause for up to two-thirds of individuals with epilepsy. Historically, seizures have been associated with negative factors, such as demonic possession, and have experienced stigma. There is also evidence that stigmatising attitudes towards seizures continue to be prevalent. Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) is a condition whereby an individual experiences seizures that are outwardly similar to epileptic seizures. These seizures, however, are not associated with the neurological correlates of epilepsy. NEAD is a fairly common disorder with an estimated 15 000 UK residents receiving a diagnosis. The causes of NEAD are often considered psychological rather than physical and, as such, NEAD is often considered a mental health disorder. \r\nThe causes and manifestations of stigma in NEAD are unclear. This project aimed to extend the current understanding of stigma in NEAD by first: reviewing the literature on the experiences of stigma for NEAD and second: investigating the possible underlying factors that may cause perceived stigma in NEAD compared to epilepsy.\r\nPart I describes the outcomes of a systematic narrative review that identified 22 papers investigating the experiences of stigma by individuals diagnosed with NEAD. The results indicate that individuals with NEAD experience stigma from healthcare professionals, the public, and family and friends. Some evidence suggests that individuals with NEAD experience higher rates of stigma than epilepsy. \r\nPart II presents a cross-sectional study that investigate the relationship between perceived stigma and self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and seizure symptom severity in 2 groups (epilepsy and NEAD). The study found individuals with NEAD report more perceived stigma than those with epilepsy and higher, clinical, levels of depression. The severity of symptoms was not associated with perceived stigma for NEAD but it was with epilepsy. Depression was significant predictive factor for perceived stigma in both epilepsy and NEAD.\r\nThese studies develop the current understanding of stigma in NEAD and epilepsy. The findings suggest individuals with NEAD experience more stigma than those with Epilepsy and that depression predicts perceived stigma for other groups. The findings also suggest that stigma may be a useful target for future interventions for individuals with NEAD.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric rehabilitation of the chronically mentally ill requires conceptual distinction among psychological abnormalities of the nervous system, representing active pathology or a disease state; impairment of functions by means of which those abnormalities can be inferred; disabilities, i.e., losses of functional ability consequent upon an impairment; and handicaps, which are the social disadvantages resulting from disability [1-3]. These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

Since the hypochondriac's flooding, but unsymbolized, anxiety is so prevalent, hypochondria has been historically classified as one of the types of actual neurosis, a term used by Freud to include intense physical and emotional states. The intricate relation between hypochondriac anxiety and excessive daydreaming has important implications for our clinical work. Even in otherwise relatively well functioning personalities, the hypochondriac involvement with the body might become so extensive that, at its extremity.

      "title": "Impact of Cognitive Behavior Therapy on Anxiety and Depression in Adolescent Students",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAnxiety and depressive disorders in adolescents were thought to be relatively rare and low impact conditions. As a result, our empirical knowledge about adolescent anxiety and depression is less extensive than it is for the adult conditions. When adolescents suffer from a severe anxiety disorder their thinking, decision-making ability, perceptions of the environment, learning and concentration get affected. They not only experience fear, nervousness, and shyness but also start avoiding places and pleasurable activities. Anxiety also raises blood pressure and heart rate and can cause nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, ulcers, diarrhea, tingling, weakness, and shortness of breath.Other symptoms can be seen in adolescents who are suffering from anxiety are frequent self-doubt and self-criticism, irritability, sleep problems and in extreme cases, thoughts of not wanting to be alive. If these adolescents are left untreated, they may face risks such as poor results at academic activities, avoidance of important social activities, and substance abuse. Adolescents who suffer from an anxiety disorders are likely to suffer other psychological disorders such as depression, eating disorders, attention deficit disorders both hyperactive and inattentive, and obsessive compulsive disorders (Ipser et al., 2009).Depression can be viewed as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel in this way at one time or another for short periods. Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which we could see a feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of time (Ballas, 2009).Adolescents who are having depression could experience feelings of emptiness, anxiety, loneliness, helplessness, guilt, loss of confidence and self-esteem and changes in sleeping and eating habits. In addition to these they often act out. That is, they always try to cover their depression by acting angry, aggressive, running away or becoming delinquent (Verma and Saraswathi, 2002).Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a popular psychotherapeutic approach, which aims to alleviate distress by modifying cognitive content and process, realigning thinking with reality (Longmore and Worrell, 2008). Cognitive Behavioural therapists identify and treat difficulties arising from an individual's irrational thinking, misperceptions, dysfunctional thoughts and faulty learning. CBT includes cognitive techniques as well as behavioural components. The former emphasizes on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and maladaptive beliefs while the latter involves graded task assignments, pleasant events scheduling as well as other skills training such as relaxation skills, communication skills, assertiveness skills and problem solving skills (Soloman & Haaga, 2004).METHODObjectives1. The main objective was to study the Impact of Cognitive Behavior Therapy on Anxiety and Depression in adolescents.2. To study the impact of Cognitive Behavior Therapy on gender difference with regard to Anxiety and Depression in adolescents.Participants380 adolescent students from different schools and Pre University colleges in Bengaluru Rural and Tumakuru, Karnataka, were administered with Beck's Anxiety Inventory and Beck's Depression Inventory-II. Finally 120 adolescents were selected who scored high on Anxiety and Depression. They were randomly assigned to Experimental Group and Control Group with 30 boys and 30 girls in each group. CBT intervention was given to the experimental group and no intervention was given to the control group.MeasuresBeck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI), by Aaron T Beck (1990):The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), created by Aaron T. Beck, and colleagues, is a 21-item multiple-choice self-report inventory that measures the severity of an anxiety in adults and adolescents. Each symptom item has four possible answer choices: Not at All; Mildly (It did not bother me much); Moderately (It was very unpleasant, but I could stand it), and, Severely (I could barely stand it). …",

      "abstract": "In the perinatal period, fathers may also suffer from depression, referred to as paternal perinatal depression. Studies have shown that the prevalence of paternal perinatal depression is considerably higher than in the general adult population. For example, a meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression among fathers was 9.76% during the prenatal period and 8.75% during the postpartum year.1 Paternal perinatal depression can deteriorate the marital relationship and generate psychosocial and behavioral problems in the offspring (Ramchandani et al., 2021).2 However, paternal perinatal depression has received comparatively little clinical attention. A review of the literature on this subject will list the biological, psychological and social risk factors for this condition, which include a history of depression or anxiety disorders, lack of social support, conflicts in the couple's relationship, economic and labor problems. The clinical characteristics of depression share similarities with depressions in other periods of life, and there are differential clinical features, such as anger, aggressiveness, somatic symptoms and greater comorbidity with substance abuse disorder. Early detection with scales such as the Edinburgh, Gotland and PAPA and the appropriate approach are fundamental to mitigate the effects of paternal perinatal depression. Psychotherapeutic support, psychoeducation of the disorder, and self-care tools can be part of a comprehensive approach to help parents experiencing this condition. In conclusion, the proposal to include this disorder within the parental perinatal affective disorders, as proposed by the author Baldoni,3 given the level of overlap that it usually has with other comorbid conditions (anxiety, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders) and high frequency of masked symptoms, goes in the direction to give the attention it deserves for early detection and provide adequate support and treatment.",

The behavioral phenotype for Williams syndrome is characterized by a distinctive cognitive profile and an unusual personality profile. Relative to overall level of intellectual ability, individuals with Williams syndrome typically show a clear strength in auditory rote memory, a strength in language, and an extreme weakness in visuospatial construction. The personality of individuals with Williams syndrome involves high sociability, overfriendliness, and empathy, with an undercurrent of anxiety related to social situations. The adaptive behavior profile for Williams syndrome involves clear strength in socialization skills (especially interpersonal skills related to initiating social interaction), strength in communication, and clear weakness in daily living skills and motor skills, relative to overall level of adaptive behavior functioning. Literature relevant to each of the components of the Williams syndrome behavioral phenotype is reviewed, including operationalizations of the Williams syndrome cognitive profile and the Williams syndrome personality profile. The sensitivity and specificity of these profiles for Williams syndrome, relative to individuals with other syndromes or mental retardation or borderline normal intelligence of unknown etiology, is considered. The adaptive behavior profile is discussed in relation to the cognitive and personality profiles. The importance of operationalizations of crucial components of the behavioral phenotype for the study of genotype/phenotype correlations in Williams syndrome is stressed.

The behavioral phenotype for Williams syndrome is characterized by a distinctive cognitive profile and an unusual personality profile. Relative to overall level of intellectual ability, individuals with Williams syndrome typically show a clear strength in auditory rote memory, a strength in language, and an extreme weakness in visuospatial construction. The personality of individuals with Williams syndrome involves high sociability, overfriendliness, and empathy, with an undercurrent of anxiety related to social situations. The adaptive behavior profile for Williams syndrome involves clear strength in socialization skills (especially interpersonal skills related to initiating social interaction), strength in communication, and clear weakness in daily living skills and motor skills, relative to overall level of adaptive behavior functioning. Literature relevant to each of the components of the Williams syndrome behavioral phenotype is reviewed, including operationalizations of the Williams syndrome cognitive profile and the Williams syndrome personality profile. The sensitivity and specificity of these profiles for Williams syndrome, relative to individuals with other syndromes or mental retardation or borderline normal intelligence of unknown etiology, is considered. The adaptive behavior profile is discussed in relation to the cognitive and personality profiles. The importance of operationalizations of crucial components of the behavioral phenotype for the study of genotype/phenotype correlations in Williams syndrome is stressed.

      "abstract": "Mr. X is a Swiss patient with Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome clinically and genetically diagnosed at the age of 28. He is also known to have severe intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy since the age of 18. At the age of 30, he was admitted for the first time to a psychiatric crisis unit dedicated to mental disabilities for challenging behavior such as self-aggression (forceful vomiting, scratching himself, pulling out his toe and fingernails or banging his head against the wall), agitation, screaming, dropping to the ground, damaging electronic items, or even displaying hetero-aggressive gestures (trying to bite or pull hair, scratching, kicking, or punching) associated with a drop in mood, withdrawal from usual activities, a drop in social interaction and a tendency to doze off during the day. The introduction of Pregabalin leads to rapid stabilization of the clinical state, almost complete improvement in challenging behavior and gradual withdrawal of other treatments (class 2 analgesics, neuroleptics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines). At the neurological check-up 9 months after discharge from hospital, clinical stability was confirmed by the surrounding team and the medical observation, with almost complete disappearance of auto-aggressive gestures.",

      "abstract": "Many conditions in psychiatry cannot be separated from normality/healthy states (e.g. depression) but even these broad diagnostic constructs may include syndromes like melancholia. There is still a debate as to whether psychotic-like experiences in the community are on a continuum with psychotic symptoms in those meeting diagnostic criteria for psychosis diagnostic constructs. Schizophrenia may exist on a continuum with related conditions (e.g. schizotypal personality disorder). There are differences between people meeting criteria for schizophrenia and healthy controls but none that can be used as a diagnostic test to separate the two, with the possible exception of anomalous self-experiences differentiating schizophrenia spectrum conditions from healthy controls and other diagnostic constructs. Several general medical conditions also exist on a continuum with health with no zones of rarity (e.g. hypertension and type 2 diabetes). Thresholds to meet criteria for these diagnostic constructs are chosen by expert committees often based on risk of developing complications (e.g. myocardial infarctions) and/or whether medical intervention may be beneficial. Even reasonably objective investigations can give abnormal results in healthy people. Concerns about whether thresholds are too low, leading to over-diagnosis, unnecessary treatment, and iatrogenic harm, also exist in general medicine. Other classifications in mental health will need to use thresholds in order to fulfil functions such as administration, research, or access to services. Dimensional classifications are good at representing the many spectrums of mental health.",

      "abstract": "The predominantly inattentive (IN) subtype of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a recently defined condition that is often overlooked by professionals and is still not completely understood. Characterized by symptoms of inattentiveness, such as distractibility, failure to complete work, forgetfulness, and disorganization, the IN subtype differs from the more commonly recognized combined (CB) subtype of ADHD in that symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity are absent or minimal. Large-scale epidemiologic studies suggest that the IN subtype is at least as prevalent as the CB subtype, and is at least as likely to be associated with academic and/or social impairment. Diagnosis of the IN subtype, however, may be more challenging because in addition to inattentiveness, other symptoms, including learning problems, depression, and anxiety, may also present without externalizing behaviors. Several studies have shown that compared with the CB subtype, the IN subtype has a later age of onset and referral, a relatively larger proportion of affected females, and is much less likely to be associated with symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Research is currently under way to examine the cognitive characteristics of the IN subtype and its genetic and neurobiologic underpinnings, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and other treatments.",

      "title": "Chronic Psychosis in Dual Disorder Heroin Use Disorder Patients",
      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder, manic or depressive episodes and mixed states are frequently marked by psychotic symptoms. Moreover, psychosis may occur after substance use disorder, often intervening with the effect of making the clinical picture indistinguishable from that of a primary psychosis. Cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, alcohol and poly-use most commonly develop psychosis induced by the non-medical use of substances. Among substance use disorder users, it has not yet been ascertained whether opioids exert a psychotic effect. Still, some authors have supported the view that opioids have antidepressant, antipanic and antipsychotic effects. It has also been hypothesized that affective disorders, coupled with genetic disposition rather than affective disturbance or psychosis, result in bipolar psychosis or schizoaffective disorder, respectively. In the history of chronic psychotics, heroin use is relatively infrequent. Chronic use of psychotogenic substances and autonomous chronicity of psychotic symptoms may root in a bipolar substrate. Substance use among people with schizophrenia cannot always be justified in terms of dysphoria. Still, the number of depressive symptoms can significantly influence the risk rate for alcohol, cannabinoid use or poly-use. Dual disorder psychotic heroin-addicted patients usually enter treatment with more severe psychopathological aspects and a shorter, less severe addiction history than their non-psychotic peers suggesting that these patients are likely to benefit from opioid medication. These data indirectly confirm the antipsychotic effects of opioids and Khantzian's self-medication hypothesis. For further confirmation, patients affected by chronic psychosis and anxiety disorders tend to progress from a psychiatric disorder to a substance use disorder. In contrast, patients with mood disorders are initially affected by drug addiction. As far as dual disorder is concerned, it is advisable to employ agents that do not heavily affect dopamine metabolism in an inhibitory way since the worsening of use hampers the effectiveness upon psychotic symptoms. On the other hand, when the tie with substances is more robust, their use may amplify as a direct consequence of dopamine antagonism, as a compensatory mechanism effective throughout the reward pathway. Novel antipsychotics seem to permit equivalent effectiveness on psychotic symptoms without promoting drug use, at least to the same extent, and might have anticraving properties.",

      "title": "M6. REDUCED READINESS POTENTIAL AS A NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE OF SELF-DISTURBANCES IN EARLY–COURSE PSYCHOSIS: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A HIGH–DENSITY EEG STUDY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Self-disturbances reflect a core dimension of Schizophrenia that can be identified before disease onset and might underlie the development of typical psychotic symptoms. The Sense of Agency (SoA) can be conceptualized as the pre-reflective sensation of being the one who is causing or generating an action or thought. Passivity phenomena, such as the reported feeling and belief that one’s thoughts or actions are generated and/or controlled by an external agent, are exquisite examples of SoA disturbances observed in Schizophrenia. Despite intensive research, the neurobiological pathogenetic mechanisms underlying such disturbances remain unclear. Among several putative neurophysiological brain abnormalities, a reduction of the Bereitschaftspotential, also called pre-motor or Readiness Potential (RP), was described in chronic, medicated patients with Schizophrenia. Given its anticipation of voluntary movement by 1 – 2 seconds over the motor cortex and supplementary motor area contralateral to the effector, RP has previously been proposed to be a neural signature of volition to initiate movement. Interestingly, higher RPs among healthy subjects have been recently associated with stronger intentional binding, suggesting increased SoA in subjects exhibiting stronger premovement activity. The objective of our work was to study RP abnormalities in patients with a psychotic illness of recent onset and to relate them to self disturbances, in order to clarify the relationship between known neurophysiological and psychopathological abnormalities. Methods We employed high-density electroencephalography (64-channel BrainAmp, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) to record scalp potentials during a self-paced movement task in a group of seven early–course psychosis patients (mean age = 24,5, range 20–33) and an equal group of age– and gender– matched (mean age =25,3, range 19 – 36) healthy control subjects. Patients were recruited during an acute stage of their disorder requiring hospitalization and were treated with low–dose atypical antipsychotics. Exclusion criteria included major medical or neurological illness affecting the CNS and any intellectual developmental disorder. Several parameters related to the elicited RP were recorded, including maximum amplitude and slope. The Examination of Anomalous Self Experience (EASE) scale was chosen to assess Self disturbances in the patient group by an experienced clinician who was blind to the neurophysiological outcome. Results RP was found to be reduced in patients, compared to healthy control subjects, in both its amplitude and slope (p &amp;lt; 0,005) despite comparable EMG activity. EASE scores of items ‘EASE-10’ (a comprehensive item that reflect most prototypically the disorders of self-experience) and ‘EASE-2’ (“Self-Awareness”) appeared to increase monotonically with the decrease of RP slope (p &amp;lt; 0,05). Discussion Our preliminary data show that disturbances of RP are present since the early course of psychotic disorders. They also suggest that such abnormalities may reflect the severity of self-disturbances in these patients. If confirmed in a larger, medication-naïve samples, our findings might clarify the underlying neural mechanisms of such abnormalities and provide a solid basis for further investigation of RP disturbances as an early biological marker for Schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",

Anyone can have such concerns for a time, but when it becomes a pervasive and enduring feature of one's way of dealing with the world, then this can constitute a paranoid personality disorder. Among mental health disciplines, there is consensual agreement reflected in the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM; the gold standard for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders) that a personality disorder is an enduring, inflexible pattern of behavior across a broad range of functional contexts that produces either clinically significant personal distress or disruption and impairment in a person's social, occupational, or “other important areas of functioning” (APA, 2000). The prevalence of paranoid personality disorder (PPD) has been estimated to range from 0.5–2.5% in the general population, to be four times more prevalent in outpatient psychiatric settings, and to occur 10–30% in inpatient psychiatric facilities (APA, 2000). It is also thought to be more prevalent among males. Though it is a comparatively uncommon condition, its impact can be pervasive. Many would agree that dramatic examples in history of paranoid personalities include Joseph Stalin and perhaps Saddam Hussein.",

It is particularly common within lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations given the difficulties of confronting and accepting the self. Using a clinical case experienced by a psychiatry resident trainee as a framework, this paper explores the phenomenon of shame as a common pathway to several psychiatric diagnoses within the same patient.

      "title": "Dissociative Pathways to Homicide: Clinical and Forensic Implications",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT ABSTRACT In a earlier review, dissociation was found to be linked to violence in a wide range of populations, including college students, young mothers, psychiatric patients, and criminal offenders, and was often expressed in the violent act itself, in the form of depersonalization or subsequent amnesia (Moskowitz, 2004). While that review focused on “state” dissociation–i.e., dissociation during an act of violence, this paper looks at links between “trait” dissociation and violence–evidence that long-term dissociative processes may predispose vulnerable individuals to violent behavior, and even homicide. Specifically, it is argued that dissociation is related to the development of four “types” (probably not mutually exclusive) of homicide offenders: (1) violent individuals suffering from dissociative identity disorder, whose violence is expressed through certain dissociated personality states, (2) fantasy-driven violence, often accompanied by some form of identity alteration, (3) paroxysms of “dissociative rage” in individuals normally presenting as polite or meek, characterized as “overcontrolled hostile” (Megargee, 1966), and (4) persons designated as psychopathic, whose emotional numbing may be trauma-based and similar to that seen in depersonalization disorder. While the last three areas are somewhat speculative, research findings supporting each proposed link are presented. In conjunction with Moskowitz (2004), this review strongly suggests a significant role for dissociation not only in the commission of certain violent acts, but also in the development of some violent individuals; the clinical and forensic implications of this are discussed. Further research systematically exploring the role of dissociative processes in violent and homicidal behavior is called for. KEYWORDS: Dissociationpsychopathyhomicidefantasydepersonalization",

While ToM deficits are more pronounced in the acute phase of illness, it seems to persist during periods of remission. There is also evidence of ToM deficits in the healthy relatives of schizophrenics, patients with delusional disorder and bipolar disorder (BD), and individuals with high schizotypy scores. ToM dysfunction might be secondary to other cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia that have a good prognosis, asymptomatic schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and BD. Other cognitive deficits do not seem to explain ToM dysfunction in patients with psychosis and severe negative symptoms. These findings support the contribution of impairment in both domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms to ToM deficits in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. ToM deficits may be important for understanding poor social functioning and poor insight in psychotic disorders.While ToM is influenced by state variables, it might be an endophenotype of schizophrenia; however, ToM is likely to be an indicator of other frontal lobe-related endophenotypes. Longitudinal studies conducted with high-risk individuals are particularly important.",

      "abstract": "Here we report on a case of a 40-year-old female patient who presented with hypomanic episode after hyperthyroidism and major depressive episode after hypothyroidism, which was initially misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder due to another medical condition, and was found to be a co-morbid bipolar disorder of hyperthyroidism after treatment and follow-up. The course of diagnosis and treatment in this case suggests a close temporal relationship does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship on a physiologic level. User's Guide for the SCID-5-CV Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders elaborate that the diagnosis of \"……due to another medical condition\" is relatively rare, and co-morbidity between psychiatric disorders and somatic diseases is much more common. Therefore, the relationship between somatic diseases and psychiatric disorders requires careful study of symptom correlation and more time for observational follow-up. When in doubt, the examiner's default assumption should be that the somatic disease is not the cause (i.e., the psychiatric disorder is primary).",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

As part of an ongoing genetic linkage study of schizophrenia, the authors examined case material from 50 relatives (of schizophrenia probands) who received a DSM-III-R diagnosis of a nonaffective psychotic disorder or schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder. Eleven exhibited episodic or chronic delusions that resulted in diagnostic dilemmas, often arising from issues pertaining to the classification of delusional phenomena. Four of these cases are presented here. Unusual beliefs were often difficult to classify as odd beliefs versus full delusions, brief/transient versus persistent delusions, bizarre versus non-bizarre delusions.

      "title": "Cariprazine treatment of borderline personality disorder: A case report",
      "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is an often debilitating psychiatric condition characterized by mood instability, cognitive symptoms, impulsive behavior, and disturbed relationships.1 Although dialectical behavioral therapy has been shown to reduce the symptoms of BPD, finding trained psychologists can be challenging, and not all patients are able to tolerate it.2, 3 Research on the use of medication is ongoing, but no drug has yet been approved in the USA or elsewhere for BPD's treatment.4 Here we report a case of a patient with BPD who was treated with cariprazine, which is FDA-approved medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. The person described in this case signed a consent authorizing publication, and personal details have been changed to maintain his privacy and keep his identity unknown. In the universities where the authors work, no ethics approval is needed for the use of off-label medications and publication of such cases, particularly where there is no FDA-approved treatment option. Mr F, aged 42 years, is a divorced man who presented with his sister at a university medical research center for treatment of BPD. Mr F reported that since adolescence he had struggled with maintaining friendships and intimate relationships. He reported that he would become enamored of people very quickly and very intensely and would then feel that they had disappointed him. This in turn would lead to feelings of rage and depression. Inevitability the anger outbursts would result in his loss of the friendship or relationship. In addition, he reported severe anxiety and episodic dissociation. In his 20s, he had drunk alcohol excessively to cope with the anxiety but since achieving sobriety 12 years ago, he had had more difficulties dealing with the anxiety. He had found that instead of drinking alcohol, he had become reckless in his driving, his sexual behaviors, and his spending. Despite these behaviors, Mr F. described a chronic feeling of emptiness. Furthermore, he reported a chronic problem with low self-esteem, despite external evidence to the contrary, such as success in developing his own business. His score on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder was 18, indicating moderate illness severity. Previous treatment had included 12 months of weekly dialectical behavioral therapy (individual and group therapy) with some modest benefit. In addition, he had received a trial of olanzapine (up to 15 mg/day for 12 weeks) with some slight benefit but excessive weight gain had caused him to discontinue the medication. At the time of presentation, Mr F was not taking any medications. Psychiatric assessment found that he met the DSM-5 criteria for BPD. Included in the differential was major depressive disorder with mixed features as well as bipolar disorder. These two were ruled out clinically as the patterns of interpersonal problems that Mr F had described had been ongoing for years and the mood symptoms were triggered by interpersonal conflicts. After discussion about the diagnosis and the off-label use of the medication, Mr F consented to medication treatment. Treatment with cariprazine began with 3 mg once every day. After 2 weeks, Mr F reported that he felt less 'moody' and the dose was increased to 4.5 mg/day. Due to some improvement in anger, it was again raised to 6 mg/day after 3 weeks. After 2 months at the 6-mg/day dose, Mr F. reported less anxiety, less moodiness, and, most strikingly, no anger outbursts and no impulsive behaviors. In fact, he stated that he 'no longer wakes up angry' and has no urges to engage in his previous reckless behaviors. Seven months later, his score on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder scale was 8 and notably he scored 0 on the questions regarding anger and impulsive behaviors. He denied any adverse effects from taking cariprazine. Although the neurobiology of BPD is not well understood, it appears to involve dysfunctions in the serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems.5, 6 Cariprazine is a dopamine D3 receptor and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist and thus may be uniquely situated to assist with the mood symptoms as well as the reward processing in BPD.7 In a meta-analysis of data from the treatment of other disorders (psychosis, bipolar disorder, and depression), risk of discontinuation due to adverse events with cariprazine was similar to placebo.8 The meta-analysis found that cariprazine was associated with increased risk of extrapyramidal side-effects and weight gain compared to placebo.8 This case report suggests that cariprazine merits consideration as a candidate treatment option for BPD that should be evaluated in future controlled trials. It may prove to be a potentially beneficial treatment for this disabling personality disorder in some patients.

      "title": "Mood and affect",
      "abstract": "Readers are grateful to Macpherson and Hikida1 for helping us understand the role of the basal ganglia in various mental disorders. In listing the symptoms of major depressive disorder, they mention, ‘low mood (also known as “flat affect”).’ This is a common mistake. Low mood refers to the feeling/internal emotional state of the individual – it is a symptom. It is a subjective matter and if the individual states that his/her mood is low, we are obliged to accept that assessment (we might, of course, comment that the signs are or are not consistent with the statement). The term ‘affect,’ when used in the assessment of the mental state, refers to the external manifestations of an internal feeling state – here, affect is a sign. (The term ‘affect’ is also sometimes used as an alternative to ‘mood,’ as is ‘affective disorders,’ but this is archaic and not much used currently.) The term ‘flat affect’ was coined to describe a sign of chronic schizophrenia. This largely refers to the unvarying immobile face and slow-moving body often associated with a loss (or absence) of emotional experience/life. It is a negative symptom. But ‘flat’ here is not interchangeable with ‘low’ – the important additional aspect is that the external manifestation does not vary. Where there is flat affect it is usually difficult to get an emotional response (reciprocal emotional response) from the patient. The face and behavior of the individual with a low mood may be similar, at times, to that of the person with schizophrenia with negative symptoms. However, the underlying processes are different. In one there is low mood, in the other there is absence of emotion. The external features (affect) associated with low mood revert to normal when the mood disorder resolves. The flat affect of schizophrenia changes little in response to treatment. Low mood and flat affect are distinct entities – ‘mood’ refers to subjective experience and ‘affect’ refers to objective evidence. Low mood is not always accompanied by psychomotor retardation (which limits facial and bodily movement) and the flat affect of schizophrenia may not be accompanied by low mood. The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.",

      "abstract": "Therapeutic social environments contribute to the successful treatment and rehabilitation for patients with schizophrenia. However, social stigmata of psychiatric disorder in our society have kept away schizophrenic patients from their recovery and adaptation. Many persons have thought that psychiatric patients are more violent and criminal because of overwhelming prejudice on untreated or mistreated patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this review is to propose the new and updated fundamentals of our knowledge on the relationship between schizophrenia and violence. In 1980s, many researchers have a belief that rates of criminal behavior vary independently on the rates of mental disorders. The following scientific studies on various population and metaanalyses of relevant data, overall violence rate have been higher in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders than in healthy controls. Even though schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are associated with increased risk of homicide, the association has been not attributed to the psychopathology limited to schizophrenia. Most of all, co-occurrence of substance abuse has played an important role in increasing the possibility of violent behavior. The severe violent offending has been inclined to occur during the early period of psychotic episode before beginning the psychiatric treatment. Thus, most of the violent offending of schizophrenia patient can be prevented by prompt therapeutic interventions and treatments. (Korean J Schizophr Res 2015;18:10-15)",

Onset is insidious, idiopathic, and hastened by neurological incident or infection. Typically, the initial onset occurs during the teen years or after the second decade, although cases have been documented in early childhood, adulthood, and senescence. KLS is marked by unexpected debilitating, yet reversible, episodic hypersomnia, with varying recurrence rates; cognitive and behavioral impairment; compulsive eating; and feelings of derealization, hypersexuality, apathy, and depressed mood. Diagnosis is problematic due to the syndrome's rarity, disparity of presenting clinical symptoms, and misdiagnosis. Correct diagnosis can take up to 4 years. The clinical course is approximately 8 to 14 years from initial onset, yet may be longer in the adult form of the disorder. KLS has been shown to impact activities of daily living, usurping an adolescent of his/her social relations with peers, experiences, and time.

An alternative, dimensional approach assumes that psychotic symptoms are continuous with normal experiences and are not necessarily associated with disability. Evidence for a continuum of psychosis comes from studies showing that the core symptoms of psychosis, delusions and hallucinations, are much more prevalent in the general population than their clinical counterparts. These milder forms of expression of psychosis show similar patterns of associations with demographic and environmental risk factors as the clinical disorder, providing further support for the notion of continuity. Although the majority of individuals experiencing these lesser psychotic “symptoms” are not in need of care, they may nevertheless have an increased risk of developing a clinical disorder. Transitions over the psychosis continuum may in part be driven by the cognitive and emotional response to the psychotic or psychosislike experiences.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders and a notably heterogeneous condition with regard to etiology, symptom expression, course, and treatment response. This is why it is extremely unlikely that a “one size fits all” approach to the treatment of depression will be particularly effective. Quite the contrary, it is clear that the future of the treatment of depression may lie in a combined disorder- and person-centred, tailored-made approach, which takes into account the broader interpersonal context and life history of the individual. Depressed patients with a characteristic cognitive-affective schema of self-critical perfectionism are prone to typical dysfunctional transactional cycles or dominant interpersonal narratives in which rage, distrust and ambivalence are apparent. In addition to this, in these subtype of depressed patients is common to find the overuse of attachment deactivating strategies, in response to threats to attachment relationships specially, and the inhibition of mentalizing as a defensive response to the feelings of rage, emptiness and sadness that are developmentally linked to attachment experiences. The implications of these findings for treatment, particularly with regard to the nature of the therapeutic relationship, are readily important. In this poster we take several cases in order to detail the main psychodynamics and the dominant interpersonal narratives of this subtype of depressed patients and to specify a therapeutic proposal tailored for them.

Conclusiones. En la actualidad, los adultos estan infradiagnosticados al considerarse durante mucho tiempo que el TDAH era propio de ninos y adolescentes; sus manifestaciones clinicas, aun en lo basico similares a las de los ninos, son distintas con presentaciones diferentes. No existen pruebas biomedicas que permitan un diagnostico objetivo, por lo que la historia clinica que evalue los posibles sintomas desde la infancia, los signos y sintomas tipicos y las posibles comorbilidades que han se ser resenadas, debe ser realizada meticulosamente.

      "title": "The conundrum of the connection between severe psychiatric disorders and dementia",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Psychiatric disorders have been recognized as important risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, especially dementia. The strength of association varies among different psychiatric conditions, being more pronounced in severe mental illnesses, i.e., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Multiple mechanisms seem to underlie this association, such as high prevalence of cardiovascular and other physical morbidities, poor lifestyle choices, and accelerated aging, including ‘inflammaging’. They all represent opportunities for intervention, but it is still unclear whether current therapeutic approaches for psychiatric disorders can prevent the development of dementia. Other knowledge gaps include whether the risk of dementia applies to all patients with a certain condition, or if subgroups of patients are more vulnerable than others, whether different types of dementia are linked to specific psychiatric disorders.",

During a three- to four-year prospective follow-up, 4% had developed bipolar I, 14% bipolar II, and 22% unipolar disorders with predominantly favorable social outcome. Most of the remainder were suffering from nonaffective disorders; in this group, intermittent depressive symptomatology followed a protacted course (paralleling the underlying disorder) with generally unfavorable outcome. Irrespective of diagnostic subtype, a \"characterological\" component occurring in 24% of the total sample appeared to predict unfavorable prognosis, including three suicides. The diagnostic usage of the concept of neurotic depression may no longer be clinically meaningful, since it lacks sufficient phenomenological characterization and refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders. The data suggest the merits of a biaxial approach to the nosology of depressive disorders whereby phenomenologically based affective diagnoses are qualified as to the presence or absence of character disorder.",

      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlexia is the phenomenon of spontaneous and precocious mastery of single‐word reading that has been of interest to clinicians and researchers since the beginning of the last century. Methods: An extensive search of publications on the subject of hyperlexia was undertaken and all available publications were reviewed. Results: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) whether hyperlexia should be defined through single‐word reading superiority with regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6) whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability (talent). Conclusions: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single‐word reading in the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a discrepancy between levels of single‐word reading and comprehension). We simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi‐methodological approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research framework of understanding single‐word reading, are warranted and encouraged.",

      "title": "Bipolar Disorders",
      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is a recurring complex psychopathological mood disorder causing significant impairment in children. PBD spectrum includes bipolar I (full manic episode), bipolar II (depression with hypomania) and bipolar not otherwise specified (NOS) (“others” in mid-spectrum who may be exhibiting prodromal PBD states but do not fit criteria clearly).The clinical presentation of PBD often does not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for bipolar disorder (BD), which was developed in adults and not adapted for children. The diagnosis becomes difficult because symptom presentation is variable and largely dependent on developmental age. Although discrete episodes of mania and depression that define BD in adults may match the presentation of some patients who have BD in adolescence, patients who have BD of childhood and prepubertal onset may or may not manifest these clear-cut episodes. The duration of episodes in children may be as short as 1 to 2 days. Mood symptoms can be chronic, can present as predominantly mixed episodes, or can continuously cycle rapidly, with severe irritability or aggression as the usual presenting symptoms. Disruptive behavior, hyperarousal, racing thoughts, elation, and grandiosity also may characterize the moods. A major depressive presentation is associated with a significant risk for developing subsequent BD. Poor psychosocial skills as well as cognitive and attention deficits may manifest along with mood and behavior changes. The chronic relapsing mode of PBD may extend into early adulthood. Longitudinal studies abound on PBD; yet, there is no firm agreement on exactly what constitutes the diagnosis of PBD.Complicating the diagnosis of PBD is the high rate of comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, conduct, substance abuse, and oppositional defiant disorders. Children who have both PBD and ADHD tend to manifest a more severe course of illness, presenting with psychosis and comorbid depression often requiring hospitalization. Although both PBD and ADHD include symptoms of distractibility and hyperactivity, the distinguishing symptoms of mania, flight of ideas, decreased need for sleep, and exhibition of sexual tendencies are present in PBD but usually not in ADHD.PBD is thought to result from an interaction among genetic and environmental risk factors in which family environment is important. The genetic endowment of parents might contribute to the family dysfunction, predisposing already genetically affected offspring to evolution of the disorder. PBD is a highly heritable disorder having a documented genetic determinant, although its basis is not yet fully elucidated. Family history is the most significant risk factor for developing the illness. Studies show an increased risk of psychopathology in the offspring of parents who have BD. Early depression, anxieties, and dysregulated behavior may be useful markers for later development of BD in high-risk children. Those symptoms may be episodic. Some researchers suggest that PBD markers may be detectable almost a decade before the onset of the clinical disorder.Ongoing research is searching to identify PBD prodromes and early risk markers for the later developments of PBD. Clinical staging is proposed in identifying the PBD evolution among at-risk children. Early symptoms in the evolution include abnormalities in temperament, anxiety, sleep disruption, minor mood disturbance, difficulties with emotion regulation, and adjustment problems, progressing into mixed mood episodes, followed by frank bipolarity later in adolescence and adulthood. Heritable biomarkers in the areas of attention, executive function, and affect processing are subjects of ongoing research. There may be structural, functional, and biochemical alterations in the brain predisposing the child to mood instability.Research has suggested that physical, sexual, and emotional childhood traumas that occur at a time of sensitivity of the maturing central nervous system may predispose to and modulate the clinical expression and course of the PBD. Traumas cause organic changes in the brain that lead to mood dysregulation. These changes may result in a rapid cycling course, psychotic features, suicidal behavior, and an earlier age of onset, all of which induce a more severe clinical PBD profile. Traumas can result from any stressful event. Examples include behavioral, educational, family related, or substance abuse induced episodes; negative life events, such as low socioeconomic status, ongoing family conflicts, or low quality of life; or any disappointing life events such as school failure or termination of relationships.As many as two thirds of adults given a diagnosis of BP had symptoms beginning in childhood. This finding underscores the importance of risk and prodrome recognition, along with early and accurate diagnosis that allows intervention before full development of the highly impairing disorder. Expert agreements on what constitute key features and valid biomarkers for PBD diagnosis are needed.Comments: When reviewing community-based studies, the diagnosis of PBD has increased dramatically over the past decade. In retrospective studies in adults, 10% to 20% revealed the onset of symptoms when they were younger than 10 years of age, and 60% when younger than 20 years, with most self-reporting a delay of 10 years in making the diagnosis. Although unfortunate, this finding may not be surprising, because there are less clear diagnostic criteria for children and because pediatricians have not been trained to consider this diagnosis. Early diagnosis is important in order to initiate appropriate treatment and minimize morbidity and mortality, such as through suicide. As pediatricians, we need to consider the diagnosis in children who exhibit irritability and aggression, and a family history of bipolar disease is important to determine. Future research is needed to better examine treatment options in children and whether earlier treatment will result in better outcomes. The challenge of managing PBD is yet another example of the importance of mental health training for pediatricians and for collaboration with mental health providers to provide the best possible care to our patients.Janet Serwint, MDConsulting Editor, In Brief",

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety frequently coexist in the same individual, either concurrently or at different times, and numerous studies show that the presence of an anxiety disorder is the single strongest risk factor for development of depression. When the two coexist simultaneously, either as diagnosed disorders or subsyndromal states, they may be viewed as mixed anxiety–depression or as comorbid syndromes, i.e. separate disorders occurring concurrently. Controversy continues over the nature of the relationship between depression and anxiety, some believing they are distinct, separate entities while others – now the majority – view them as overlapping syndromes that present at different points on a phenomenological and/or chronological continuum, and share a common neurobiology, the degree of overlap depending on whether each is described at the level of symptoms, syndrome or diagnosis. Community data likely underestimate true prevalence, since affected individuals frequently present in primary care with somatic, rather than psychological, complaints. Irrespective of the nature of the relationship, patients with both disorders experience significant vocational and interpersonal impairment, and more frequent recurrence, with greater likelihood of suicide, than individuals with single disorders. Various classes of antidepressant drugs offer symptom relief for these patients, the most selective of th SSRIs holding the greatest promise for sustained clinical improvement. Yet, the crucial parameter of successful pharmacotherapy seems to be the length of treatment, ensuring enhancement of the compromised neuroprotective and neuroplastic mechanisms. Further clarification of the relationship is a prerequisite for offering effective treatment to the many patients who experience lifetime depression and anxiety.",

A higher degree of specificity might have: chiefly fear of failure, susceptibility, and tension, secondarily emotivity, fear of unpredictable events, sense of insufficient time, preoccupation with authority factors, and tendency to endure unacceptable situations, and also faulty patience and lack of punctuality. Rumination appears to be the psychological tendency most strongly associated with FD.

The support may come from organized therapy and self-help groups or from interpersonal relationships outside a group. However, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic illness with characteristics that seriously interfere with patients receiving social support of any kind. Three factors: the threat of a drastically shortened life, an unpredictable illness course, and stigma, not only interfere with AIDS patients receiving sustained social support from the outside world but can dramatically influence the Process of a psychotherapy group. The factor of early death, which can impact group cohesion, can be dealt with by encouraging nourning and facilitating accurate interpretation of group process. The factors of an unpredictable illness course can impact group cohesion by helplessness, making continuity across sessions difficult, and by excessive focus on individuals. These factors can be dealt with by encouraging expression of feelings, and focusing on the present and on group process. The factor of deviancy/stigma can impact group cohesion by rejection/hatred of self and others, but can be dealt with by providing unconditional acceptance. Therapy is often a matter of helping the patient appreciate life's complexities to enlarge his/her cognitive worldview and spectrum of emotional functioning.",

The greatest interest, however, has been generated by the association between TBI and schizophrenia-like psychosis (Krafft-Ebing 1868), and this is the focus of this chapter. The most important question is whether TBI predisposes an individual to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. If this association can be unequivocally established, a number of other issues become relevant, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI, its clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis. An important corollary is whether the study of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI can advance the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "There are large-scale preventive programmes to reduce the risk of death and disability caused by several frequent physical diseases. The primary and secondary prevention of schizophrenia, a disorder entailing many years of life in disability, is still being neglected. Prevention is aimed at reducing the incidence, severity or consequences of the disorder. To find ways of preventive intervention in schizophrenia, the aetiological risk factors must be identified, then eliminated or modified. As possible targets pre-, peri- and postnatal complications, urbanicity and early behavioural risk indicators are discussed. As examples of successful early prevention targeted at risk indicators attempts to prevent depression and violence are considered. The most promising approach at present is secondary prevention focused on early illness course. Based on a controlled retrospective assessment of 232 first illness episodes the course of prodromi, impairments and psychotic symptoms prior to the climax of the first episode is shown. Most of the social consequences occur before the first treatment contact, thus making plain the urgent need for preventive action. Tools sufficiently validated are not yet available for early diagnosis and prediction of psychosis onset at the prepsychotic stage. So intervention has to be based on high-risk inclusion criteria, which exclude large proportions of at-risk persons. Appropriate early intervention at the prepsychotic, prodromal and the early psychotic stage as well as relevant ethical considerations are discussed. The frequency of and distress associated with single psychotic symptoms in the general population are potent predictors of a psychosis. The vision of treating this early illness dimension with third-generation, side-effect-free antipsychotics or of preventing its onset by oestrogen-like substances is discussed.",

Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

      "title": "Innovative methods for improving cognition, motivation and wellbeing in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders involve impairment of cognition, motivation and their interaction1. Cognitive manifestations include attentional biases, aberrant learning, dysfunctional reward processing, and lack of top-down cognitive control by the prefrontal cortex. These cognitive manifestations are both \"cold\" or non-emotional and \"hot\" or social and emotional2. From a neurobiological perspective, these relate to two partially segregated loops: the \"cold\" loop including the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the \"hot\" affective loop including the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum, with strong connections to the \"emotional brain\" including the amygdala2. There are three major problems in schizophrenia: positive symptoms, cognitive symptoms and motivational deficits, which include negative symptoms. Green et al3 make a compelling argument that cognitive impairments in both social and nonsocial domains are core features of the illness. Although antipsychotic medications treat hallucinations and delusions reasonably well, they have little impact on functional outcomes. One of the biggest challenges of this century is how to treat early and effectively the cognitive and motivational deficits in patients with schizophrenia in order to prevent their persistence and ensure the best possible outcome. Our group has focused on episodic memory impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders. Impaired episodic memory occurs early and strongly relates to functionality in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Episodic memory is also a functional correlate that is impaired in patients with a first episode of psychosis and further declines as the illness becomes more chronic. This form of new learning and memory has been shown to utilize a neural circuitry including the hippocampus. Changes in hippocampal subfields, including volume loss in the hippocampal stratum layers and the dentate gyrus, have been implicated in memory dysfunction in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia4. Although cognitive dysfunction is acknowledged as a target for treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there are no licensed medications currently available. We thus propose that innovative pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods should be developed and implemented further to target both cognitive and motivational dysfunction in the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, rather than focussing on diagnostic status. Interest in the cognitive-enhancing properties of modafinil has been the focus of considerable experimental medicine research over the last two decades. Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent that has been shown to enhance cognitive performance and task-related motivation in healthy volunteers. Modafinil has also been found to have positive effects in clinical populations such as adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The precise mechanism for the cognitive-enhancing effects is not clear, but this agent is thought to activate the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems in several brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. It has been shown that modafinil improves episodic memory in patients with schizophrenia5. This agent has also been reported to selectively improve spatial working memory and emotional processing (e.g. affect recognition, which might help social and occupational functioning) in first-episode schizophrenia, as well as a range of cognitive domains – including attentional set shifting, visual memory and spatial planning – in chronic schizophrenia6. Importantly, there have been no safety concerns about exacerbating psychotic symptoms, and there is no evidence of abuse potential when administering modafinil at 200 mg/day. Simultaneously enhancing cognition and motivation may have broad down-stream effects on patients' functioning, quality of life and wellbeing6. It is also possible that improving memory or functioning more generally through cognitive enhancement could help protect against psychotic relapse. In addition to novel cognitive-enhancing drugs, non-pharmacological interventions also have the potential to target symptoms as low-risk non-invasive options for patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation strategies generate moderate effect sizes on cognition and psychosocial functioning and a smaller effect size on psychiatric symptom severity in schizophrenia7. Cognitive training, in particular, has been shown to increase dopamine D1 receptor density in the brain and produce functional changes in the fronto-parietal network8. However, compliance with cognitive training may be problematic, leading to high drop out rates, thus requiring a more motivational approach. To overcome this challenge, a study from our laboratory recently combined cognitive training with gaming technology, showing that playing eight hours of the novel Wizard memory game (www.peak.net) on an iPad improved episodic memory and global functioning in patients with schizophrenia1. Importantly, high levels of enjoyment and task-related motivation were maintained throughout all hours of gameplay. Our game was also titrated in difficulty in real-time, akin to personalized medicine, to promote a sense of achievement whilst maintaining high levels of motivation and improving performance over time. We therefore maximized the effects of cognitive training by directly increasing active engagement with the intervention. Advantages of incorporating a cognitive training programme into a game are that it helps de-stigmatize treatment, since everyone plays games; it is convenient, as travel to a hospital or clinic is not necessary and specialist equipment is not required; it is not associated with side effects; and it is highly rewarding. Use of exciting new technology in mental health, in particular gaming platforms, could reach more patients inexpensively, including adolescents at ultra-high risk of schizophrenia. Gamified cognitive training could also yield benefits for mood and self-esteem, as improvements in memory function following gameplay could be attributed to the self rather than a drug. In order to identify changes in cognition, emotion and motivation, there is a need for objective and reliable measures for evaluating affective domains. EMOTICOM (www.cambridgecognition.com) is a novel neuropsychological test battery of emotion processing, motivation, impulsivity and social cognition. Recent evidence has shown that this battery is likely to be highly relevant to \"hot\" cognitive processes in paranoid schizophrenia, as one key aspect implicated in the formation and maintenance of a persecutory delusion is the hostile perception of others, including their beliefs and intentions9. EMOTICOM could also be used in treatment development and efficacy research, such as the evaluation of the neuropeptide oxytocin, which has shown some effects on social cognition in schizophrenia. Interventions such as oxytocin or modafinil, used in combination with gamified cognitive training, may synergize to increase plasticity and learning, promoting improvement in both \"hot\" and \"cold\" cognition as well as in social functioning. Augmentation therapies would be particularly useful for rehabilitating patients who have cognitive impairments that persist even after remission of the more acute symptoms. If young people with schizophrenia are to have the best chance of realizing their potential and of having good functionality and wellbeing, we will have to move to game-changing initiatives that prioritize early detection and early effective intervention. With a move to first-episode psychosis clinics and research studies focusing on children and adolescents with an ultra-high risk of schizophrenia, interventions that target cognition and motivation can be implemented much earlier in the course of the illness, before \"rescuing\" cognition is the only option. Good cognition and positive wellbeing are closely linked and both are required for a flourishing society.",

      "title": "Treatment-Resistant Psychosis and Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Treatment options for schizophrenia have included many new antipsychotic agents in recent years. Managing this condition can be especially complicated when the patient responds poorly to treatment and has ongoing problems with adherence. Identifying information: Mr M, a 54-year-old divorced white male with a history of chronic schizophrenia, presents to the emergency department unkempt, agitated, paranoid, and combative. Chief complaint: The patient claims his mother is planning to kill him and that she seduced him when he was a child. History of present illness: Mr M developed symptoms of schizophrenia at age 17. His symptoms were milder early in the disease course. He attended college and earned a degree in comparative literature. Afterward, he was never able to hold gainful employment and eventually went on Social Security disability. He has had numerous previous hospitalizations (50 or more), with increasing frequency in the past 2 years. He has become increasingly combative. During a previous hospitalization Mr M assaulted a nurse. His medical management is currently handled in an assertive community treatment (ACT) program. In the past, he participated in a local mental health drop-in clinic where he could socialize and meet people, but he is now too paranoid to participate. Medications and allergies: Because of ongoing adherence problems, Mr. M is required by the ACT program to receive depot antipsychotic medications by injection. His current antipsychotic regimen consists of haloperidol decanoate 100 mg per month, divalproex 1200 mg/d, and risperidone intramuscular injection 25 mg every other week. Ten days prior to this admission, he refused these injections. Side effects of his medication include pseudoparkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, and erectile dysfunction. To control the pseudoparkinsonism symptoms, the patient takes trihexyphenidyl orally 5 mg bid. He previously received some benefit from clozapine but this was discontinued because the patient refused weekly blood draws due to their inconvenience and discomfort. Previous medication history includes carbamazepine, lithium, and probably many other agents during the 37-year course of his disease. Although he occasionally develops symptoms of depression and has threatened to kill himself, antidepressants have not led to consistent improvement and he is not currently taking any. He is a heavy smoker but has no other substance abuse history. Family history: There is no family history of mental illness. The patient's immediate family members are high functioning and psychiatrically well. Mr M lives alone and his parents support him financially, help him with household tasks, and monitor his behavior. He maintains contact with his ex-wife, whom he met as an inpatient and who also has schizophrenia. She divorced him after he became abusive toward her. Review of systems: Other than a cough related to his heavy smoking, he has no complaints. Mental status: The patient is seen in the emergency department lying on a gurney, unshaven, smelly, with long greasy hair and multiple layers of clothing despite summer weather, He displays an angry and hostile affect and directs anger toward his mother, whom he accused of sexually molesting him in childhood. Although his vocabulary is advanced, his speech is filled with profanity. He is sexually preoccupied and complains loudly and bitterly about his erectile dysfunction. His target symptoms include disorganized thinking, tangential speech, paranoid and sexual delusions, auditory hallucinations, and hostility. The patient has prominent oral-buccal movements, of which he appears to be unaware, and has mild hand tremors and cogwheel rigidity. He has no insight, but understands that doctors believe he has schizophrenia. Assessment: Chronic psychosis Provisional diagnosis: Axis 1: Chronic schizophrenia, undifferentiated type Axis 11: None Axis III: Erectile dysfunction, pseudoparkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia Axis IV: Moderate stressors Axis V: 25 Treatment plan: Mr M was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit under a court order obtained due to his medication noncompliance. …",

BPD affects 1.6% of individuals annually, with some estimates going as high as 6%. About three times as many women than men are diagnosed. With age, the illness seems to become less prevalent.

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia has a long history of misunderstanding that continues to challenge clinicians and researchers today. This devastating disease is surprisingly common, affecting approximately half to 1% of the world's population. Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric syndrome characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations), emotional dysregulation, and deficits in attention and short‐term memory. This syndrome results from a complex interplay between environmental factors and genetic susceptibility, and is typically treated with antipsychotic medications and psychosocial therapies. Substantial evidence suggests that schizophrenia is a disorder of neurodevelopment and that psychotic symptoms may actually represent a late stage of the illness process, not the onset. Key Concepts: Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric syndrome characterised by delusions and hallucinations, emotional dysregulation and cognitive dysfunction. Schizophrenia is caused by a complex interplay of environmental factors and inherited genetic susceptibility. Schizophrenia is now considered to be a neurodevelopmental disorder in which psychosis represents a late, and potentially preventable, outcome of the illness. The neurobiological basis of schizophrenia includes widespread impairments in cortical and subcortical neural circuits including the prefrontal cortex and alterations in a variety of neurotransmitter systems. Schizophrenia is mainly treated with antipsychotic medications and psychosocial therapies.",

Compulsive behaviours resemble stereotypic movements seen in animals or cultural rituals. Cognitively, anticipating potential future risk scenarios may help in minimising threat, suggesting that obsessivecompulsive disorder may be a by-product of foresight. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is often linked to life events that require heightened vigilance for threat, including sexual maturation (puberty), pregnancy, and childbirth. While most individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder follow a ‘slow’ life-history strategy, cases with increased impulsivity and reduced inhibitory control seem to pursue a ‘fast’ life-history strategy.",

      "title": "Pruritus Ani",
      "abstract": "Summary Pruritus ani, although it presents as the only symptom, never occurs alone, but is associated with bizarre gastrointestinal symptoms and sexual disorders. Depressive and paranoid trends are common. It is the leading symptom in a syndrome. This syndrome exists in its own right. No distinct personality type could be established; it was found to occur without personality disorder, in psychoneurotic and prepsychotic personalities, and in frank psychoses. Its origin can be traced to a reactivation in adult life of infantile (unconscious) fantasies about procreation centering round the anal function, which precede genital interest and knowledge of sex. These \"cloacal\" fantasies are revived in their original primitive mode, as bodily sensations rather than ideas; the symptoms thus represent the fantasy. They appear as distressing somatic symptoms because such archaic fantasies are incompatible with reality. A breakthrough into consciousness is thus prevented and psychotic delusions avoided. Revival of procreation fantasies must be more deeply disturbing in the man than in the woman; this is borne-out by the greater severity, longer duration, and preponderance of male cases. The syndrome is capable of reduction by psychotherapy. The structure of this syndrome is simpler than that of the psychoneuroses. By the absence of overt anxiety it can be separated from anxiety hysteria, and by the absence of true obsessions, with their tendency to displacement and spread, from obsessive-compulsive neurosis. Secondary gain is absent. Its psychopathology suggests a hypochondriacal syndrome with specific content. Freud classed hypochondria among the \"actualneuroses\" to which psychoanalysis had little to contribute. In psychiatry proper hypochondria is also a stepchild. Brachet speaks of it as a \"disorder of the imagination.\" Gillespie8 defines \"the syndrome of hypochondria\" as, \"A mental preoccupation with a real or supposititious physical or mental disorder, a discrepancy between the degree of preoccupation and the grounds for it, so that the former is far in excess of what is justified, and an affective condition best described as interest with conviction and consequent concern, and with an indifference to the opinion of the environment, including irresponsiveness to persuasion… usually inaccessible to psychotherapy… it affects men predominantly… it can shade into schizophrenia… in its mild form it is often erroneously diagnosed as anxiety neurosis or hysteria.\" This description neatly condenses our findings on patients with pruritus ani. It should perhaps be added that in the clinical example given by Gillespie of hypochondria there was, besides intestinal symptoms of \"a bizarre nature\" and \"persecutory ideas of a peculiar kind referring to his gullet and genital organs, \" also \"a tearing away at the anus.\"",

      "title": "Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy: Pathogenetic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications",
      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

Early signs precede in more 50% of cases the delirious exacerbation of 6 months. These non-specific signs are a change in the mood, an increase of anxiety, sleep and food disorders and suicidal ideation. After this prodromal phase, a persecutory delusion and hallucinations are often present in decompensated schizophrenia. In decompensated bipolar disorder, the delusional syndrome is congruent with the mood. The care should be the earliest possible. The treatment by antipsychotic or mood stabilizer must be increased or re-introduced and maintained during a long time in order to prevent a relapse.

Laporan kasus: Perempuan 45 tahun merupakan pasien skizofrenia paranoid (F20.02). Selama sebulan terakhir, pasien juga sering merasa lelah dan tidak bersemangat. Ia berpikir tinggal menunggu waktu saja untuk bisa menyusul kedua orang tuanya yang sudah meninggal dunia. Pasien tidak memiliki niatan bunuh diri dan tidak pernah melakukan percobaan bunuh diri. Terdapat dua diagnosis banding pada pasien ini, yaitu skizoafektif tipe depresif (F25.1) dan episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik (F32.3).Diskusi: Topik pembicaraan pada gangguan afek pasien ini selalu berkaitan dengan suasana berkabung, yaitu kematian kedua orang tuanya. Respon terhadap kehilangan yang bermakna, misalnya berkabung, sangat mungkin menyerupai episode depresif.Kesimpulan: Suasana berkabung dapat dibedakan dengan episode depresi dengan melihat beberapa karakteristik gejalanya.

The most enduring of several early theories has suggested a causal link with formal thought disorder, whereas recent approaches have proposed relationships with a variety of cognitive abnormalities. The correlations of delusions with other schizophrenic symptoms and with cognitive functions including semantic memory, executive function, and also probabilistic reasoning bias, were examined in a series of (overlapping) groups of 43-79 schizophrenic patients. Delusions were found to be significantly correlated with formal thought disorder, with evidence for a particular link between bizarreness and fragmentariness of delusions and \"loosening of association\". Delusions were not significantly correlated with overall intellectual function or memory, although there was some suggestion of a complex interaction between delusions, formal thought disorder, and semantic memory impairment. No association between delusions, formal thought disorder, and any measure of executive function was found. Although, as a group, schizophrenic patients showed evidence of probabilistic reasoning bias, this was unrelated to presence and severity of delusions.",

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

The results of this study show that global competence of schizophrenics can be differentiated from specific competence. Global competence was found to be related to symptoms, whereas specific competence was not. No support was found for the assumption that social dysfunctions are caused by negative symptoms. Social perception and positive symptoms did explain a substantial part of the variance of global competence. It is therefore concluded that neither global incompetence nor negative symptoms should be used as an indication for social skills training.",

      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can take many different forms of presentations. The term ‘complex’ is common and inconsistently used in both OCD and BDD. Practitioners often refer to complex OCD or BDD when patients present with severe co-morbid problems, often in the context of personality difficulties, dissociation, difficult early relationships and trauma; or when the illness is chronic and debilitating with previous multiple treatment failures. Current best-evidence treatment protocols for both disorders focus heavily on exposure and response prevention (E/RP) but with moderate success, particularly in patients who are deemed ‘complex’, and often those with relevant shame and/or disgust-based past experiences. The aim of the present paper is to (a) describe factors that contribute to complexity in OCD and BDD, and (b) link these with theory and practice. We emphasize the importance of understanding both the function of OCD and BDD-related behaviours (rather than the content of obsessions or compulsion), and the context in which they occur such as the family. We illustrate complexity in OCD and BDD using real case material, using a functional and contextual approach to formulate the client's difficulties, and demonstrate how E/RP can be enhanced successfully with imagery rescripting, family work, and compassion-focused therapy.",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders. Up to 20% of adults are affected by anxiety disorders each year. Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

      "title": "Interventions for the Prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Sudden Unexplained Death in Infancy: A Review of Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under the age of one (i.e., death for which a cause is not found even after a thorough investigation including review of clinical history, examination of death scene and a complete autopsy). Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) also known as Sudden unexplained infant death is a term used to describe sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant for which external risk factors may be present. SUDI is a blanket term that encompasses SIDS, other unexplained infant deaths, and explained infant suffocations. SIDS and SUDI are not diagnoses. Risk factors for SIDS fall under three groups: intrinsic risk factors (e.g., male sex, prematurity, exposure to cigarette smoke), extrinsic risk factors (e.g., prone or side sleep position, bed sharing, overheating) and exogenous factors (e.g., ethnicity, climate, geographical location). It has been shown that racial and ethnic disparities (such as Indigenous peoples and other racial minorities) and vulnerabilities (such as low socioeconomic status, fewer social supports, those experiencing problems with housing, violence or mental illness) may contribute to increased risk of SIDS.,In Canada, the incidence of SUDI was the highest in 1980 with a rate of 2.07 SUDI per 1,000 live births. The rates of SUDI and SIDS have since decreased, especially since the 1990s. In 2018, there were ten deaths classified as SIDS in Canada. A global decrease in the incidence of SIDS can be attributed to widespread “Back-to-Sleep” campaigns, which were aimed to promote placing babies in a supine position for sleeping., Several similar risk reduction strategies, primarily focused on sleep position, have been implemented globally with the aim of reducing the incidence of SIDS and SUDI., The “Back-to-sleep” campaign was later expanded to the “Safe-to-sleep” campaign in 2012 to involve new and evolved evidence for preventing SIDS. As a result of continued research, guidelines regarding the prevention of SIDS and SUDI have been developed and updated throughout the last three decades.A previous CADTH Summary of Abstracts report, published in 2016, briefly summarized evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of SIDS. The purpose of this report is to summarize and critically appraise evidence-based guidelines that were published within the last five years regarding interventions for the prevention of SIDS or SUDI.",

      "title": "Review of Delusional Jealousy and Its Association with Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Introduction Mental state changes can affect one’s sexual life, while sexual dysfunction can lead to relationship challenges. Delusional jealousy, also called Othello syndrome, involves a paranoid belief in a partner’s infidelity, leading to controlling and violent behaviors. It can manifest as a paranoid disorder, as a delusional symptom of psychiatric, neurological or other medical conditions, or as side effect of dopaminergic medication. Although its exact prevalence remains uncertain, it has been identified in 0.5-1.4% of psychiatry inpatients. Objectives To describe sexual dysfunctions associated with delusional jealousy and to explore strategies for addressing these dysfunction. Methods A non-systematic review of the literature available at PubMed was conducted using the keywords “Sexual Dysfunction” AND “Delusional Jealousy OR Othello Syndrome”. Results A number of factors, including sexual dysfunction, can trigger or exacerbate delusional jealousy. This is especially true for middle-aged men who have a history of alcohol consumption, neurological or personality disorders. Individuals with sexual dysfunction experience feelings of insecurity, projecting these concerns onto their partners and suspecting extramarital relationships. On the other hand, sexual dysfunctions such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Female Sexual Arousal and Orgasmic Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction and Ejaculation Disturbance may occur as consequence of Othello Syndrome. Multiple factors contribute to these dysfunctions, including increased testosterone and cortisol levels, chronic alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric conditions and antipsychotics. There are reports of increased sexual desire, especially in cases of dementia. Conclusions Although the evidence is limited and dated, it points to a bidirectional association between delusional jealousy and sexual dysfunction. Further studies are essential to determine the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunctions in Othello syndrome, and the causal relationship between them. Additionally, investigating gender differences is crucial, given the male-centric focus of existing studies. This research can contribute to clinical care by promoting the screening for sexual issues and their integration into delusional jealousy management. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a global prevalence of approximately 2% and significant psychiatric comorbidity. There is a great deal of existing literature assessing different aspects of psychology in psoriasis. We aimed to conduct an in-depth review of current evidence linking psoriasis to personality traits and psychiatric comorbidities, as well as factors that put these patients at risk of psychopathology. Materials and Methods: A search of the PubMed database identified 1632 articles. We included articles studying psychological comorbidity in patients with psoriasis, looking especially at personality characteristics, and data linking psoriasis with increased risks of psychological distress, depression, anxiety and suicidality. In particular, we also evaluated subgroups in psoriasis found to be at risk. Results: Patients with psoriasis are more likely to be alexithymic, lack body awareness and possess a Type D personality. Alcohol, but not illicit drug use, disorders are also more common in patients with psoriasis. Patient groups who are especially at risk of psychological distress include women, younger patients, patients with a younger age of disease onset, those who self-assess their psoriasis to be severe, and those with lesions on visible or sensitive areas. Adopting motivational interviewing skills and incorporating the use of learning materials during consultations have been found to be useful. Conclusion: The knowledge of personality characteristics, “at-risk” groups, and early recognition of psychological distress among patients with psoriasis can help clinicians provide better holistic care and encourage a change in patients’ behaviour. Key words: Alexithymia, Personality, Psychopathology, Suicidality",

      "title": "Challenges in reducing depression-related mortality in cardiac populations: cognition, emotion, fatigue or personality?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cardiac patients post-event; however treatment of psychological symptoms has failed to reduce cardiovascular risk. We explore depression and related constructs in terms of construct overlap and intervention potential. Certain depressive symptoms may be more important than others for increasing risk. Depressive cognitions may have lesser importance than somatic symptoms, but there is potential for designing interventions based on distorted illness perceptions. Somatic depressive symptoms and vital exhaustion are associated with increased risk. However, these symptoms may be more indicative of cardiovascular disease severity. A global tendency towards negative affectivity could account for the associations seen with negative affect states, with those of Type D personality demonstrating especially high levels of risk for morbidity/mortality. Positive emotion is associated with better outcomes, and could provide clues of how to intervene with negative emotion. Construct overlap and a dearth of theoretically based studies remain significant challenges. Future research needs to encompass all relevant variables to identify the key symptoms or symptom constellations that increase cardiovascular risk. A more sophisticated understanding of these issues can lead to more precise pinpointing of the ‘cardiotoxic’ aspects of psychological status, and ultimately to more refined interventions.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Many individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) die of disease-related complications, but predicting the end of life can be challenging. We identified a phenotype associated with approaching end of life. Methods: We present 4 exemplar cases where individuals with DLB experienced refractory psychosis before death. We reviewed codebooks and quotes from 3 studies regarding end-of-life experiences in DLB to identify experiences that aligned with this phenotype. Results: In addition to the 4 cases, family caregivers in prior studies described prominent worsening of psychosis before death in some individuals with DLB. The worsening often occurred several months before death and was sometimes associated with rapid deterioration. Worsening psychosis was the prominent symptom and was not initially accompanied by cognitive or physical decline. In many cases, the refractory psychosis resulted in inpatient psychiatric hospitalization or residential care, but these scenarios were challenging because of the individual’s behavior. Conclusion: Refractory psychosis in DLB, particularly out of proportion to other symptoms, may be a signal of approaching the end of life. More research is needed to understand this phenomenon and to develop effective and safe treatments for psychosis in DLB.",

Pseudoneurotic TypeVarious neurotic symptoms such as anxiety, phobia, obsession and neurasthenic symptom are flourish.Thought disorder or the superficial emotional contact are prominent in most cases, but autism, the primary schizophrenic disorder is not remarkable in some of these cases, although Hoch, P. insisted that pseudoneurotic schizophrenia is not the borderline case, but a sub-type of schizophrenia.2. Type of Character DeviationSymptoms are vague and transient, and the disorders of the social life due to the various abnormal behavior and the distortion of the inter-personal relationship are characteristic.Severe disorder of the personality which is difficult to differentiate from psychopath or simple schizophrenia is cardinal in this type.3. Mono-symptomatic TypeDelusional interpretation about his shape, expression or smell persists for a long period.The appearance of the symptom is closely related with the special situation, the presence of other peoples, and the disorder of the personality is minimum.In these cases, the neurotic picture is more evident than in the other types.",

      "title": "Subjective Well-being and Initial Dysphoric Reaction under Antipsychotic Drugs - Concepts, Measurement and Clinical Relevance",
      "abstract": "Since the introduction of neuroleptics in 1952, many studies have examined objective aspects of efficacy and tolerability. Despite the fact that neuroleptic treatment should also improve the patient's subjective experiences, this outcome criterion has been neglected in the past. This is unfortunate, as subjective well-being with treatment appears to be strongly related to patients' readiness to take their medication. The few existing studies differ in methodology and are difficult to compare due to a number of weaknesses, including varying underlying concepts, used assessment scales, or small sample sizes. Negative subjective well-being may manifest itself throughout the entire neuroleptic treatment, even as early as in the first 48 hours after neuroleptic treatment starts (initial dysphoric reaction, IDR). The aetiology of reduced subjective well-being or IDR is not fully explained; neuroleptic side effects, especially affective, cognitive and motor adverse events, differential effects of varying psychopathology or biopsychosocial are factors in discussion. The clinical impression is characterised by symptoms as dysphoria/anhedonia, reduced vitality, and emotional indifference, which could have a negative impact on relevant clinical factors such as response or medication adherence, and therefore on outcome. With regard to pharmacological treatment, evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics induce less negative subjective effects than conventional neuroleptics, and that various new-generation antipsychotics could be evaluated differently by patients. This article reviews existing literature in order to approach relevant questions for pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in society. Depression is influenced by several factors, including the personality of the sufferer and the existence of a comorbid disease that aggravates the symptoms. Several previous studies have not clearly reported on the psychodynamic picture of depressed patients with dependent personality disorder accompanied by hypokalemia. The study aims to provide a psychodynamic picture of depressed patients with dependent personality disorder accompanied by hypokalemia. A man, 26 years old, an Indonesian citizen, came with the main complaint of feeling helpless to do anything that has been burdensome for the last 2 months. The complaint was felt to be aggravating after he started working as a private employee. The patient feels insecure in his ability to complete the work assigned to him and feels that he is looked down upon by his peers and superiors. Patients often miss the figure of their deceased father. In addition, the patient has suffered from hypokalemia since he was in high school and has taken potassium supplements until now. The symptoms of depression experienced by patients are aggravated by the presence of dependent personality disorders and hypokalemia suffered by patients. Dependent personality disorder lowers the patient's confidence, and hypokalemia aggravates the vegetative symptoms he experiences, such as body weakness, decreased appetite, and palpitations. Dependent personality disorder and hypokalemia are very influential in aggravating the clinical symptoms experienced by depressed patients",

      "abstract": "Social phobia is a common and often disabling condition, with an etiology that is not established. There is evidence at several levels for an interplay of biological and psychological processes in social phobia. Genetic studies show that both genetic and environmental factors are important, with evidence pointing to associations with 2 genetic conditions, autism and fragile X syndrome. Behavioral inhibition has emerged as an important precursor to social phobia and possibly to other anxiety disorders. Epidemiologic and clinical studies have suggested that factors within the family environment, such as overprotection, overcontrol, modeling of anxiety, criticism, and in some cases abuse, can play a role in the development of social phobia. During childhood, complex interactions between brain system disturbances that mediate responses to negative social cues and factors in the social setting may lead to the development of a distorted set of internal blueprints for social behavior. The impact of severe social anxiety on brain systems that mediate behavioral change may prevent patients from learning better blueprints. These can be taught through cognitive-behavioral therapies. The effective control of social anxiety with medications enables patients to recover; whether recovery can last after discontinuation of medications may depend on whether a new blueprint has been developed and whether stable changes in affected brain systems have occurred. Neuroimaging techniques are at the early stage of identifying abnormalities at the neurotransmitter and systems levels.",
