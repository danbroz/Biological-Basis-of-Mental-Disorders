      "title": "Substance Abuse and Its Addiction Among Young Adults",
      "abstract": "Substance use refers to the intake of drugs, like alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, inhalants, tobacco, and other harmful substances that lead to the deterioration of oneself, society, or both. It comprises both physical dependence and psychological dependence. Physical dependence caused by excessive intake of a drug refers to a change in the physiological state in which withdrawal symptoms develop when drugs are discontinued whereas psychological dependence refers to the state of need to continue using the drug even without physical dependence. Substance use also known as drug abuse or drug addiction is usage of drugs up to a certain level that disrupts the individual return to its normal state or condition prior to the intake. It could range from mild, moderate or severe depending on the drug intake. Addiction can supposedly be a form of drug abuse in terms of severity. Addiction refers to the need to be associated with something (here a substance) ignoring the adverse effects it can cause. It can also refer to a strong inclination towards repeated use of a substance. The higher the addiction, the higher the risk of developing a substance use disorder (SUD).",

      "title": "Is the Outcome of Alcohol Dependence Treatment Related to Intelligence of Patients",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlcohol is considered to be the leading cause of addiction in the world and its use over time does not diminish. Alcohol not only causes problems to people who are de- pendent on alcohol but also for a society as a whole because of its impact on health, welfare and the economy.1In Slovenia, for a decade or more, the officially registered consumption of pure alcohol per capita is around 11 liters. However, it is more realistic to estimate the pure alcohol consumption at around 15 liters because of the unchecked consumption of uncontrolled domestic production.2Harmful alcohol use is a transitional stage between a prudent drinker and a man who is alcohol dependent. Confirmation of the diagnosis of harmful alcohol use needs to meet one of the following criteria:3- repeated drinking prevents successful performance of the tasks at home or in the workplace;- the person drinks in circumstances where this may endanger himself or others;- recurring legal consequences, such as hardening of peace, driving under the influence of alcohol etc.;- repeated drinking despite problems in relationships caused by drinking.Longer harmful alcohol use may develop in the syndrome of alcohol dependence. Dependence is a medical condition in which a person, due to frequent, prolonged and excessive drinking becomes mentally or physically dependent on alcohol. The result is the typical behavior and thinking which is guided by a craving for alcohol and stick to drinking despite physical illness and adverse consequences in interpersonal relationships.3Treatment of alcohol dependenceTreatment may be roughly divided into three stages:- the preparatory phase,- the level of intensive care,- rehabilitation.In the preparatory phase a patient is deployed in a psychiatric clinic where psychiatrist performs ambulatory inspection and, if necessary, refers the person to check in to the clinical psychologist. The intensive treatment takes place in a mental institution or psychiatric hospital. »Length of stay« in the hospital is about 3 months. The second phase is followed by a third phase, which means the inclusion of the patients in the club for recovering alcoholics (in which their family members are also included) or inclusion in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).The goal of therapy is the abstinence. Patients who complete the treatment mostly return to the same environment in which they came up with excessive alcohol consumption, so it is important that the person after treatment is able to solve everyday problems without alcohol. Usually the patients are forced to treatment under pressure from family or employer and threatened with dismissal. During the treatment, patents become familiar with the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption and negative effects on their social life, cognitive ability and health. Modern methods of treatment allow a shift from inpatient to outpatient care but hospital care is often necessary, especially for people who can't establish abstinence in their own environment, have severe abstinence symptoms or mental illness or other medical complications, are deeply depressed or prone to suicide, or live in difficult social circumstances with weak support in their environment.3Intelligence in alcoholicsIntelligence is one of the major areas of psychological research. Most of authors understand intelligence as a general mental ability or general ability of effective thinking and problem solving, i.e. general intelligence factor.4'5General factor (g-factor) of intelligence is defined as a common denominator of all the components of our mental abilities. Spearman has an opinion that the achievements on tests of general intelligence are dependent on g-factor as well as the specific additional factors which he described as s-factor.4 Cattell introduced a division between fluid and crystallized intelligence.5Fluid abilities develop earlier and faster and are dependent on cognitive flexibility, adaptability and speed of information processing (e. …",

      "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Millions of individuals use alcohol every day; however, not everyone experiences a problem due to such use. It is therefore helpful to conceptualize alcohol use as ranging on a continuum from nonproblematic social use (e.g., a glass of wine with dinner); to alcohol misuse (e.g., a one-time incident of binge drinking); to excessive use or abuse (e.g., frequent use of alcohol that results in a negative impact on the life of the individual and those around him or her, such as recurrent driving under the influence of alcohol); and finally, to physical dependence or addiction to alcohol (e.g., a chronic disorder that may require medical detoxification and/or formal treatment). While not used professionally, the commonly used term alcoholism has been used synonymously with alcohol addiction and refers to the compulsive use of alcoholic beverages. Both terms imply a progressive deterioration of the individual’s social, physical, and mental status combined with the inability to stop using alcohol even when wishing to do so. Although the professional literature on alcohol use problems is extensive and can be found in almost every country in the world, the inconsistent use of terminology is often confusing. There are tremendous overlaps among literature on topics such as alcohol-related problems, risky drinking, hazardous drinking, alcohol abuse and dependence, substance abuse, and alcohol addiction. The confusion has been compounded by the changes in the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2013), which eliminated the previous diagnostic classifications of “alcohol abuse” and “alcohol dependence” and replace them with the overall category of “Alcohol Use Disorders” (AUD), which itself is part of the broader new DSM-5 category of “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders.” A fuller discussion of the DSM changes can be seen in S. Lala A. Straussner’s 2013 article “The DSM–5 diagnostic criteria: What’s new?” Journal of Social Work Practice in the Addictions. Research studies in the United States indicate a general decrease in the proportions of individuals with “pure” alcohol use diagnosis and an increase among those using multiple substances. Consequently, the topic of alcohol-use disorders needs to be considered within the context of the literature on problematic use of a variety of other chemical substances as well as other addictions, such as gambling and smoking. It also needs to take into account co-occurring mental disorders; age, gender, and sexual identity of users; socioeconomic and psychological issues; family dynamics; and ethnocultural factors. Finally, research and treatment focusing on AUD must be viewed within the context of governmental policies, which vary over time and in different locations.",

      "title": "Aging With or Aging Out of Drug Use? Older Adults’ Experiences of Aging with Long-Term Drug Use",
      "abstract": "Older adults with long-term drug use have long been overlooked in both drug research and aging research. More knowledge is needed about their experiences and needs. Drug use is often seen as a youth phenomenon and as something that with time leads to destructiveness and compulsion. A more nuanced picture of who uses drugs and what the use may look like over time is necessary. There is limited insight into what it means to age with drug use, based on individuals’ own stories and experiences. We conducted 27 semistructured interviews in Sweden with individuals aged 55 or older who reported current and long-term drug use. In this article, we demonstrate how the relationship with drugs evolves over time and how the interviewees contemplate stopping or continuing their use. Three themes were identified: (1) Aging out of drug use: Thoughts on drug cessation. Some expressed a desire to end their drug use. The reasons behind this varied, but there was a clear pattern related to older age. (2) Aging with drug use: Thoughts on continued use. Some had a desire to continue using drugs and expressed concern about how everyday life would be without them. (3) Age adapted drug use: A change in drug use. Several participants stated that their drug consumption had changed over time and with age. Drugs no longer dominated their lives as before but still served essential functions. The themes should not be seen as rigid categories, but as fluid narratives. Understanding this variation provides a deeper insight into people's often complex relationship with drugs.",

      "abstract": "Drinking alcohol-containing beverages is a common habit in Western countries. In most Western societies, at least 90% of people consume alcohol at some time during their lives, and 30% or more of drinkers develop alcohol-related life problems.1 Severe alcohol-related life impairment, alcohol dependence, is observed at some time during their lives in ∼10% of men and 3–5% of women, with an additional 5–10% of each sex developing persistent but less intense problems that are diagnosed as abuse.1\n\nIndividuals with alcohol abuse are not dependent on alcohol, but have repeated legal, interpersonal, social, or occupational impairments related to alcohol consumption.1,,2 They frequently use alcohol in physically hazardous situations. If individuals with alcohol abuse continue to drink, they may go on to develop alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is characterized by tolerance (a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve desired effect and/or markedly diminished effect with the continued use of the same amount of alcohol), and a withdrawal syndrome when alcohol is discontinued or intake is decreased. Alcohol-dependent individuals often spend a great deal of time using alcohol, and return to use despite evidence of physical and psychological problems. Alcohol abuse and dependence are commonly called alcoholism.\n\nDepression and alcoholism are associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and mortality, and co-occur more commonly than expected by chance.3–,8 The extent of comorbidity between depression and alcoholism was demonstrated by the results of several large epidemiological studies.3–,7 The National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a nationally representative survey in the US, found that compared with non-depressed respondents in the NCS, the lifetime odds of alcohol dependence were significantly elevated for both men (2.95) and women (4.05) with major depression.7 Conversely, NCS data demonstrated a two-fold increase …",

Intake of calories: unclear results up to 6 months, reduced intake between 13 and 24 months; unclear results at longer follow up times. Intake of fruit and vegetables: increased up to 6 months; little or no difference at longer follow up times. Use of computers and electronic games: small reduction measured up 12 months; little or no difference at longer follow up times. Self efficacy of diet, and self efficacy of diet and of physical activity: small increase up to 6 months, little or no difference for self efficacy of physical activity alone; no difference at longer follow up times.

      "title": "Alcohol consumption in late adolescence and early adulthood - where is the problem?",
      "abstract": "Risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD) is more common in late adolescence and early adulthood (approximately between the ages of 16 and 30) than in any other period in life. This is also the age when young people in Switzerland and many other European countries are legally allowed to buy and drink alcohol, but they usually do not yet have adult responsibilities. This paper reviews evidence from the international literature and provides examples of studies conducted in Switzerland demonstrating that (a) RSOD is by far most prevalent on Saturday evenings followed by Friday evenings, usually because young people go out and do not have any work or study responsibilities the next day; (b) RSOD results from drinking in private before going out (\"predrinking\") and accelerating the pace of drinking (i.e. increasing the number of drinks consumed per hour); (c) RSOD is often not accidental but purposeful,. to seek excitement, to have fun and to feel the effects of alcohol; (d) RSOD occurs predominantly outside the home, mostly in bars, pubs, discos or at special events and festivals; (e) RSOD often results in intended and unintended injuries and other acute consequences, which are leading risk factors for mortality and morbidity in this age group. Effective prevention strategies should include attempts to reduce opportunities to engage in heavy drinking as well as strategies to reduce its harmful consequences.",

Factors affecting consumptionConsumption of alcohol depends on several variables.Sex-Although men are twice as likely to have alcohol related problems, the gap between the sexes is narrowing.Occupation-Alcohol misuse is more common in jobs related to catering, brewing, and distilling.In others, such as doctors, sailors, and demolition workers, high consumption is perceived as the social norm.Homelessness-About a third of homeless people have alcohol problems.Race-British Afro-Caribbeans and south Asians have lower average consumption and lower hospital admission rates for alcohol related problems than white people.However, pockets of high consumption exist, as has been reported among Sikh men (particularly of spirits).About a fifth of Chinese and Japanese people cannot drink alcohol because of an inherited lack of the liver enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.",

      "abstract": "Many pathological problems that are prevalent in modern society, such as undersaving, overborrowing, credit-card bankruptcy, and lifestyle-related diseases (obesity, smoking, drug abuse, and gambling addiction), are all closely related to the choices made by the people who constitute the society. People sometimes overborrow money in order to spend it on leisure and/or luxury items, overeat, spend indulgent times, smoke, and gamble to the point of destitution. In all of these situations, the results of the choice to engage in such behaviors have adverse effects on the individual’s future. Moreover, self-harmful behavior is not always limited to the extreme cases described above. For example, on occasion, we sometimes stay up drinking until late at night even though we have a meeting early the next morning. As another example, rather than completing an important task with an impending deadline, we often engage in trivial tasks such as cleaning our work desk, checking e-mails, and self-grooming.",

      "title": "Sickness absence as an alcohol‐related problem",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use is related to sickness absence in two somewhat different ways. First, chronic heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of a large number of somatic or psychiatric illnesses, and through these illnesses continued heavy drinking may lead to sickness absence. Secondly, episodic heavy drinking and intoxication may lead to accidents, or to plain hangover, or to continuing drinking bouts which may be the grounds for sickness absence [1]. Alcoholic beverages can be used in many different ways. They can, for instance, be used as intoxicants, as beverages with meals, as thirst quenchers, as a means to celebrate several kinds of festive occasions or as a social lubricant in different situations. Different alcoholic beverages suit these different uses. Depending on the most important functions accorded to alcohol, drinking habits will vary across cultures. All alcoholic drinks, and especially wine, are used in many countries as a beverage with meals. When wine is used commonly with meals, per capita alcohol consumption is quite high. However, drinking with meals means that alcohol use is spread over many or all days of the week and the amount of alcohol consumed at one sitting usually stays reasonably low. Therefore, in wine-preferring countries such as those in the Mediterranean region, alcohol-related sickness absence should reflect mainly chronic heavy drinking. All alcoholic beverages can also be used purposively as intoxicants. In this case alcohol consumption is usually taking place in leisure time, weekends and evenings. In countries where these beverages have been used mainly as intoxicants, as in the Nordic countries, per capita alcohol consumption has traditionally been quite low. In those countries alcohol-related sickness absences are based mainly on episodic heavy drinking. During recent decades total alcohol consumption has been on the increase in the Nordic countries. In Iceland, Norway and Sweden, alcohol consumption is still lower than in the Mediterranean countries, but in Denmark and Finland total alcohol consumption (unrecorded alcohol included) is, at the moment, on the same level as in France, and higher than in Italy. This convergent trend in consumption levels is also the result of the decrease in wine consumption in the Mediterranean countries. Around the Mediterranean wine is still today used mainly as a beverage with meals, but the decrease in wine consumption has meant that other uses of alcohol have gained in relative importance, and especially among young drinkers who have begun to use alcohol to become drunk. In the Mediterranean countries a decrease in wine consumption has usually meant that wine has been substituted with water as a beverage with meals. Many people living in the Mediterranean area feel that this kind of development is a substitution of one beverage (alcohol) by another drink with meals (not including alcohol). In statistics this shows as a decrease in per capita alcohol consumption. In the Nordic countries water is also increasing its share as a beverage with meals. This, however, is not reflected in alcohol consumption statistics, as the substitution in this instance is taking place mainly from milk to water. One way to describe major trends in alcohol consumption during the last decades in western Europe could be to say that water has taken over as the traditional drink with meals. Consequently, alcoholic beverages have, during the last decades, lost their role as beverages with meals and become increasingly the beverage consumed during leisure, in many cases leading to intoxication. Consequently, compared to earlier decades alcohol-related sickness absences should nowadays be related more to heavy episodic drinking than to heavy chronic drinking. When some physical or psychiatric illness related to heavy drinking is the cause for sickness absence, in many cases it is possible to link the rates of absenteeism to alcohol consumption. Many alcohol-related somatic or psychiatric illnesses such as alcoholism, alcohol-related intoxication or alcohol-related liver diseases are already, by definition, linked to drinking in the codes of the International Classification of Diseases. When episodic heavy drinking is the cause for sickness absence it is much more difficult to relate the problem to alcohol consumption. In most cases, intoxication or any other cause leading to accident is not mentioned in the medical certificate. Even in cases where it could be mentioned, it is in the interests of the client that the accident is not combined officially with alcohol use because this could lead, for instance, to loss of insurance benefits. Furthermore, hangover or a continuing drinking bout is not a legitimate cause for being absent from work. As Thor Norström [1] has shown in his analysis of the Swedish experience, total alcohol consumption level is associated with sickness absence among men. His conclusion is that sickness absence can be added to the list of harm indicators related to alcohol consumption. Alcohol-related sickness absences and wider aspects of alcohol-related productivity losses, tie alcohol consumption regularly to economic efficiency. It may, however, be somewhat difficult to measure and document the real extent of alcohol-related sickness absenteeism in anysociety, especially as alcohol-related sickness absences are nowadays related increasingly to episodic heavy drinking rather than to prolonged heavy drinking.",

He was admitted in ward for further evaluation and treatment.Conclusion-Alcohol dependence is a chronic disorder that has many consequences. Optimal treatment with pharmacologic agents may help achieve desired outcomes. The currently available treatments for alcohol dependence are all valid options, and their use should be individualized.",

Addiction is more often now defined by the continuing, compulsive nature of the drug use despite physical and/or psychological harm to the user and society and includes both licit and illicit drugs, and the term \"substance abuse\" is now frequently used because of the broad range of substances (including alcohol and inhalants) that can fit the addictive profile. Psychological dependence is the subjective feeling that the user needs the drug to maintain a feeling of well-being; physical dependence is characterized by tolerance (the need for increasingly larger doses in order to achieve the initial effect) and withdrawal symptoms when the user is abstinent. There are a lot of effects of drug addiction to the economy, society, and family. Drug addiction affects individual's physical and mental health. Drug addicts are burden for a family and society. It is a great challenge for all nations of the world to prevent drug addiction. This article reviews the effects of drug addiction in details.

      "title": "Reducing the costs of alcohol in the workplace: the case for employer policies",
      "abstract": "More than 90% of the UK workforce drink alcohol and as many as 30% of male employees and 23% of female employees could be consuming quantities above ‘safe limits’. Survey results also indicate that the vast majority of dependent drinkers are in employment, Current evidence suggests that alcohol consumption, in or out of work time, can result in lower productivity, increased absenteeism and sickness absence, and increased accident rates. The annual value of industrial days lost though alcohol consumption in the UK since 1987 is estimated to be over £1.7 billion, excluding the value of lost productivity, accidents and injury. Alcohol acts as a depressant, impairing reasoning, memory, perception, balance and coordination skills even at very moderate levels of consumption. Physical and intellectual ability decline as more alcohol is consumed either at work or at leisure. In the longer run, continued consumption can lead to disease, emotional and social problems, chronic illness and even premature death. Because the majority of drinkers are in employment, these effects will have an impact in the workplace. Some adverse consequences at work are related to excessive alcohol misuse by a minority of employees, but most are associated with the moderate but inappropriate drinking behaviour of the majority. Existing evidence implies that alcohol is involved in at least one fifth of all UK industrial accidents. The probability of an accident increases six fold for the average man who has consumed two pints of beer, and risk-taking behaviour increases and decision making skills decrease even with low levels of consumption. One in ten men and one in twenty women report feelings the effects of a hangover at work and in one UK study, a quarter of all of the men interviewed reported regular lunchtime drinking. Up to 60% of USA corporations have introduced formal workplace policies of different types in order to reduce employment costs associated with alcohol consumption. However, less than 20% of UK firms have taken similar action. Workplace policies are designed to identify problem drinkers at an early stage and to provide treatment, avoiding the need for disciplinary procedures. Although many USA studies have shown workplace policies to be cost-effective, some studies report conflicting results using different definitions of successful outcome and policy goals. Many studies suffer from statistical defects and the poor definition of appropriate policy goals. The economic case for increasing the number and type of workplace policies in the UK cannot be confirmed without a consistent framework for evaluating cost-efficiency. Evidence of employment costs associated with alcohol consumption are examined in this paper and the need for further information identified. A framework for evaluating costs and benefits is outlined as a basis for future policy discussion, and the economic evaluation of alcohol workplace policies in the UK.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a slippery, hard-to-define concept. The one element of addiction that is commonly agreed upon is that addiction involves “reinforcement”: consumption of the addictive good or activity today increases the desire to consume the good in the future. By this reckoning alone, caffeine, cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, opiates, gambling, sex, exercise, chess, listening to music, watching television, playing video games, eBay, eating Chinese food, reading, and religious observance are addictive for many people. Public policy responds mainly to those potentially addictive substances or behaviors that tend to bring on severe adverse effects: whereas some people read too much, the negative consequences of “readaholism” are insufficiently widespread or dangerous to make book addiction a pressing social concern. But the detrimental effects arising from excessive indulgence in alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and gambling, among other vices, foster efforts at social (and sometimes governmental) influence or control.",

      "title": "Alcohol, still the forgotten drug",
      "abstract": "I was interested to read the paper by Staiger and colleagues 1. Although we persist in referring to drug and alcohol problems by reference to single substances, this can be misleading. It is now more than 10 years since I wrote an editorial in this journal about something that has long been known by all who work with people with substance use disorders: ‘Few drug takers confine themselves to using a single substance. Cigarettes and alcohol often go together. Heroin users may also take drugs such as cocaine and benzodiazepines, and heavy drinkers often also use illicit drugs. Virtually all heroin addicts are also cigarette smokers’ 2. The point of my editorial was that although the reality of multiple substance use is well known, it is seldom given the attention that it deserves. The reasons for this are many. Not the least of these is that matters become complicated when multiple substances are considered. For instance, if someone regularly uses two (or more) drugs, do they have one or two (or more) drug problems? If they are dependent upon two (or more drugs), do they have a more severe dependence problem than if they took only one drug? Is severity of dependence upon each drug additive? Or interactive? Or synergistic? ‘Our favourite drug’, alcohol, is widely used and widely misused. Within the extended menu of substances used by drug takers, alcohol has a special place and deserves greater attention than it generally receives. Staiger et al. draw our attention back to the misuse of alcohol by drug addicts and to the dearth of studies about how alcohol misuse may interact with other drug problems. Heavy drinking among patients in methadone programmes has been recognized as a problem since such programmes were established 3. Heavy drinking among drug misusers is also associated with serious health risks. Hepatitis C infection is common among injection drug users (IDUs), and infected people who drink heavily are at greatly increased risk of serious liver disease. Drug overdose is one of the most frequent causes of death among drug misusers, and heavy drinking among opiate misusers greatly increases the risk of overdose: many so-called heroin overdoses should be attributed more accurately to the combined use of alcohol with opiates 4. Heavy drinking was relatively common among dependent heroin users in the National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS): approximately a quarter were drinking heavily at treatment intake, and the same proportion continued to drink heavily throughout the 5-year follow-up 5. Although some problematic drinkers reduced their frequency and quantity of drinking, many made little change in their drinking behaviour; even with the reductions in quantity of alcohol among the problematic drinkers, typical daily amounts of alcohol at follow-up were between 10 and 19 units (approximately half a bottle of spirits) 6. The interrelationship between drinking and drug use remains poorly understood. Staiger et al. report several studies showing that alcohol use increases relapse to drug use. Our own research suggested that changes in heroin use and drinking outcomes may be largely independent, although heroin misusers who had poor drinking outcomes were more likely to also be using cocaine, amphetamines and benzodiazepines 6. One interesting but little-discussed aspect of the substance use behaviours of drug addicts is that although many are heavy drinkers, a relatively high proportion are abstinent from alcohol. More than a third of the NTORS sample had not used alcohol at all during the 3 months before treatment, and the proportion who were alcohol-abstainers remained constant throughout the 5-year study 5. This abstinence rate is much higher than for the general population. It is not only the drinking behaviour of heroin addicts that is neglected. There is surprisingly little interest in the broader issue of multiple substance misuse. Although there are problems with a substance-specific approach to drug use disorders, it is important to remember that different drugs have different attractions for different users. For example, the relatively high rates of alcohol abstinence among heroin addicts may not be found among other groups of drug misusers. A common pattern of multiple substance misuse involves the concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol. The combined use of alcohol and cocaine produces increased and prolonged euphoria compared to either substance on its own 7, and for some cocaine users the concurrent use of alcohol is an integral part of their pattern of drug-taking. This effect may also be influenced by the type of cocaine being used. Cocaine powder users report more frequent heavy drinking than crack users, and whereas cocaine powder users tended to use cocaine and alcohol concurrently, crack users tended to use alcohol at the end of crack-using sessions 8, 9. Drug users with concurrent polydrug use problems may require special consideration and treatment planning. Alcohol use and, in particular, excessive drinking, is often neglected in the treatment of drug users. Drug users and clinical staff may focus either deliberately or unintentionally upon what is perceived to be the main illicit problem drug and under-rate the use of other substances. The extent and severity of heavy drinking among drug misusers points to the need to develop programmes and interventions that are designed specifically to tackle alcohol-related problems in this client group.

      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, may be a disease that affects an individual's brain and behaviour and results in an inability to regulate the utilization of a legal or illegal drug or medication. Substances like alcohol, marijuana and nicotine are also considered drugs. When you're addicted, you'll continue using the drug despite the harm it causes . Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a narcotic in social situations, and, for a few people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, white plague begins with exposure to prescribed medications, or receiving medications from a lover or relative who has been prescribed the medication. The risk of addiction and the way fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, like opioid painkillers, have a better risk and cause addiction more quickly than others. As time passes, you'll need larger doses of the drug to urge high. Soon you'll need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you'll find that it's increasingly difficult to travel without the drug. Attempts to prevent drug use may cause intense cravings and cause you to feel physically ill (withdrawal symptoms). You may need help from your doctor, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program to beat your white plague and stay drug-free. Drug addiction isn’t about just heroin, cocaine, or other illegal drugs. You can get hooked in to alcohol, nicotine, opioid painkillers, and other legal substances. At first, you'll prefer to take a drug because you wish the way it causes you to feel. You may think you can control how much and how often you use it. But over time, drugs change how your brain works. These physical changes can last a long time. They make you lose self-control and may lead you to damaging behaviours.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Club drugs are typically taken by groups of people during raves. Raves are parties where the opportunity to dance to very loud, rhythmic music while under the influence of one or more drugs is the primary attraction. Needless to say, most users of club drugs under these conditions are young and single. Club drugs are usually taken periodically; several of them may be taken three to four times over the course of an 8-hour rave, and then they may not be taken again until the next opportunity to attend such a party. This is quite different from the pattern of opioid, nicotine, or alcohol abuse, where drug-seeking and drug-taking occur several times per day for months or years, or from the pattern of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse, where the drug may be taken as frequently as possible for several days of profound intoxication. In most cases, even periodic club drug use does not continue for more than a few years. For all but a few individuals, there is little indication that it is difficult to stop using these drugs. Some of the drugs, MDMA in particular, lose their ability to change the perceptions of some users in interesting ways, and these people effortlessly stop taking them. For these reasons, club drugs meet the criteria for abuse, but usually do not meet the criteria for addiction as these terms were defined in Chapter 1. Physiological dependence on some club drugs is possible, as noted below, but is rarely observed in people who take them only twice each week.",

      "abstract": "Substance misuse became a key area for social policy in the early 21st century where it was linked to a number of social problems including criminal activity, unemployment and anti-social behaviours. Misusing drugs applies to legal substances, such as alcohol, or illegal substances, like cannabis or cocaine. In the popular imagination, people who misuse substances are often seen to be the agents of their own problems and are believed to be ambivalent about changing their behaviour. For many people who are dependent on substances, the greatest harm is not to others, but to themselves. The impact on the body of excessive alcohol includes cirrhosis of the liver, cardiovascular problems, the destruction of brain cells, increased risk of cancer and diabetes, malnutrition, and sexual problems. Many people use substances to enhance pleasurable experiences; others come to rely on them as a mechanism for coping with life’s challenges, often from a young age, and substance use can lend a temporary boost in self-esteem or social confidence. Drug use becomes misuse when someone becomes dependent or the use becomes problematic or harmful to themselves or others. Many people use drugs on a regular basis while maintaining their employment and continuing to effectively parent their children.",

This study aims to determine whether adolescents high in trait social anxiety report more cigarette use and greater urge to smoke before, during, and after friend interactions than do teens low in trait social anxiety. Four hundred two students who reported smoking more than once during high school were assessed approximately every 30 min during up to 84-day monitoring sessions. Controlling for momentary anxiety, high socially anxious teens were equally or less likely to smoke, but more likely to report urge to smoke, surrounding friend interactions than low socially anxious teens. Although high socially anxious adolescents do not smoke more than low socially anxious peers, they may believe that they should need a cigarette in anxiety-provoking situations.

It is not uncommon for adolescents to experiment with different substances such as alcohol or cigarettes, but this can lead to heavy and continued use, which is dangerous and may put their health at risk. Additionally, individuals who drink and smoke are more likely to participate in other risky behaviors, including using other drugs or driving after drinking. Adolescents may turn to substance use when they are under stress at home or at school, or when their friends are smoking or drinking. TOBACCO USE Tobacco can be used in the form of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or smokeless tobacco. Using tobacco at a young age increases the risk of addiction and later health problems. E About one-quarter of high school students reported having smoked a cigarette before the age of 13, and more than one-third of high school students reported smoking cigarettes in the past 30 days. 1 E Tobacco use has been associated with many health problems, including heart disease and cancer, 2 and is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. 3",

      "title": "Addicted women: when your patient can't stop drinking, smoking, shopping, eating.",
      "abstract": "While they do not necessarily present the same health risk, such other problems as compulsive shopping and eating have similarly serious implications for both physical and emotional health. All of these behaviors share a common theme reflecting difficulty with impulse control. In some cases, identifying patients with impulse control problems is straightforward; the pack of cigarettes or nicotine stains are easily visible, or the patient's weight can be measured in the office. Other problems, such as alcohol abuse or compulsive shopping, are less observable. To further compound the difficulty with identification is the fact that physicians may not ask routinely about the existence of such problems. Whether a practitioner inquires about the existence of these or other impulse control problems may be related to the difficulty one faces when the problem is finally identified. Addictive behaviors and impulse control disorders are notoriously difficult to treat. High relapse rates and the frustration of both patient and health care provider when efforts to change fail are a testimonial to the tenacity of these behaviors. Recent research highlighting how to meet patients at their level of readiness to change a risk-related behavior offers a perspective on what clinicians can do to assist their patients in approaching and ultimately changing these behaviors. The stages of change model will be described as a method for conceptualizing how behavior change can be facilitated in patients with these various problems. In addition, issues relevant to making a referral will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Vaping refers to the inhalation of aerosols produced in devices that heat liquid solutions. The aerosols may contain various additives, flavours, nicotine and other drugs such as cannabis. Nicotine is the most common psychoactive substance in devices (or e-cigarettes) in Canada. While has been viewed primarily as a cessation method or harm reduction strategy for smokers of combustible tobacco cigarettes, a new pattern is becoming evident in adolescents and youth (age 15-24) in Canada. In this age group, is reported in increasing frequencies among those who have never smoked. This suggests the possible emergence of a de novo pattern of substance use and suggests the emergence of an unmet treatment need, cessation. The mental health implications of are largely unknown but available data suggest that is associated with mental health changes similar to those seen with combustible tobacco cigarettes. Understanding the mental health impact of vaping will be challenging and research is needed. An important message from the smoking literature is that data from randomized cessation trials may be especially valuable because of complex issues of temporality and confounding connected to observational data.",

      "abstract": "Background: Synthetic tobacco is a type of tobacco made from a mixture of chemicals.This mixture is then sprayed on pieces of leaves or tobacco cigarettes and then rolled like using marijuana by smoking.Its chemicals are deliberately artificially created to mimic the effects of marijuana or ecstasy.The effects of synthetic tobacco include excessive pleasure, hallucinations, confusion, anxiety, and dependence (addictive). Method:We selected several references from textbooks and journals until 2023 containing information about synthetic cannabinoids.Case report: An 18-year-old man used synthetic tobacco for one year and claimed to feel calm after consuming it, which caused a desire to continue consuming it every day until the last two weeks.The patient was known to consume this synthetic tobacco more often than usual, so the patient experienced hallucinations and continued to want to consume this type of tobacco.The patient experiences symptoms of auditory hallucinations.The patient also feels anxious, looks confused, and feels like a gorilla hit him because it made his body stiff, and he was unable to move. Conclusion:Some signs and symptoms overlap between cannabis and synthetic cannabis.Doctors who confirmed the use of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) need to be vigilant in providing supportive care and can perform supporting examinations to support diagnosis if needed.",

Jika efek ini terus terjadi, tubuh akan kejang-kejang, muncul halusinasi, perilaku lebih agresif, dan rasa sesak pada bagian dada. Jangka panjang dari dampak dehidrasi ini dapat menyebabkan kerusakan pada otak. Tidak hanya itu saja, dalam dosis berlebih juga bisa menyebabkan muntah, mual, rasa takut yang berlebih, serta gangguan kecemasan. Apabila pemakaian dalam jangka panjang, bisa mengakibatkan dampak yang lebih buruk seperti gangguan mental, depresi, serta kecemasan terus-menerus. Pemakai yang menggunakan obat-obatan tersebut dalam dosis yang berlebih, efeknya justru membuat tubuh terlalu rileks sehingga kesadaran berkurang drastis. Beberapa kasus si pemakai tidur secara terus-menerus dan tidak bangun-bangun. Hilangnya kesadaran tersebut membuat koordinasi tubuh terganggu, sering bingung, dan terjadi perubahan perilaku. Dampak narkoba yang cukup berisiko tinggi adalah hilangnya ingatan sehingga sulit mengenali lingkungan sekitar. Dampak narkoba yang paling buruk terjadi jika si pemakai menggunakan obat-obatan tersebut dalam dosis yang tinggi atau yang dikenal dengan overdosis. Pemakaian sabu-sabu, opium, dan kokain bisa menyebabkan tubuh kejang-kejang dan jika dibiarkan dapat menimbulkan kematian. Inilah akibat fatal yang harus dihadapi jika sampai kecanduan narkotika, nyawa menjadi taruhannya. Bahaya narkoba bukan hanya berdampak buruk bagi kondisi tubuh, penggunaan obat-obatan tersebut juga bisa mempengaruhi kualitas hidup misalnya susah berkonsentrasi saat bekerja, mengalami masalah keuangan, hingga harus berurusan dengan pihak kepolisian jika terbukti melanggar hukum. Pemakaian zat-zat narkotika hanya diperbolehkan untuk kepentingan medis sesuai dengan pengawasan dokter dan juga untuk keperluan penelitian. Selebihnya, obat-obatan tersebut tidak memberikan dampak positif bagi tubuh. Yang ada, kualitas hidup menjadi terganggu, relasi dengan keluarga kacau, kesehatan menurun, dan yang paling buruk adalah menyebabkan kematian. Karena itu, jangan coba-coba memakai barang berbahaya tersebut karena resikonya sangat tinggi bagi hidup dan kesehatan.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Tobacco Use and Alcohol Consumption among Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a period in the life of an individual from 10 years to 19 years of age. This stage is marked by rapid physical, cognitive, and psychosocial growth in an individual and is a very crucial stage for their development. This is the time when the foundations of a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle are laid, and these habits may continue for a lifetime. Current research studies show high growth in the number of adolescents involved in risky behaviors, and this has become a matter of concern. The prevalence of risks in alcohol and tobacco consumption has increased tremendously. Tobacco and alcohol are known to be ‘gateway drugs’ as they are the first to be consumed when an individual starts such practices; the reasons are their easy availability, peer influences, acculturation, or even family history of substance use disorder. To decrease this and establish a healthy lifestyle, teenagers need proper information and guidance, including opportunities that may lead them to actively participate in interventions that are aimed to improve their physical and mental health. Mostly, alcohol and tobacco are seen to be prevalent together. Adolescents who show consistent drinking and tobacco smoking habits are more likely to show irritant, violent behaviors. Also, they are at higher risk of developing drug habits like marijuana abuse in their later stages of life.This chapter basically examines the generality of tobacco and alcohol consumption, especially among adolescents, and the ways in which it causes harm to adolescents and its side effects. It gives an overview of the social, physical, and psychological effects it has on adolescents’ lifestyles. It also covers risk factors and smoking and alcohol cessation efforts in the population. It gives special consideration to smoking cessation treatment, which includes peer influences, motivation, and nicotine dependence.",

      "title": "The Harms and Prevention of Drugs and Alcohol on Children",
      "abstract": "Children risk harming themselves when they consume drugs or alcohol, as these psychoactive substances are associated with numerous adverse effects on their physical and psychological health and well-being. Children may also be profoundly affected by the misuse of drugs or alcohol by the people responsible for their care, most often parents. This too can also seriously affect their health and well-being, and all aspects of family life can be severely affected by substance misuse. The potential harms to children are both short and long term, and may have irrevocable consequences, whether these arise from consumption by the children themselves or from the collateral harms caused by their carers’ consumption. The range of psychoactive substances used recreationally is extensive in type and strength and thus in relative potential harm. It includes opioids, cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco. Alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis are the substances most commonly used by both adults and children. Across the world, psychoactive substances other than alcohol and tobacco are widely illegal, although many so-called legal highs (Novel Psychoactive Substances) can be found in countries where legislation has not kept up with the pace of development of novel substances. Moreover, some legally prescribed drugs, such as benzodiazepines, may be used illegally without a prescription. None are without attendant risks. While alcohol and tobacco are widely legal, most countries regulate their production, purchase, and use, in part with a view to protecting children. A minimum age is usually specified for their legal purchase and, for tobacco, many developed countries now ban smoking in all enclosed public spaces to protect both the adults and children around the users. Broadly speaking, around three quarters of adults, outside “dry” countries, consume alcohol, so most children grow up in an environment where alcohol use by parents is normalized. Around a quarter of adults smoke tobacco, so proportionately fewer children are similarly exposed to parental use. Figures for adult use of illicit drugs vary, but around 1% of children probably grow up with parental drug use. This article addresses the use and known harms to children from legal and illegal substances. The readings included provide a selection of the available literature. For the purposes of these readings, “children” is interpreted to address individuals aged up to 18 years of age, including fetuses in utero, and the known effects of alcohol and drugs on this age group. However, the citations used may define “children” in other ways and may include age ranges that extend beyond 18.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Aging, a wearing‐out process which affects everything inanimate and animate, is accelerated by abuse or decelerated by care. The psychologic reactions of aging persons vary considerably. The concept of growing older is much more satisfactory and pleasant than the concept of being old, since the former is applicable to everyone regardless of age whereas the latter carries a finite significance as deterioration progresses. Chronologic age is much less important than biologic age. The desideratum is not longevity but rather a long, useful and meaningful life. Although heredity is of importance in longevity, it is a factor over which at present we have no control. However, we can influence the aging process according to whether we care for or abuse the body. The principal factors in accelerated aging, in order of importance, are: 1) tobacco use (particularly cigarette smoking), 2) lack of exercise, and 3) obesity. Conversely, abstinence from tobacco, exercise within tolerance, and avoidance of obesity not only decelerate aging but result in a better quality of life.",

It discusses the relationships between alcohol use and personnel security, the prevalence of alcohol use and abuse, indicators of alcohol dependence and abuse, the relationships of alcohol problems to other forms of problem behavior, and treatment effectiveness and relapse rates. About 10% of adult Americans have a serious alcohol problem. Excessive alcohol consumption may impair judgement and increase the risk of accidental, careless or even deliberate disclosure of classified information. Motivation for using alcohol or any other drug is one of the most potent predictors of future use or problems with that drug. If the motivation is experimentation, peer pressure, or adolescent rebelliousness, this does not necessarily lead to future abuse. To the extent that alcohol is used as a means of coping with life's problems, such as stress or low self-esteem, then one can expect that the alcohol consumption itself may eventually become a source of future problems. Solitary drinking is far more predictive of future problems than social drinking. So is drinking prior to social events(to relax), as compared with alcohol use at social events.",

Patients who usually smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day also drank more alcohol and more tea or coffee than others. Heavy smoking and the frequent drinking of tea or coffee were associated with later times of going to bed at night but not with insomnia. Alcohol consumption was unrelated to any aspect of sleep habits. These findings are consistent with the view that heavy smokers tend to be more extroverted than non-smokers and seek arousal both by out-going social activities and by the use of stimulant drugs such as nicotine and caffeine. However, heavy smokers do not necessarily suffer from long-term emotional distress which would cause insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Treating addiction is more challenging when there are co-addictions. Tobacco smoking is commonly associated with substance abuse, alcohol use disorders, excessive caffeine intake and pathological gambling among other addictions. Smoking reduction and cessation programmes´ objectives benefit from interventions targeting co-addictions. Objectives Difficulties arising from smoking reduction and cessation in the context of co-use of cannabis prompt literature review and reflection of a smoking cessation programme team. Methods Pubmed and Google Scholar literature search using terms smoking cessation / tobacco cessation and cannabis. Results Co-use of tobacco and cannabis is: 1) very common, 2) associated with greater prevalence of morbidity and social problems, 3) associated with greater dependence of the other substances, 4) negatively influences quit outcomes of either, 5) increases the risk of relapse. Co-users are more likely to perceive the harmful effects of tobacco, have greater motivation and are more likely to quit tobacco than cannabis, which may be perceived as low risk. Treatment of either tobacco smoking or cannabis use may lead to compensatory increase in use of the other substance. There is a significant lack of literature on co-use treatment strategies. Conclusions Co-use of tobacco and cannabis makes cessation and relapse prevention of either addiction more difficult and should be taken into account in smoking reduction and cessation programmes and in cannabis treatment interventions. Treatment targetting both tobacco and cannabis use, either simultaneously or sequentially, is likely more successful than interventions targeting only either one. Much remais to be studied on how to treat co-use of tobacco and cannabis.",

Substance use is defined as taking a substance into the body for an intended purpose, such as behavioural or emotional change. According to, substance users are individuals who have rejected imposed cultural goals and the means to achieve those goals. Alcohol, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and tobacco/nicotine among many others have been the major substances used among adolescents and young adult population especially in Nigeria. According to use of substances may occur without having a significant impact on an individual’s functioning, but when tolerance is built and use increases, even at the expense of work or school, relationships, or one’s own health or safety, this can indicate a substance use disorder.",

      "abstract": "Three cases of methamphetamine abuse by smoking were reported. The oral intake and the intravenous injection of the drug are usually adopted, and the smoking is recently found among the stimulant abusers in Japan. The stimulant is heated on a piece of aluminium foil with a lighter and its smoke is inhaled with a straw or a paper pipe. The intake means are identical to \"crystal or ice\" in Hawaii, although a special glass pipe or a cigarette is not used here. The effect of the drug obtained by smoking is more slack and mild than that by a intravenous injection, although the drug of the double dose is used in the smoking. Two cases changed the intake means from the injection to the smoking because of no guilty feeling and a lack of injection marks and evident proofs of illegal use. Therefore, abuse of methamphetamine by smoking is thought to increase in near future in Japan, and the delusion of arrest by policemen observed frequently in the stimulant abusers maybe decreases as a result of a decrease in the psychological stress of guilty.",

      "title": "39 Binge Drinking: Not an Innocent Problem",
      "abstract": "More and more paediatricians are confronted with teen drinking and the problems that result from it. A new trend is the so called “binge-drinking”. This means consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol in a very short period of time with the goal of getting drunk as fast as possible. Within 1 hour after ingestion, alcohol is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. Toxic effects of alcohol can occur from a plasma concentration of 0.5–1‰ (= 500–1000 mg/l) or an intake of 600 mg/kg alcohol. This is equal to ingestion of 120 ml liquor (alcohol concentration 30%) in an adolescent of 40kg. The effects are caused by a suppression of the central nervous system and they occur faster in younger people than in adults due to less extracellular volume. Also individual factors like gender, use of other medications or drugs and drinking habits play a role. All this factors can result in a broad spectrum of symptoms (relaxation, altered perception of the environment, prolonged reaction time, amnesia, nausea, vomiting and in more severe cases respiratory depression, coma and death). When a child with possible alcohol intoxication is admitted to the emergency department, general “APLS” guidelines (Advanced Pediatric Life Support) should be followed. After the “acute” event of the alcohol intoxication, multidisciplinary follow-up of the patient is very important. In Belgium, no objective data exist on the problem of binge drinking whilst among paediatricians there is great concern about it. Therefore, we will conduct a national survey on this topic.",

Sie werden millionenfach in Deutschland missbraucht, um von den Alltagsproblemen abzulenken. Seit Jahrzehnten ist bekannt, dass die Mitglieder aus den unteren sozialen Schichten der Gesellschaft mit geringeren beruflichen Qualifizierungen davon zu einem größeren Teil betroffen sind als Menschen mit höheren Schul- und Hochschulabschlüssen. Besondere Zielgruppen für Tabak und Alkohol sind zeitweilig oder langzeitig Arbeitslose sowie allein lebende Menschen. Wenn es um das Rauchen geht, werden Kinder und Frauen davon mehr betroffen als Männer. Die Vereinsamung des Menschen, oft einhergehend mit dem Auftreten depressiver Reaktionen oder von Depressionen, begünstigt den Griff zur Zigarette. Sozial schwache Menschen geben bis zu 20 % ihres Einkommens für Tabakwaren aus. In zahlreichen Industrieländern wird der Zeitpunkt des Rauchbeginns in immer frühere Lebensjahre verlegt, wodurch vermeidbare Erkrankungen in immer früheren Lebensjahren zu beobachten sind. Das bedeutet, dass vermeidbare Erkrankungen über immer längere Zeiträume medizinisch versorgt werden müssen. In den kommenden Jahren müssen wirksame Präventionsprogramme gegen das Rauchen insbesondere für die sozioökonomisch schlecht gestellten Bevölkerungsteile entwickelt werden, um die Finanzierbarkeit der Gesundheitssysteme in den kommenden Jahrzehnten überhaupt noch zu ermöglichen.",

In recent years, the problem of drug abuse among youth has reached epidemic proportions. India has become a country of drug culture. They use drug on awaking (coffee or tea), throughout the day (cigarettes, certain soft drinks) as a way to relax (alcohol) and to reduce pain (aspirin). In our youth group become more attractive toward substance abuse and different types of drug for pleasure and entertainment. They do not know the impact of substance and drug abuse. Drug abuse can lead to drug dependence or addiction. Drug dependence arises out of a maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to a cluster of behavioural, cognitive and psychological phenomenon that develops after repeated intake. It includes a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences. Higher priority is given to drug use than other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal state. Total 400 (200 Drug users and 200 Non-drug users) were taken from different four colleges situated in Darbhanga district of north Bihar area. The age ranges of sample were from 18 to 25 years with an average age range of 22 years. The purposive sampling technique was adhered during sample selection time.",

      "title": "Sleep: A Nightmare",
      "abstract": "Common Causes of Sleeplessness Include: (1) Stress – Concerns about work, school, health, finances, or family can keep your mind active at night, making it difficult to sleep. Stressful life events or trauma – such as the death or illness of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss can lead to stress. (2) Travel or work schedule – Disrupting your body’s circadian rhythms can lead to lack of sleep. Causes include jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late or early shift, or frequently changing shifts. (3) Poor sleep habits – Poor sleep habits include an irregular bedtime schedule, naps, stimulating activities before bed, an uncomfortable sleep environment, and using your bed for work, eating, or watching TV. Computers, TVs, video games, smartphones, or other screens just before bed can interfere with your sleep cycle. (4) Eating too much late in the evening – Having a light snack before bedtime is OK, but eating too much may cause you to feel physically uncomfortable while lying down. Many people also experience heartburn, a backflow of acid, and food from the stomach into the esophagus after eating, which may keep you awake. (5) Mental health disorders – Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, may disrupt your sleep. Awakening too early can be a sign of depression. (6) Medications – Many prescription drugs can interfere with sleep, such as certain antidepressants and medications for asthma or blood pressure. Many over-the-counter medications – such as some pain medications, allergy, and cold medications, and weight loss products – contain caffeine and other stimulants that can disrupt sleep. (7) Medical conditions – Examples of conditions linked with insomnia include chronic pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), overactive thyroid, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. (8) Sleep-related disorders – Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing periodically throughout the night, interrupting your sleep. Restless legs syndrome causes unpleasant sensations in your legs and an almost irresistible desire to move them, which may prevent you from falling asleep. (9) Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol – Coffee, tea, cola, and other caffeinated drinks are stimulants. Drinking them in the late afternoon or evening can keep you from falling asleep at night. Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can interfere with sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often causes awakening in the middle of the night. Complications of Insomnia May Include: (1) Lower performance on the job or at school. (2) Slowed reaction time while driving and a higher risk of accidents. (3) Mental health disorders, such as depression, an anxiety disorder, or substance abuse. (4) Increased risk and severity of long-term diseases or conditions, such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Prevention: Good sleep habits can help prevent insomnia and promote sound sleep: (1) Keep your bedtime and wake time consistent from day to day, including weekends. (2) Stay active – regular activity helps promote a good night’s sleep. (3) Check your medications to see if they may contribute to insomnia. (4) Avoid or limit naps. (5) Avoid or limit caffeine and alcohol, and do not use nicotine. (6) Avoid large meals and beverages before bedtime. (7) Make your bedroom comfortable for sleep and only use it for sex or sleep. (8) Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading, or listening to soft music. Conclusion: Sleep deprivation is helping no one except the market. Brands are capitalizing on our lack of sleep, on our habits. Who are we giving excuses to, our web series can be paused, late night conversation can",

Frequent users of smokeless tobacco have an increased risk of developing gingival recession, leukoplakia, and oral cancer at the placement site. Other health concerns are related to the cardiovascular effects and addictive nature of nicotine. Because the smokeless tobacco habit is difficult to break, public health efforts have been largely aimed at prevention. The dental professional also can play an important role in recognizing the smokeless tobacco user and facilitating cessation.",

Malgre la connaissance generale des risques lies a la consommation de tabac et l'envie de la majorite des fumeurs d'arreter de fumer, pres de 20% de notre population selon les dernieres enquetes restent fumeurs. Il est en effet difficile d'arreter de fumer car le tabac est une drogue responsable d'une dependance psychologique et, selon la quantite fumee, d'une dependance physique. La prise en charge globale du tabagisme devra donc stimuler et entretenir la motivation a l'arret, assurer un accompagnement psychologique pendant et apres la periode de sevrage et traiter la dependance physique. La motivation, variable en fonction du stade de maturation du fumeur, est essentielle lors de l'arret du tabac. Stimuler et entretenir la motivation necessite resonance, empathie et ecoute active lors d'entretiens motivationnels par exemple. La dependance psychologique est liee au plaisir de fumer, a la gestion du stress ou de l'appetit en fumant, a la detente, a la convivialite, au geste, a l'habitude. L'accompagnement psychologique faisant appel notamment aux therapies cognitivo-comportementales veillera des lors a aider le fumeur a gerer le stress, a vivre positivement et a s'affirmer. D'autres aides paralleles ayant un effet placebo peuvent etre utiles telles l'homeopathie, l'hypnose ou l'acupuncture. La nicotine est le principal compose de la fumee de tabac responsable de la dependance physique, par fixation sur les neurones dopaminergiques de la zone de recompense du cerveau, mimant l'action de l'acetylcholine. Cette fixation favorise la liberation de divers neuromediateurs impliques dans les phenomenes de l'humeur. Lors de l'arret, le fumeur dependant peut souffrir d'un syndrome de sevrage. Cette dependance physique peut etre evaluee sur base de questionnaire, du test de Fagerstrom ou de dosages biologiques. Jusqu'a present, le bupropion et les substituts nicotiniques voire la nortriptyline sont des medications recommandees pour leur efficacite dans l'aide a l'arret du tabac. Certains phenomenes annexes frequents lors de l'arret du tabac ne sont pas a negliger: la prise de poids et l'apparition d'une tendance depressive voire d'une depression. Le suivi dietetique et de l'humeur est important, necessitant parfois une prise en charge specifique et un traitement. Le sevrage tabagique est donc un phenomene complexe impliquant des mecanismes psychiques et physiopathologiques que nous devons connaitre afin de pouvoir aider efficacement le fumeur non seulement lors de l'arret du tabac mais aussi afin de prevenir la rechute.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Some abstinent smokers develop withdrawal symptoms when they stop using nicotine gum or when placebo is substituted; thus, physical dependence on nicotine gum does occur. Some smokers also use nicotine gum beyond the recommended period; thus, behavioral dependence on the gum occurs. Many (7–41 %) smokers misuse nicotine gum by smoking cigarettes and chewing the gum concurrently. Among smokers who stop using the gum, many (35–90 %) do not stop gum use by the recommended 3 months, and a substantial percentage (13–38 %) persist in gum use for 1 year. Among quitters, long-term use of nicotine gum appears to be greater than that of placebo gum. If rapidity of onset and frequency of use are determinants of dependence potential, then nasal sprays and aerosols but not nicotine patches should have dependence potential. There are no reports of misuse of the gum by non-smokers; thus, the gum appears to have little if any abuse liability.",

O tabagismo constitui um problema de Saude Publica, que e capaz de gerar impacto. Compoem a fumaca produzida pelos cigarros cerca de 4.700 substâncias prejudiciais a saude. Os componentes misturados presentes nos cigarros incluem metais pesados, acidos e solventes orgânicos, entre outros, que produzem fumaca que quando inalada pode levar a problemas de saude. No cigarro existe a presenca da nicotina, alcatrao, do plutonio, monoxido de carbono, nitrosaminas, cadmio, arsenio, o cianeto de hidrogenio e os policiclicos. A dependencia quimica pelo consumo dos cigarros provem da nicotina, que e uma droga psicoativa. A nicotina constitui o principal empecilho da pratica do tabagismo, uma vez que a mesma provoca muitos problemas, incluindo alguns em âmbito odontologico, tais como: adesao aos dentes e capacidade de adentrar na cavidade bucal nos tecidos moles. O tabagismo pode promover manifestacoes sistemicas e bucais indesejaveis. A nivel odontologico pode ocorrer maior acumulo de biofilme dentario; câncer bucal; halitose; decrescimo na resposta imunologica e inflamatoria; imunossupressao; doencas periodontais; maior profundidade em bolsas periodontais; recessao gengival; perda de insercao periodontal; perdas dentarias; reabsorcao do rebordo alveolar; perda ossea alveolar aumentada; hipossalivacao; restauracoes dentarias e proteses dentarias pigmentadas e manchamento em lingua, dentes e na mucosa em decorrencia. O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar como o tabagismo pode afligir a saude oral dos usuarios. Realizou-se estudo de revisao bibliografica com levantamento nas bases de dados: PubMED, Google Academico envolvendo busca por estudos e artigos que versavam acerca das implicacoes odontologicas ocasionadas pelo tabagismo. O tabagismo deve ser abandonado e para promover auxilio e orientacoes aos tabagistas todo profissional de saude contactante, incluindo o cirurgiao dentista deve alertar esses pacientes sobre os possiveis maleficios sistemicos que podem ser ocasionados pela droga. O cirurgiao dentista pode enfatizar tambem danos que podem ser gerados a saude bucal. A cessacao do consumo dos cigarros auxilia na melhora da qualidade de vida e promove melhora no estado de saude sistemica e bucal apresentado.",

      "abstract": "Research shows that problem behaviors manifested early tend to persist into later life. Problem drinking does not necessarily commit the young adolescent to a life course of this behavior, but it does alter the probabilities. Conversely, early abstinence is a strong predictor of later healthful behavior. An important observation is that alcohol and other drug use tends to decrease along with smoking decreases. Young adolescents tend to believe that most of their peers engage in a particular type of behavior whether that is the actual case or not. There is a tendency across populations of adolescents to overestimate such behaviors by a factor of six or eight. In one study, school children estimated that about two-thirds of their peers smoked while the actual figure was about one-tenth. Adolescents tend to have weak orientation to the future, especially in regard to consequences of risk-taking behavior. College-bound adolescents tend to have a longer view of the future than those who do not pursue college, but in general adolescents think, \"It can't happen to me,\" or, \"It's so far off that I just can't think about it.\" They are focused on the here and now. Many youngsters when they think about it have a dismal view of the future. They are doubtful about their own ability to influence events in ways that build toward a rewarding life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Gangs, Drug Use, and Drug Selling in the United States",
      "abstract": "Gangs and drugs are two major criminological issues that come together in the United States. On the one hand, gang members use more drugs than non-gang youth, so much so that gang membership itself is an indicator that an individual will have a significant drug use profile. Compared with non-gang youth, gang members also begin to use drugs at earlier ages, use a greater variety of drugs, use them with greater frequency, and participate in other risk behaviors (e.g., violence, unsafe sexual behaviors) while intoxicated. Alcohol and marijuana feature prominently within the drug use repertoires of gang members, and the latter is considered normalized within gang cultures. Gang members also use other “hard” drugs, such as crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and heroin, despite the fact that the use of such drugs is stigmatized among them. Gang membership is also characterized by polysubstance use—the simultaneous or sequential use of a variety of drugs, as well as nonmedical prescription drug misuse. As a result, gang members are at great risk of many negative social and health consequences related to drug use. On the other hand, gang members sell drugs. A wealth of academic data contradicts the legal and public perceptions about this relationship. First, a commonly held view is that gangs control a majority of the sales of illegal drugs within any one area. However, this clashes with research specifically on gangs, which reveals that few members within any one gang sell drugs and that few gangs are specifically focused on selling drugs. Another area where academic research conflicts with widely held perceptions is the idea that drug selling is a lucrative endeavor for gang members. While the public and law enforcement agencies may believe gang members are making significant amounts of money selling drugs, research indicates that the majority of gang members who do sell drugs do not appear to earn significantly more money than they could earn working the same number of hours at a job paying minimum wage. Such findings further argue that such amounts hardly seem worth the risk given the large numbers of gang members killed or imprisoned in relation to selling drugs.",

Marijuana smoking deposits 4x times more tar in the lungs as compared to tobacco smoke and amount of some pro-carcinogens are up to 2x times greater in marijuana tar. Determination of Dependence/Physical Harm relationship by investigators shows a proximity of cannabis to khat, LSD, ecstasy, alkyl nitrites, and methylphenidate. Non-users that are exposed to cannabis inhalant may suffer loss of coordination, dizziness, confusion, difficulty walking, blurred vision, and vomiting. Illicit drug use has been shown to be strongly associated with homicide events. Psychotropic effects from THC inhalant reaches a maximum after 15 to 30 minutes. Psychotropic effects from oral ingestion of THC reaches maximum level after 2 to 3 hours. Marijuana smoke contains higher levels of specific toxins than tobacco smoke. Ongoing research outcome challenges the concept that marijuana smoke is less harmful than tobacco smoke. Marijuana smoke causes lung damage quickly and could out pace tobacco smoke by as much as 20 years. Studies has shown cannabis usage worsens the course of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and that adolescents possess a greater risk from cannabis than older individuals. Cannabis abuse could be an independent risk factor for the further development of psychotic disorders. Further research and study is warranted concerning clinical application of cannabis.  2010 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA",

Many other factors usually override health concerns, especially if the negative health effects have a low probability of occurring, or if they are likely to occur only far in the future. Many people often make poor decisions about personal health risks even when the risks are substantial, the impact is dramatic, or the effect occurs immediately or in the near future. For example, many people decide to smoke or chew tobacco in spite of the substantial and documented risk of serious health problems caused by tobacco use.

In both conditions, a non-deprived baseline was followed by performance tests 2, 6 and 24 h later, while subjective feelings were assessed every 2 h. Compared to normal smoking, abstinence led to reduced heart rate, worse task performance, feelings of depression, stress, irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, and urges to smoke. Letter cancellation and number vigilance task performance were significantly poorer after 2 and 6 h of abstinence. Subjective feeling states were significantly worse after 4 h of abstinence, and became increasingly impaired over the rest of the day. However many abstinence symptoms (except heart rate), were reduced in severity at the 24-h session, held on the morning of the following day. This suggests that many of the psychological effects of smoking abstinence, may build-up afresh each day.",

It represents a \"minor addiction\" with the origin within the society. This is the result of an analysis of motives leading to smoking. Social habits, examples, deprivation of senses, dullness, anxiety, stress, and smoking as a symbol of status play a major role. 3. Stress carries a dual risk, it encourages to smoking and it exerts direct effects an organ function. 4. Smoking is enhanced by its somatic effects which activate in turn again smoking.

Perhaps it is this latter element - the feeling of pleasure - that poses one of the greatest challenges to the development of successful drug strategies and health promotion messages.

Instructions regarding the nicotine content of the cigarette varied across sessions, and all participants were exposed to a neutral cue followed by a smoking cue after cigarette consumption. Craving was assessed before and after cigarette consumption and cue exposure.Reduced intentions to smoke were associated with both nicotine expectancy (p<0.05) and nicotine administration (p<0.01), while reduced withdrawal-related craving was uniquely associated with nicotine administration (p<0.05). Smoking-associated stimuli increased craving regardless of nicotine expectancy or administration (p-values<0.001).While both nicotine pharmacology and expectancy appear to contribute to craving reduction associated with acute tobacco smoking, neither smoking-related nicotine administration nor expectation prevents increases in craving following exposure to smoking-associated stimuli. These findings suggest that cue-induced craving may be resistant to various pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

Among populations involved in drug abuse and predatory crime, a temporal sequence from drug abuse to predatory criminality is not typical; on the contrary, predatory criminality more commonly occurs before drug abuse. Drug-abusing offenders who display increasingly deviant behavior over time may eventually cross over a threshold to heroin addiction or frequent polydrug abuse. The intensity of their criminal behavior typically escalates substantially. If these high-rate offenders subsequently decrease the amount of drugs they use, they typically also lessen their rate of criminal activity. Among offenders who use multiple types of drugs, individual predatory crime commission frequencies are typically two or three times higher among offenders when they use multiple types of drugs than they are for the same offenders when they are in drug treatment or abstain from drug abuse.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Imitation/non‐imitation by adult offspring of alcohol‐related parent behavior was examined in the context of the fall‐off effect’ and of sensible/problem alcohol use, two processes which tend to constrain drinking. Evidence indicates there is more imitation by adult offspring of abstemious parents (both abstainer and low volume) than of high volume parents. Adult offspring drink significantly less, on the average, than their high volume parents, a phenomenon here termed‘fall‐off effect’ for both men and women with respect to either their fathers or mothers. This fall‐off among social drinkers appears when the mother approaches or the father consumes at or more than a typical daily drinking level (≥1 drink per day). More sensible drinking occurs among adult offspring when (I) the parent has no drinking problem‐signs than when the parent has drinking problems (this pattern appears at all levels of offspring consumption), and (2) when parents drink at high volume and have no problems for those offspring who do not imitate parent volume. Drinking “sensibly’ appears to be associated directly with the level of parent alcohol use and offsprings’ own drinking levels (considered as imitation or non‐imitation of parents), and indirectly with offspring recall of problematic intake by parents. Drinking sensibly is a medical, education and public health issue.",

      "abstract": "Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder that affects women 9-10 times more often than men.It has three key features:x Intense preoccupation with body weight and shape x Repetitive episodes of binge eating (uncontrollably eating a large quantity of food in a defined period-usually less than two hours)x Routinely taking extreme measures to prevent weight gain, including self induced vomiting, fasting, excessive exercise, and misuse of laxatives and diuretics.The condition is characterised by the patient's inability to control the urge to indulge in binge eating.Medical complications are caused by the weight reducing behaviours, particularly vomiting and laxative misuse.The frequency of these behaviours is, on average, at least twice a week for three months.Episodes may be spontaneous or planned and can be triggered by stress, intense hunger, or dysphoria.Patients are usually in the normal weight range. TreatmentDespite the availability of effective treatments, few people with bulimia nervosa seek help.One study found that only 1 in 10 people with the condition are in treatment. 1 Treatments that are likely to workAntidepressants Antidepressants can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.There is not enough evidence on how long the benefits last or for comparing the effects of different classes of antidepressants.Antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy are equally effective for bulimia nervosa, though dropout rates are higher with antidepressants, probably due to their side effects.For information on drug doses, see www.besttreatments.org/bulimianervosa. Cognitive behaviour therapyAs with antidepressants, cognitive behaviour therapy can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.It may be preferable to medication in patients who are sensitive to, or wish to avoid, side effects of medication.Cognitive behaviour therapy and other psychological treatments seem to be equally good at treating binge eating, although cognitive behaviour therapy is better at improving depression scores.There is some evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy has long term benefits in treating bulimia, but there is insufficient evidence about patients' characteristics that predict response.",

      "abstract": "An oral habit is a practice which may be constant or may be occasional, that has been acquired by frequent repetition. Life threatening oral habits can be either tobacco involving habits or non-tobacco involving habits. Most of the life-threatening diseases occurring due to oral habits have aetiology of tobacco usage with few instances of non-tobacco induced. Tobacco whether consumed as smoked form or smokeless form, affects the human body in one way or the other. These habits developed by the body can be peer pressure induced, stress induced, can be due to social stigma or can even be a habit that once started as an adventure has now converted into a compulsion. Favourably there are various therapies available for managing tobacco abuse that can ultimately curb the deadly situation arising after tobacco use, hence decreasing the rate of occurrence of various preventable diseases as well as increasing the life expectancy of the masses. This review article focuses on the various tobacco and non-tobacco induced oral habits that can be life threatening for the human body, consequences of these habits, their treatment and management.",

      "title": "Cotinine: Beyond that Expected, More than a Biomarker of Tobacco Consumption",
      "abstract": "A greater incidence of tobacco consumption occurs among individuals with psychiatric conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia, compared with the general population. Even when still controversial, it has been postulated that smoking is a form of self-medication that reduces psychiatric symptoms among individuals with these disorders. To better understand the component(s) of tobacco-inducing smoking behavior, greater attention has been directed toward nicotine. However, in recent years, new evidence has shown that cotinine, the main metabolite of nicotine, exhibits beneficial effects over psychiatric symptoms and may therefore promote smoking within this population. Some of the behavioral effects of cotinine compared to nicotine are discussed here. Cotinine, which accumulates in the body as a result of tobacco exposure, crosses the blood-brain barrier and has different pharmacological properties compared with nicotine. Cotinine has a longer plasma half-life than nicotine and showed no addictive or cardiovascular effects in humans. In addition, at the preclinical level, cotinine facilitated the extinction of fear memory and anxiety after fear conditioning, improved working memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in a monkey model of schizophrenia. Altogether, the new evidence suggests that the pharmacological and behavioral effects of cotinine may play a key role in promoting tobacco smoking in individuals that suffer from psychiatric conditions and represents a new potential therapeutic agent against psychiatric conditions such as AD and PTSD.",

Recently this habit has been spread to all social classes and the age of initiation is being earlier, at younger ages. During the last decades heroin has been a drug restricted to marginal groups, a situation that however has changed in nowadays. Actually, young people is drinking an excess of alcohol and consuming also cannabis, cocaine and design drugs, specially during their recreational time.

With a different curing process and in the absence of combustion, several carcinogens are reduced, if not eliminated. Epidemiological studies in Sweden, where snus were developed and adopted by approximately 20% of males, have found few, if any, increases in oral/head cancers or cardiovascular risks. Although snus are considerably safer than cigarettes from the perspective of an individual smoker, from a broader societal perspective, at least three problems suggest the need for regulatory oversight: (1) Snus could serve as a “gateway” product for adolescents; (2) snus could serve as a temporary bridge/replacement product for smokers in situations in which cigarettes cannot be used, thus dampening their motivation to quit smoking; and (3) studies have found potentially heightened risks of pancreatic cancer, premature birth, dental disease, and oral lesions among users.",

He was highly nicotine dependent and had failed repeatedly to stop using nicotine gum use in the past. Within a week of commencing nicotine patches he was able to cease nicotine gum with minimal discomfort and has remained nicotine-free for 6 months, with abstinence confirmed biochemically. His severe sweating disorder rapidly resolved with cessation of the gum. Nicotine patches may be an effective treatment for long-term nicotine gum addiction.",

      "title": "Commitment Devices",
      "abstract": "Unhealthy behaviors are responsible for a high percentage of health care costs and poor health outcomes. In large companies, unhealthy behaviors by employees are considered an important challenge to affordable benefits coverage. Employers increasingly leverage incentives to encourage changes in employees’ health-related behaviors. In this viewpoint, the authors discuss the potential and the limitations of commitment devices, as distinct from incentives, to influence health behaviors. Many people intend to improve their health behaviors in the future, but when the future arrives, they fail to follow through. Many will precommit their “future selves” to follow-through by purchasing gym memberships or scheduling workouts with friends; persons with alcoholism take disulfiram in the morning so drinking alcohol in the evening will make them ill. The commitment devices increase the probability of individuals’ compliance with voluntarily imposed restrictions until they have accomplished their goals or their voluntarily imposed penalties for not reaching their goals. A common form of commitment device, also called a deposit or commitment contract, involves people voluntarily depositing money into accounts they can access again only if they accomplish a goal. These devices can help people lose weight, improve their diets, exercise more, and quit smoking. Such commitment devices have 2 basic features: people voluntarily use them and the devices link consequences to an individual’s failure to achieve preset goals. Commitment devices can be associated with various consequences. Immutable consequences cannot be reversed by future choices. They can have monetary aspects in which people risk losing their own money if, by a predetermined date, an independent assessor reports that they did not reach their goals. Commitment devices involving mutable consequences constrain future behaviors but allow people future latitude to mitigate the consequences. One form is temptation bundling or allowing people to restrict their access to instantly gratifying experiences only to occasions in which they engage in goal-consistent behaviors. Commitment devices are powerful tools for changing health behaviors, but they are underused. Maximizing the population health benefits of commitment devices requires increasing the numbers of people who use them and increasing their effectiveness. Health professionals can educate patients about the gap between intention and action. Making enrollment and participation as simple as possible by eliminating unnecessary complexity could also facilitate greater use of commitment devices. To improve population health, such devices need to be more effective. Often, health-relevant goals require changing long-term behavior even after an initial objective has been achieved. Research should investigate whether and how commitment devices can be effective tools to assist with long-term behavior change. Commitment devices can provide positive feedback as soon as people begin using them. One promising direction for future research involves leveraging the influence of existing social networks. Commitment devices that involve these networks by creating social consequences for failing to achieve goals can be implemented inexpensively. Patients are more successful at achieving their health goals when they have access to commitment devices. Strategies for achieving higher rates of ongoing engagement and sustained behavior change are needed for the devices to have widespread influence and benefit.",

      "title": "Alcohol use and preventing alcohol-related problems among young adults in the military",
      "abstract": "Heavy alcohol use is a significant problem in the military. Personnel often use alcohol in an attempt to cope with stress, boredom, loneliness, and the lack of other recreational activities. The easy availability of alcohol, ritualized drinking opportunities, and inconsistent policies contribute to a work culture that facilitates heavy and binge drinking in this population. Prevention strategies such as alcohol use policies combined with campaigns focusing on alcohol deglamorization, personal responsibility, and health promotion currently are being implemented to help reduce heavy alcohol use, but further research is needed to evaluate the effects of these efforts. Understanding the characteristics of military culture that encourage or allow heavy and binge drinking practices also will help in designing effective prevention approaches. KEY WORDS: military; military personnel; young adult; heavy drinking; binge drinking; causes of AODU (alcohol and other drug use); AODU susceptibility; work-related AOD issue; cultural patterns of drinking; AOD availability; workplace-based prevention; prevention of problematic AODU; targeted prevention; prevention campaign; alcoholic beverage distribution laws; expectancy; personal responsibility; health promotion ********** Relative to other substance use, heavy drinking (i.e., consuming five or more drinks per typical drinking occasion at least once a week) appears to be a particularly persistent problem in the military. Although illicit drug use and cigarette smoking both decreased significantly over the period from 1980 to 2002, heavy alcohol use did not show the same decline. In fact, heavy alcohol use increased significantly from 1998 to 2002 for the first time since 1988 (Bray et al. 2003). In 2002, 27 percent of young adults (i.e., 18- to 25-year-olds) in the military reported heavy drinking, compared with only 8.9 percent of 26- to 55-year-olds (Bray et al. 2003). Heavy drinking also is prevalent among those entering the military. A study tracking high school students into adulthood found that those who entered the military were more likely than other young adults to have been heavy drinkers in high school (Bachman et al. 1999). When controlling for marital status, living arrangements, pregnancy, and parenthood, military service itself seemed to contribute to the increases in drinking. A study of young adults entering the U.S. Navy in 1998 examined the degree to which their drinking patterns changed from pre-entry through the first 3 years of service (Ames et al. 2004). Before entering the military, approximately 26 percent of recruits (average age 19) reported frequent heavy drinking (i.e., consuming at least five drinks [for men] and at least four drinks [for women] per typical drinking occasion at least once a week throughout the previous year) (Ames et al. 2002a). At followup 2 years later, the overall prevalence of frequent heavy drinking (23 percent) within the study's cohort remained largely unchanged (Ames et al. 2004). The study found that 2 years into their military enlistment, heavy drinkers could be classified in near-equal numbers as (1) those who were pre-enlistment heavy drinkers and continued the same drinking pattern, and (2) those who were not pre-enlistment heavy drinkers but began heavy drinking after completing their training (Ames et al. 2004). These findings suggest that young adults in the military are at risk for alcohol-related problems, making them important candidates for alcohol-related prevention programs. This article reviews the prevalence of alcohol use among young adults in all four branches of the military, comparing their drinking rates with those of young adult civilians, whether or not they are enrolled full-time in college. Risk factors for heavy drinking among young adults in the military are discussed, along with strategies for reducing hazardous drinking among these young people. RATES OF ALCOHOL USE AMONG YOUNG MILITARY PERSONNEL Rates of heavy alcohol use among 18- to 25-year-old military personnel differ significantly by service branch and by gender, as shown in the accompanying table. …",

New patterns of cocaine abuse, such as the inhalation of vaporized cocaine base, the intravenous injection of cocaine hydrochloride and the smoking of coca paste, produce a brief elation that quickly gives way either to a return to the baseline mood or to displeasure, resulting in a strong desire to return to the momentary ecstatic experience, a cycle that leads to compulsive use. The enormous profits made from illicit traffic in cocaine lead to corruption, violence and political destabilization. The individual costs of cocaine abuse include loss of personal fortunes, jobs and families. The safety of cocaine use is a myth. There are a number of ways in which cocaine can be lethal. The high doses of cocaine abused today induce physical dependence, but this is less a contributory factor than the intense psychological craving to perpetuate cocaine use. There is no specific way to treat dysfunctional cocaine use; instead the treatment plan must deal with the individual's specific situation. Except for a reduction of cocaine supply at the source, preventive measures are only feasible in the context of abstinence from all abusable drugs.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that alcohol and drug abuse and smoking are not only harmful for the consumer but will also, when taken by a pregnant woman, adversely affect her unborn child. The consequence of the abuse will result from a combination of specific toxic effects of abusing substances and a nonspecific effect from the often very unstable environment of an alcohol- or drug-dependent mother. Poor prenatal care is a common finding in alcohol and drug abuse leading to a high incidence of complications during pregnancy and delivery including premature labor and small-for-gestational-age babies. An increased perinatal mortality has been reported following all types of abuse including tobacco use, probably as a consequence of poor prenatal care as well as of a toxic effect on the fetus. Withdrawal symptoms after birth are most prominent in opiate addiction. The already intrauterinely damaged child will if it stays with its parents often continue to be exposed to several abverse environmental factors. However, symptoms such as mental retardation following alcohol abuse and hyperactivity and emotional disturbances following drug exposure during intrauterine life have also been found in children who have been taken from the parents and placed in foster homes immediately after birth. This means that children of abusing parents both in their custody and in foster home will have to be regarded as risk children that should be subjected to careful medical and psychological follow-up.",

Por otro lado, se dispone de evidencia suficiente acerca de la utilidad de los farmacos de primera linea para el abandono del tabaco (terapia sustitutiva con nicotina (TSN), Bupropion y Varenicline) en pacientes sanos, aunque la evidencia en psiquiatricos es mas limitada ya que se excluyeron de los estudios de comercializacion. Sin embargo, existen ciertas cautelas en su empleo en relacion a la posibilidad de un mayor riesgo de efectos neuropsiquiatricos graves en pacientes con y sin antecedentes psiquiatricos, circunstancia que no esta del todo aclarada en la literatura y que ha conllevado la inclusion de una alerta negra en las cajas de los dos medicamentos por la US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Aunque no existe contraindicacion para el empleo de estos farmacos en pacientes psiquiatricos, la monitorizacion estrecha deberia ser la norma. En base a lo anterior, se pretendio valorar la influencia de un programa de abandono del tabaco llevado a cabo en una unidad secundaria hospitalaria de deshabituacion tabaquica en el estado emocional de los pacientes mediante la medicion de los niveles de ansiedad/depresion a lo largo del mismo y las posibles diferencias en funcion de la presencia de antecedentes psiquiatricos. Para ello, se llevo a cabo un estudio de cohortes observacional, longitudinal y prospectivo, de la practica clinica habitual, con inclusion consecutiva de pacientes que acudieron a la Unidad de Deshabituacion Tabaquica del Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena para dejar de fumar entre marzo 2011 y octubre de 2012. Se incluyeron a todos los fumadores mayores de edad con un consumo acumulado > 10 paquetes/ano que aceptaron participar en el programa de abandono. Se excluyeron mujeres embarazadas o en periodo de lactancia, personas tratadas exclusivamente con parches de nicotina, que no comprendieran las indicaciones del cuestionario de ansiedad/depresion que se utilizo o que rechazaran participar en el estudio. Se llevo a cabo un programa de tratamiento farmacologico y de tipo cognitivo-conductual de 5 visitas (basal, a los 15 dias, primer, segundo y tercer mes). La pauta de tratamiento fue de 150 o 300 mg para Bupropion y de 1 mg/12 horas para Varenicline (previa titulacion) con una duracion de 8 semanas en los dos casos. El tratamiento se indico en todos los casos por el mismo neumologo que decidio la medicacion en funcion de las caracteristicas de cada paciente (antecedentes psiquiatricos, toma de medicacion concomitante, intentos previos, preferencias del paciente y costo). Se valoraron los sintomas de ansiedad y depresion mediante el empleo de la escala hospitalaria de ansiedad y depresion (HADS). Esta medicion se llevo a cabo tanto en la visita basal como 1er y 3er mes del seguimiento. De la misma manera se comprobo abstinencia mediante cooximetria y entrevista clinica. Todos los casos en los que no se pudo constatar la abstinencia (imposibilidad de contactar y o medir CO) fueron considerados como recaidas. Finalmente se incluyo un poblacion de 678 fumadores.\n Ver mas",

In the past year, she has been smoking marijuana three to five times per day, every day. Over the same year, her grades have declined and her relationship with her family has been strained in the context of increased cannabis use. Sertraline was started 4 months ago for depression and has been dosed at 200 mg daily for the past month. Her family notes improvement in sleep, concentration and mood with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The patient describes using marijuana, “because it's the only thing that has worked for my anxiety and made me not care about my depression.” She describes craving marijuana every day, especially when she smells marijuana on her clothes, smells marijuana on someone else, hears a song on the radio that she has enjoyed while high, or sees images of people smoking on TV. She doesn't intend to stop smoking altogether, but she doesn't want to feel like she needs to smoke every day. She has a history of occasional alcohol use (less than once a month) and occasional cigarettes (less than five per week).",

      "title": "Should I Stop Smoking",
      "abstract": "1. The Problem A few weeks ago I firmly decided to stop smoking. There are many good prudential reasons for this decision: the health risks, the economic cost, the regular morning-cough, the smell in my home, the troubles I have to go through in order to satisfy my addiction in an increasingly non-smoking society, the uneasy experience of being controlled by the habit and the accompanying loss of dignity. And then there are the health risks, of course. Slow death in lung cancer is hardly appealing and neither are the other various troubles that without doubt will hit me within the next twenty years. Add to these all the benevolent reasons which could be mobilised in support of the same thesis (dangers for people in my surroundings, the smell of my clothes and my body and other inconveniences to them caused by my disgusting habit), and the case for my obligation to stop smoking seems overwhelming, no matter what set of basic ethical norms and values is applied. There is one problem, however ? a problem I share with many other smokers: I have a weak character. I could, if I flexed the muscles of my will-power to their extreme, probably endure the problems of abstinence. However, in past attempts to 'kick the habit' I have never in fact done so and this is due to my strong tendency to yield to the temptation of the moment. But, since I in fact have such a lousy character, may I not as well yield immediately? Would the few weeks of pointless struggle really amount to anything more than sheer masochism: agony leading up to nothing? Might I not just as well have another cigarette immediately, thereby avoiding a non-negliable amount of pointless suffering? Intuitively, the correct answer to these questions seems to be affirmative. I should, therefore, have another cigarette. But since the same reasoning applies to any single cigarette I may smoke in the future, and since to stop smoking involves abstaining from each such cigarette, this line of reasoning seems to lead back to the negation of the thesis above: I should not stop smoking! This, then, is the problem I want to address: Can the just outlined paradox be resolved, and, if so, should I really try to stop smoking in light of the facts about my weak character? It is a real problem, I should know, because the story I have told is about myself and it is true. But how should we reflect on it? I will approach it from two different viewpoints: first, from the perspective of normative ethics and, secondly, from the perspective of decision theory. My conclusion will be somewhat perplexing: on the one hand, although partly faulty, the reasoning sketched above is mostly correct, but, on the other, people like me (people with a weak character, that is) should in general avoid to think along such (albeit correct) lines.",

Solitary abuse of one single drug, either hashish or opium, is the common feature of drug abuse in Afghanistan. 3. Abuse of other patent drugs as well as multiple drug abuse by the same individual, increasingly common elsewhere, is quite rare. 4. Self-treatment is a major cause of drug abuse in Afghanistan while escape from boredom and lack of work and motivation is another. 5. Hashish as well as opium is commonly abused by people of a low socioeconomical standard. 6. Alcohol, a more recent introduction by the upper class, is becoming popular among city dwellers with major risks involved for the future. 7. Drug abuse in Afghanistan has so far not created problems comparable to those in the West, although there is no guarantee that in future it will not do so. Coercive measures aimed at depriving an individual of his drug of choice may involve the greater risk of drug substitution which will then be an even more difficult problem to manage. 8. Factors involved in prevention as well as cure of the drug-dependent population in Afghanistan have been discussed.",

      "title": "A fresh look at tobacco harm reduction: the case for the electronic cigarette",
      "abstract": "Smokers of any age can reap substantial health benefits by quitting. In fact, no other single public health effort is likely to achieve a benefit comparable to large-scale smoking cessation. Surveys document that most smokers would like to quit, and many have made repeated efforts to do so. However, conventional smoking cessation approaches require nicotine addicted smokers to abstain from tobacco and nicotine entirely. Many smokers are unable – or at least unwilling – to achieve this goal, and so they continue smoking in the face of impending adverse health consequences. In effect, the status quo in smoking cessation presents smokers with just two unpleasant alternatives: quit or suffer the harmful effects of continuing smoking. But, there is a third choice for smokers: tobacco harm reduction. It involves the use of alternative sources of nicotine, including modern smokeless tobacco products like snus and the electronic cigarette (E-cig), or even pharmaceutical nicotine products, as a replacement for smoking. E-cigs might be the most promising product for tobacco harm reduction to date, because, besides delivering nicotine vapour without the combustion products that are responsible for nearly all of smoking's damaging effect, they also replace some of the rituals associated with smoking behaviour. Thus it is likely that smokers who switch to E-cigs will achieve large health gains. The focus of this article is on the health effects of using an E-cig, with consideration given to the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of this product as a long-term substitute for smoking.",

      "title": "Health aspects of cannabis: revisited",
      "abstract": "Literature pertaining to the effects of cannabis use and health which has been published during the past 11 years has been reviewed. Many older concerns about adverse effects on health (chromosomal damage, 'cannabinol psychosis', endocrine abnormalities, cardiac events, impaired immunity) no longer seem to elicit much interest. Continuing concerns about the adverse cognitive effects of chronic use indicate that these can be demonstrated by proper testing; some studies suggest that they may be long-lasting. Although cannabis does not produce a specific psychosis, the possibility exists that it may exacerbate schizophrenia in persons predisposed to that disorder. However, evidence from retrospective surveys must always be questioned. Tolerance and dependence have occurred in man, confirming previous findings in many other species. Addiction tends to be mild and is probably less severe than with other social drugs. Driving under the influence of cannabis is impaired acutely; how long such impairments last is still unknown. More exacting tasks, such as flying an airplane, may be impaired for as long as 24 hours. While there is no doubt that marijuana smoke contains carcinogens, an increase in cancer among users has thus far been anecdotal. Because of the long latent period between cancer induction and initiation of cigarette smoking, the full story is yet to be told. Marijuana use during pregnancy is not advised although the consequences are usually not greater than those of smoking cigarettes, and far less than those from alcohol use. Whether smoked marijuana should become a therapeutic agent requires a cost-benefit analysis of the potential benefits versus the adverse effects of such use as we now know them.",

      "abstract": "º III » Le terme « tabagisme », issu du vocabulaire médical, qualifie l'intoxication aiguë ou chronique par des quantités abusives de tabac, bien que depuis longtemps il soit à tort utilisé pour désigner la simple consommation de ce dernier.Le tabagisme dit « actif » est, par opposition au tabagisme passif, l'inhalation volontaire de la fumée de tabac contenue dans une cigarette, un cigare ou une pipe ainsi que la consommation des formes de tabac non fumées.Le tabagisme passif est quant à lui l'inhalation involontaire de la fumée dégagée par la cigarette ou le cigare laissé par exemple dans le cendrier, ou encore exhalé par un ou plusieurs fumeurs.Le tabac est un facteur de risque important dans l'apparition des maladies cardiovasculaires, pulmonaires et des cancers, les populations de fumeurs présentant au même âge une morbi-mortalité plus élevée que les non-fumeurs.Fumer altère le fonctionnement et/ou l'intégrité de tous les organes du corps humain et le sevrage tabagique, quel que soit l'âge auquel il est initié, conduit rapidement à une amélioration de l'état de santé de l'individu et à une réduction significative des risques liés au tabagisme.Malgré de nombreuses hausses du prix du tabac décidées par les gouvernements successifs, fumer ne coûte pas encore assez cher pour décourager la plupart des consommateurs.Bien que le « budget cigarettes » puisse être parfois conséquent, il ne ruine pas comme cela peut être le cas lors de la consommation d'autres drogues moins accessibles.Il s'agit donc d'une addiction qui reste abordable, et ce, même chez les plus jeunes.Le tabagisme est d'ailleurs répandu dans toutes les classes sociales, surtout les plus modestes.Enfin, il semble indispensable de rappeler que le tabac est actuellement parfaitement légal malgré les effets néfastes qui lui sont attribués et qu'il constitue même une source de revenus non négligeable pour l'État.Contrairement à d'autres addictions comme l'alcoolisme, le tabac n'entraîne ni déchéance intellectuelle, ni ivresse, et par conséquent ne perturbe pas le fonctionnement familial ou socioprofessionnel.Le regard social sur le tabac est donc très différent de celui que l'on a sur l'alcool ou d'autres drogues.En effet, le tabagisme est toléré, accepté, voire même par certains, encouragé.Ces éléments font la particularité de cette drogue et augmentent son danger.Le tabac tue en silence et c'est particulièrement l'initiale discrétion et la latence de ses effets qui le rendent dangereux.Nous savons pertinemment que les maladies qui affectent le plus une",

Even when nonfatal, overdoses have a high potential for lasting health consequences. In the United States, the majority of drug overdose deaths are classified as unintentional/accidental. Drug overdoses can involve a variety of substances, ranging from prescription or over-the-counter medications to illicitly-manufactured drugs, and many overdoses involve multiple substances. In the United States, opioids, especially synthetic opioids such as illicitly-manufactured fentanyl, are most commonly involved in overdose deaths, followed by stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine. Drug overdoses disproportionately impact populations experiencing social and/or economic marginalization, and racial disparities in drug overdose are growing in the United States. Overall, drug overdose represents a topic of relevance for social workers engaged in research, policy, clinical, or community practice alike, across medical, behavioral health, legal, social service, educational, and child welfare systems.",

TreatmentDespite the availability of effective treatments, few people with bulimia nervosa seek help.One study found that only 1 in 10 people with the condition are in treatment. 1 Treatments that are likely to workAntidepressants Antidepressants can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.There is not enough evidence on how long the benefits last or for comparing the effects of different classes of antidepressants.Antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy are equally effective for bulimia nervosa, though dropout rates are higher with antidepressants, probably due to their side effects.For information on drug doses, see www.besttreatments.org/bulimianervosa. Cognitive behaviour therapyAs with antidepressants, cognitive behaviour therapy can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.It may be preferable to medication in patients who are sensitive to, or wish to avoid, side effects of medication.Cognitive behaviour therapy and other psychological treatments seem to be equally good at treating binge eating, although cognitive behaviour therapy is better at improving depression scores.There is some evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy has long term benefits in treating bulimia, but there is insufficient evidence about patients' characteristics that predict response.",

      "abstract": "Khat chewing in the United Kingdom, has been largely confined to specific ethnocultural groups such as the Somali and the Yemeni community. In Europe, Khatchewing has also spread among members of the Somali community in Rome. The chewing of Khat is the most common method of use but it can also be smoked and taken as tea. The effects include euphoria, increased alertness, excitement with an improved ability to communicate etc. Various physical and psychological problems have been reported among Khat users. Strong associations have been found between Khat use and histories of anorexia, constipation, insomnia, headaches and respiratory problems. Depression and feelings of anxiety seemed to be less common although various forms of psychosis have been associated with Khat among migrant populations such as the Somali population. The prevalence of tobacco smoking is high among the Khat chewers in the London's study. Although illegal drugs are relatively uncommon among Khat chewers, cannabis use has been reported. It is considered that there are no physical symptoms or withdrawal of Khat or tolerance in contrast to the marked tolerance observed with amphetamine misuse. Despite the widespread of Khat use, few individuals appear to request help with their Khat use. It is clear that the pattern and perceptions of Khat use are changing among the community of Khat chewers.",

      "title": "Alcoholic abstinence in elderly subjects with misuse of alcohol",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder does not disappear with aging, neither the associated induced-suffering. While the prevalence of alcohol use disorder still remains around 10% in the subjects over 65 year old age, and daily encountered by hospital or nursing-home caregivers. Alcohol misuse is often overlooked in elderly people, which then obtain lesser care than younger adults although the care prognosis remains as good as or better than before the age of 65, alcoholic abstinence gets always a place among care offers to elders suffering of alcohol use disorders and dependence. However abstinence is a complex notion gathering various representations or meanings, and induces necessary psychological changes. Alcoholic abstinence seems thus to be feared by families or caregivers, because of lack of knowledge about the addictive dimension of the disorder. On behalf of ultimate freedom, and allowing a last pleasure, alcohol use disorders and its associated suffering can be neglected because abstinence is considered as aggressive and harmful. However, modalities of reduction of alcohol consumption as well as access control or regulated supply of alcoholic beverages, keep having a place in graduate care offers. Beyond the choice of decreasing or suppress drinking alcohol beverages, which only are terms or conditions of improvement, the main point remains the improvement of well-fare, quality of life and elders' health.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: O uso de alcool entre adolescentes e, naturalmente, um tema controverso no meio social e academico brasileiro. Ao mesmo tempo em que a lei brasileira define como proibida a venda de bebidas alcoolicas para menores de 18 anos, e pratica comum o consumo de alcool pelos jovens, seja no ambiente domiciliar, em festividades, ou mesmo em ambientes publicos. Aqueles que sao coniventes com esse comportamento devem se conscientizar de que as consequencias negativas ligadas ao uso do alcool podem ter grande impacto na vida desses adolescentes, como um pior rendimento nos estudos, problemas sociais, pratica de sexo sem protecao e/ou sem consentimento, maior risco de suicidio ou homicidio, e acidentes relacionados ao consumo. Os adolescentes do sexo masculinos mais velhos, que vivem em areas urbanas, foram os mais propensos a apresentar doencas relacionadas ao alcool e ao fumo.  Alem disso, as principais razoes para o uso pesado/frequente de alcool sao o prazer, diversao e ansiedade. Quanto a depressao, relata-se que quase um terco dos participantes informou ter sofrido desse mal, alem de serem duas vezes mais propensos a ter transtornos relacionados ao uso do alcool. A sociedade como um todo adota atitudes paradoxais frente ao tema: por um lado condena o abuso de alcool pelos jovens, mas e tipicamente permissiva ao estimulo do consumo por meio da propaganda. Objetivo: Este estudo objetivou descrever a prevalencia do consumo de alcool entre adolescentes, bem como ressaltar os impactos sociais do entre jovens e evidenciar os efeitos toxicos do mesmo. Metodologia: Atraves de um levantamento de revisao sistematica bibliografica foram pesquisados os bancos de dados Google Academico e Scielo sendo utilizados os termos chaves: alcoolismo na adolescencia,alcool e jovens. Foram utilizados como limites artigos publicados desde o ano 2010 e no idioma portugues. A busca bibliografica resultou em cinco artigos que representaram o tema. Resultados : A populacao de adolescentes dos estudos esteve compreendia com idades entre 10-20 anos de idade. A acao do alcool no organismo inclui a degeneracao das celulas cerebrais, o aumento da pressao arterial e dos batimentos cardiacos, alem do aparecimento de ulceras e cirrose como condicoes de toxicidade em longo prazo. Desta forma entende-se pertinente o estudo da epidemiologia do uso do alcool por adolescentes, desvendando sua influencia sobre a saude dos jovens, o impacto emocional e social deste vicio e as formas de consumo nos dias atuais, bem como os fatores da sociedade contemporânea que influenciam este uso. C onclusao: O consumo de alcool por adolescentes ainda tem elementos controversos para sua compreensao. Apesar de trazer claras consequencias orgânicas, comportamentais e na estrutura de desenvolvimento da personalidade do jovem o uso do alcool por adolescentes e uma realidade em distintos contextos sociais. Alem da necessidade de se preencher a atual lacuna no setor da saude e bem-estar social para adolescentes, sao necessarias acoes voltadas para o ambiente familiar e potenciais fatores de protecao e de risco que envolve os habitos dos pais.",

      "abstract": "Cuando se desea examinar y evaluar las politicas de drogas, es util distinguir entre problemas de drogas primarios y secundarios (L. Hulsman y H. Van Ransbeek, 1983). Problemas de drogas primarios son los relacionados con las drogas que se producen con independencia de la politica de drogas que se siga en el sector colectivo; problemas de drogas secundarios son aquellos que estan relacionados especificamente con una determinada politica de drogas y que no ocurririan de esta manera si se adoptara una politica de drogas diferente. Tomemos algunos ejemplos de problemas primarios en materia de drogas. Un consumidor de drogas puede sufrir danos en su salud fisica: cirrosis, como consecuencia del alcohol, o una enfermedad pulmonar, como consecuencia de fumar cigarrillos regularmente. El dano puede tambien referirse a su salud mental: algunas sicosis se manifiestan despues del consumo de alcohol o de LSD. La dependencia fisica o sicologica puede convertirse en una carga. El consumo de droga puede convertirse en el punto central de la vida, impidiendo el desarrollo personal. Todos estos problemas que afectan al consumidor de drogas, afectan tambien a menudo a su medio inmediato: su familia, sus amigos y sus colegas en el lugar de trabajo. El consumo de drogas puede tambien presentar problemas primarios para un mas amplio medio circundante del consumidor. Algunas personas son propensas a volverse violentas despues del consumo excesivo de alcohol. La combinacion de consumo de alcohol con la conduccion de vehiculos motorizados presenta riesgos especiales para los otros usuarios de la carretera. Ninguno de estos problemas primarios de las drogas esta especificamente ligado al consumo de heroina, cocaina u otras drogas ilegales. El alcohol, el tabaco y las drogas medicinales pueden producir problemas de esta naturaleza (Plant. 1981). Los problemas secundarios de drogas estan especificamente relacionados con las drogas ilegales. Veamos mas de cerca algunos de estos problemas secundarios de drogas. Quiero hacer una distincion entre: 1) problemas secundarios para el consumidor; 2) problemas secundarios para el medio ambiente del consumidor; 3) problemas secundarios para la justicia criminal; y 4) problemas secundarios para el sistema medico-social. Problemas secundarios para el consumidor. Generalmente la prohibicion no hace que las drogas",

      "title": "Oral Nicotine Self-Administration in Rodents",
      "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is a complex process that begins with self-administration. Consequently, this process has been studied extensively using animal models. A person is usually not called \"smoker\" if s/he has smoked for a week or a month in a lifetime; in general, a smoker has been smoking for many years. Furthermore, a smoker has free access to cigarettes and can smoke whenever she/he wants, provided there are no social/legal restraints. Subsequently, in an animal model of tobacco addiction, it will be desirable to expose the animal to free access nicotine for 24 hours/day for many weeks, starting at different stages of development. Oral nicotine self-administration studies in rodents present some important advantages and mimic human smoking nicely. For example, animals are not food deprived, are exposed to nicotine choice for up to 24 hours a day for extended periods, environmental cues and learning does not interfere with self-administration of nicotine. Oral alcohol selfadministration has been used in rodents for over five decades and has contributed significantly to the understanding of alcohol addiction. We provide a review of literature and compare oral alcohol and nicotine intake in rodents. Methodological issues, post ingestional and systemic effects, discrimination and the important influences of taste, genetic vulnerability, sex and age on intake are discussed. The review ends with recommendations for future research on oral self-administration of nicotine.",

The data on other factors such as use of mobile phone and stress on reproductive health are inadequate and need detailed study.

The health effects reducing chronic high, moderate or low smoking while maintaining some use versus quitting. This document provides some answers to the following questions: Q1. Is chronic low tobacco smoking (loose leaf tobacco, cigarettes) associated with: a) an accrued mortality and morbidity versus no smoking; b) a lesser risk of mortality and morbidity versus chronic moderate or high consumption? Q2.1. Is decreased chronic consumption associated with reduced mortality of morbidity versus stable consumption? Q2.2. Is the mortality and morbidity risk associated with reduced consumption similar to that of quitting? This literature review, based on original articles from powerful cohort studies with long follow-up periods, shows the following results: Q1a. Even low chronic consumption (0 15 cpd) may benefit from a slight risk reduction if they decrease consumption, probably due to an excessive risk from the outset. However, there is insufficient proof to say whether the reduced incidence of lung cancer is associated with reduced rates of all- cause mortality.",

In laboratory experiments, mice pre-exposed with nicotine via cigarette or vape demonstrated addictive behaviors around THC; however, mice pre-exposed with normal air did not demonstrate these addictive behaviors [2]. Nicotine use can also increase the rewarding feeling derived from using other mind-altering drugs; therefore, vaping itself may be a dangerous gateway that increases the propensity for other types of substance use and addiction [3].",

Regular cannabis smoking can lead to respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest Such symptoms are similar to those induced by cigarette smoking but can occur (independently of cigarette smoking) even after a relatively short duration of cannabis use (Taylor et al. 2000).",

Both the type of product and the general health of the population determine the outcome. All tobacco products contain carcinogenic substances and substantial quantities of nicotine. Nicotine has, apart from its psychoactive properties, abundant vasoregulatory effects through the mediation of cholinergic as well as adrenergic stimuli. Studies of the effects of snuff or snus use in developed countries have shown a moderate risk for cancer, cardiovascular mortality and metabolic diseases, such as type II diabetes. Also, snus use during pregnancy has been found to be a health risk for the newborn baby. The evidence, therefore, suggests that although snuff and snus are less hazardous than smoked tobacco, the most deadly of all consumer products, there is indeed reason to be cautious about the use of smokeless tobacco.",

A mes, els pacients amb comorbiditat psiquiatrica fumen mes quantitat de tabac i tenen mes dependencia a la nicotina que la poblacio general. Aquest fet es tradueix amb un major cost per la salut i major cost economic. Tot i que en els darrers anys s’ha reduit la prevalenca de fumadors en els paisos mes desenvolupats, no s’ha observat aquesta reduccio en la poblacio psiquiatrica. Un dels factors clau pot ser l’ajornament sine die de l’abordatge del tabaquisme dels pacients amb psicopatologia per por a descompensacions psiquiatriques o a recaigudes en consum d’ altres toxics, encara que vulguin deixar de fumar. Aquest es un fet frequent en pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol. D’altra banda, tot i que els pacients amb psicopatologia poden deixar de fumar, sovint l’exit dels tractaments es menor. Aixi, no queda clar quin es el paper que juguen els antecedents de depressio major i la simptomatologia depressiva present a l’ inici del tractament per abandonar el tabac. Tampoc es coneix si hi ha trets de la personalitat, segons el model de personalitat de Zuckerman, que dificultin l’abstinencia. Els objectius son: 1. Analitzar quin es el millor moment per a iniciar un tractament del tabaquisme en pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol; el mateix moment que inicien tractament per a l’alcohol o sis mesos despres. 2. Avaluar l’ impacte dels antecedents de depressio major i de la simptomatologia depressiva, en l’abstinencia tabaquica. 3. Mesurar quins trets de personalitat, segons el model de Zuckerman, s’associen a major risc de dependencia nicotinica, major consum i risc de recaiguda. Les dades d’aquesta tesi venen de dos estudis diferents: el primer amb poblacio amb dependencia de l’alcohol i el segon amb poblacio general. En el primer estudi, un grup de pacients rep tractament estandard per l’alcohol i per deixar de fumar simultaniament o en diferit, primer per l’alcohol i sis mesos mes tard pel tabac. En el segon estudi, s’ avalua l’ impacte dels antecedents de depressio major, simptomatologia depressiva i trets de personalitat en els resultats d’una intervencio en tabaquisme. En tots els casos, la intervencio per deixar de fumar combina tractament cognitiu-conductual i farmacoterapia. Els resultats indiquen que els pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol poden deixar de fumar i beure a la vegada sense que augmenti el risc de recaiguda en l’ alcohol, tampoc afecta a l’ adherencia, ni hi ha diferencies en la taxa d’ abstinencia del consum de tabac, comparat amb fer tractament per l’alcohol i despres pel tabac. D’altra banda, els antecedents de depressio major no disminueixen la probabilitat d’abstinencia de consum tabac. En canvi, la simptomatologia depressiva a l’ inici del tractament per deixar de fumar, si minva la probabilitat d’abstinencia. Per ultim, s’evidencia l’existencia de trets de personalitat diferencials segons el sexe, que impliquen major risc de dependencia i recaiguda. En homes, un baix nivell de sociabilitat es relaciona amb major nivells de dependencia, mentre que no es troben trets relacionats amb major dependencia en dones. Majors nivells d’impulsivitat i sociabilitat es relacionen amb major risc de recaiguda en homes i dones, respectivament. Aquesta tesi aporta dades a favor de la rellevancia d’identificar aspectes psicopatologics i de personalitat en pacients que inicien tractament per a la deshabituacio tabaquica. La identificacio de variables associades amb la recaiguda en el consum de tabac hauria de permetre orientar esforcos a minimitzar el seu efecte i millorar els resultats de les intervencions en tabaquisme.",

La que genera el tabaquismo no es sencilla, comprende multiples factores, que provocan en el individuo una severa afectacion que conlleva su perpetuacion en el consumo. Asi el tabaco provoca fundamentalmente dos tipos de dependencia: fisica o farmacologica y psicologica o psicocomportamental. No obstante, a las mismas se debe anadir el `habito o automatismo'; adquirido tras anos de consumo diario de mas de 20 cigarrillos de promedio. Por otro lado, el fumador inveterado asocia el consumo de tabaco con gran cantidad de estimulos, es el componente manual-oral del cigarrillo, al que ademas hay que sumar la dependencia social que genera el pitillo al constituir en muchas ocasiones el intermediario para comenzar una entrevista o mantener un conversacion. Por todo ello, el tratamiento del tabaquismo es un tema complejo que requiere ser abordado de una forma multifactorial. Considerandolo no unicamente como una adiccion fisica que requiere un tratamiento farmacologico, sino que ademas debe contemplar la realizacion de un tratamiento psicologico, ya sea individual o de grupo, que ayude al paciente a pasar de ser fumador a exfumador, aprendiendo a vivir sin tabaco. En este articulo hacemos una revision de las distintas terapias psicologicas utilizadas en la deshabituacion tabaquica.",

Quiza cualquiera puede volverse adicto si es capaz de beber lo suficiente durante un periodo largo. Debido a que el adolescente, cuya vida se desenvuelve en medio de profundos cambios bio-psicosociales, suele explorar y experimentar, y a veces se vera involucrado en conductas de alto riesgo. La interrelacion entre las conductas de alto riesgo es dramatica; por ejemplo, ha sido bien establecido que hay una relacion entre los accidentes de transito y el uso de alcohol; la contribucion del alcohol a la mortalidad general no se limita al transito automotor, sino que abarca un porcentaje sustancial de muertos por incendios y ahogados. Asimismo, hay una clara correlacion entre fumar y el uso de alcohol y marihuana y la iniciacion precoz de relaciones sexuales. Desde el punto de vista clinico, es importante diferenciar el uso ocasional o experimental, de su consumo habitual o sostenido. Es esta ultima situacion la que debe preocupar al equipo interdisciplinario, especialmente si se acompana de disminucion en el rendimiento escolar o de problemas de relaciones interpersonales de comienzo reciente. La busqueda de causas desencadenantes debe incluir la exploracion del ambiente familiar (un numero importante de Direccion para correspondencia: Dr. Antonio Salas Riczker, Catedra de Farmacologia, Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Iquique y Sodiro s/n, Telf. 2528690, 2528810, Quito, Ecuador. casos se relaciona con dificultades del adolescente o el joven con sus padres, de los progenitores entre si o de alguna crisis familiar cronica); en un numero menor, pero siempre significativo, es posible detectar sicopatologia individual, como desordenes afectivos o cuadros sicoticos.

      "abstract": "Alcohol and tobacco consumption are correlated-smokers consume more alcohol than do nonsmokers and alcohol consumers smoke more than do teetotalers. In addition, heavy drinking tends to be associated with heavy smoking. A large majority of alcoholics, who by definition are heavy drinkers, smoke. A number of studies examining the effects of ethanol pretreatment or availability on tobacco consumption have demonstrated that ethanol potentiates tobacco consumption. Whether smoking potentiates alcohol consumption is not known. Possible mechanisms underlying the alcohol/tobacco association, including cross-tolerance between the two drugs, are discussed. Tobacco appears to counteract the deleterious effects of alcohol on some measures of performance. The association between alcohol and tobacco consumption may have some relevance regarding the issue of relapse to either one of the drugs. Finally, combined use of alcohol and tobacco presents greater risk of certain diseases than the sum of the excess risks of alcohol and tobacco considered individually.",

They may at some point have tried to stop using and, after somewhat longer or shorter periods of abstinence, have started using again. Not every drug user develops an addiction: addicts’ lives revolve around compulsive drug-seeking and use; they lose control over their own decision-making and end up relapsing. This occurs because addiction is a brain disease that can modify its structure and functioning, affecting the areas of the brain responsible for controlling our behaviour. Addiction is a public health problem affecting a high percentage of the population and leads to health, family, and work-related problems.",

      "abstract": "Het recreatieve gebruik van lachgas heeft de laatste jaren een grote vlucht genomen. Hoewel incidenteel lachgasgebruik nauwelijks gezondheidsschade geeft, kan langdurig of excessief lachgasgebruik tot neurologische schade leiden. Het viel Amsterdamse zorgcentra en behandelaren op dat met name jonge Marokkaanse en Turkse Nederlanders in stadsdeel Amsterdam Nieuw-West zich meldden met neurologische symptomen, waaronder ernstige verlammingsverschijnselen na problematisch lachgasgebruik. Middels interviews met dertien jonge Marokkaans-Nederlandse gebruikers (19-28 jaar) worden de determinanten van hun problematisch lachgasgebruik belicht, inclusief de relatief lage medisch-psychische zorgvraag bij deze groep gebruikers. Van hen waren zeven jongeren (poly-)klinisch in behandeling voor hun problematische gebruik. De overige zes jongeren waren niet in behandeling, maar gebruikten wel ten minste elke week lachgas. Uit de interviews blijkt dat lachgas wordt gebruikt uit verveling en om psychosociale stress en negatieve gedachten te onderdrukken. Lachgas lijkt een panacee dat verlichting biedt. Andere motieven zijn depressie, discriminatie en conflicten met vrienden of ouders. Door de (taboe)cultuur rond middelengebruik, het wantrouwen, schaamte en machocultuur bij deze groep gebruikers bereikt de hulpverlening pas laat de Marokkaans-Nederlandse problematische lachgasgebruiker. De conclusie is dat het aanbeveling verdient om influencers in te zetten bij campagnes, gericht op de risico’s en behandeling van fors lachgasgebruik. Ook het ‘jongerenwerk’ kan een belangrijke rol spelen in het motiveren van sociaal geisoleerde gebruikers om medisch-psychische hulp te zoeken.",

Some of these substances, such as spruce gum and chewing gum or chicle are chewed for their pleasant taste and are perfectly harmless. On the other hand, many of the materials that are chewed or smoked possess constituents, which stimulate or depress the central nervous system. Stimulants are chemical agents or drugs which invigorate or increase the functional activity of the body. Included in this category are caffeine beverages, tobacco, betel and coca, to mention a few.They act as mild stimulants producing no effect, whatsoever, on the consciousness of the user. The combustion products of tobacco formed during smoking, however, are more harmful and may cause diseases of the respiratory tract, including possibly lung cancer. Like food and drink, stimulants have now become part of man's daily needs. It is difficult to imagine the world today without caffeine beverages, such as coffee, tea and cocoa, tobacco, betel and cola or beer and wine.",

The question raised is thus: will an adolescent experimenter be a non smoker, an experimenter for ever, a regular smoker, light or heavy? This short review shows that there are numerous factors from genetics, to familial environment not limited to tobacco issues, smoking situation at school as well as school performances of the student, and also individual psychological characteristics. The experimenter is a very good target for smoking cessation actions and should deserve particular attention from preventive medicine and, thus, from school medicine, before he becomes a regular smoker, who will be more resistant to smoking cessation programs.",

      "title": "THE PSYCHODYNAMICS OF THE \"DRY DRUNK\"",
      "abstract": "Our study of the responses of the 52 respondents to the questionnaire on the dry drunk leads us to the following conclusions: 1. The dry drunk is experienced by the majority of alcoholics who have maintained sobriety over a long period. 2. The occupation of an alcoholic has no statistical significance in maintaining sobriety. 3. A number of alcoholics will drink from 10 to 20 years before they begin to maintain sobriety. 4. Dry drunks generally occur within the first year of sobriety ( occasionally during the early months). 5. This symptom occurs irregularly and with diminishing intensity as the period of sobriety lengthens. 6. The dry drunk is characterized by a feeling of deep depression and frustration and by indecision regarding taking a drink. 7. \"Inner life\" is largely responsible for precipitating a dry drunk. 8. The dry drunk often is preceded by the same feelings. 9. The principal feelings after a dry drunk are relief and thankfulness at not drinking during this period of craving. 10. Drugs are not used to combat the moods and feelings of a dry drunk nor to produce similar feelings. 11. Alcoholics are irritable, restless, and impatient during a dry drunk. 12. After a dry drunk one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior return to normal. 13. A. A. members are the persons most helpful during a dry drunk while spouses, other members of the family, and former drinking companions are the least helpful. 14. Dry drunks may be prevented by contacts with A. A. and efforts to keep the mind off the drinking problem. 15. Dry drunks are generally related to one's mood swings 16. The financial status generally improves when sobriety is maintained over an extended period. 17. The dry drunks described by our respondents have a number of the same characteristics as the \" late withdrawal symptoms\" described by Wellman. We feel that this study has been useful in clarifying our thinking on the dry drunk, in indicating sources of help for persons who are experiencing or may suffer dry drunks, and in pointing out areas for further study. We are impressed with the thoughtful, painstaking way in which the questionnaires were answered and with the willingness of the respondents to elaborate in detail on their experiences.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine, a potent stimulant found in tobacco products, has significant effects on oral health and overall well-being. Saliva samples showing the presence of nicotine can be very helpful as evidence in a variety of situations. Salivary nicotine levels can reveal smoking habits. It offers proof of whether a person has recently used tobacco goods. Saliva testing can be used, for instance, to support or contradict smoking behaviours in court cases involving custody disputes, child endangerment, or employment regulations. Saliva nicotine testing can be used in criminal investigations to determine a suspect's smoking history. If saliva includes nicotine traces, it can be used to identify the person to a place or occasion, particularly at the crime scene which may reveal discarded cigarette butts or other tobacco-related evidence. Also, exposure to nicotine impacts general health. Saliva tests can reveal whether or not a person uses tobacco, which is important information for determining health risks. For example, nicotine testing can be used by medical practitioners to assess a patient's willingness to stop smoking or to track their progress while participating in smoking cessation programmes. Moreover, some insurance providers take nicotine usage into account when setting insurance premiums or providing coverage. Saliva test results can impact judgments about disability claims, health insurance, and life insurance. However, it's crucial to properly interpret the findings of nicotine tests. Due to the variety of benefits associated with the identification of salivary nicotine, this article aims to develop an affordable technique that can facilitate the in-situ, real-time detection of nicotine in saliva samples.",

      "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY * Long busy-season hours give CPA's so little time for exercise or regular meals that stress can build. This can weaken a person's immune system and make him or her more prone to illness. The overload also can diminish employee performance and lead to low morale, absenteeism and high turnover among staff members. * CPAs CAN TAKE SIMPLE STEPS--both at home and at work--to develop healthful habits that mitigate stress, sustain energy and make staying fit throughout busy season an attainable goal. * TO SUPPORT STAMINA AND CONCENTRATION, a CPA with a heavy workload needs to eat when his or her body signals hunger and keep healthful, high-protein snacks in the office. * A CPA WHO CAN'T GET TO A GYM or hasn't used one can relieve stress by doing small amounts of exercise such as 10 minutes at home in the morning and another 10 minutes after work. Simple, accessible activities such as a brisk walk, a bike ride or boxing/dance moves to upbeat music will work. * IN THE OFFICE, CPAs CAN USE SHORT BREAKS for stretches, push-ups, sit-ups, toe touches and other exercises that don't require equipment. They also can take the stairs instead of the elevator or walk to lunch or to a client meeting. * A PROFESSIONAL TRAINER CAN PUT TOGETHER an exercise plan to help CPAs get the most out of their time and keep workouts safe and balanced. Once learned, routines can be done at work or at home. Long hours, especially from January to April, take their toll on CPAs. Busy season leaves so little time for exercise or regular, balanced meals that what we eat when we get a break may make us more lethargic than energetic. On top of that, the nonstop deadline pressure triggers stress, affecting everyone in the firm--from partners to staff--mentally, emotionally and physically. Such stress can lead to biochemical imbalances that weaken our immune systems, make us more prone to illness and confer a hidden--and high--cost of working in our profession. In the office environment, it contributes to diminished employee performance, low morale, conflicts, absenteeism and high turnover. Staying fit throughout busy season is attainable for everyone, however. Here are some helpful strategies I learned during my six years in the trenches at KPMG LLP. FUEL FOR THOUGHT Some things CPAs can do to mitigate stress are easier than you might think. For example, eating the right foods (particularly those high in protein) strengthens your immune system, lowers blood pressure and stabilizes your energy levels. To develop good nutritional habits that support stamina and concentration, try to * Eat when you're hungry. This may seem obvious, but it isn't common practice. Many busy people go to work in the morning without breakfast or work through lunch because they believe they don't have time for a meal. Eating when you're hungry--not starved--helps to lessen stress and control weight gain. * Keep it simple. Breakfast and lunch don't have to be elaborate to maintain energy. The proteins and carbohydrates in protein bars, fruit, cheese, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs or peanut butter on toast are sufficient. Foods that are complete proteins, such as nuts, meat or eggs, have all the amino acids your body needs to construct new proteins. Studies say they tend to stave off hunger longer. * Don't wait too long between meals. This leads to unpleasant hunger, characterized by headaches, fatigue, lack of concentration and irritability. If you wait until you feel starved, you'll overeat at the next meal. Eat at regular intervals. Set an alarm or use a kitchen timer to signal when it's time for a food break if you're likely to become immersed in your work. * Stop eating before you feel stuffed. Learn to recognize when you're no longer truly hungry. The stomach is about the size of a large baked potato, so a body has met its needs long before a stretched feeling in the stomach signals stop. …",

      "title": "Social and Psychological Factors Underlying Inhalant Abuse",
      "abstract": "There are three distinct types of inhalant users: young inhalant users, adolescent polydrug users, and inhalant-dependent adults. Young inhalant users have a modal age of 12 to 13. They use inhalants and may also use alcohol and marijuana. They are likely to have more emotional problems than nondrug users or young marijuana users. These problems, particularly when they involve feelings of anger and alienation, increase the chances that they will identify with other youth who have similar feelings. When this happens, young people form peer clusters; they find a best friend or form a small gang that has a high potential for getting involved with drugs. Most of these peer clusters use inhalants only a few times a month, although some may become obsessed with inhalant use to the exclusion of nearly all other activities. The data showing that young inhalant users have more emotional problems than either nondrug users or young marijuana users suggest that treatment should involve therapy as well as drug avoidance approaches. Every youth caught using inhalants, however, should not automatically be sent for therapy. Sometimes a youth caught using a drug is not really drug involved and overreaction can be damaging. In addition, the emotional problems of all young inhalant users are not identical. A higher average level of emotional problems only means that some of the young inhalant users have those problems, not all of them. Older adolescents, including those who used inhalants earlier, are not likely to use inhalants. Since young inhalant users seem to be troubled youth, have shown an early penchant for drug use, and have drug-using associates, it seem unlikely that they quit using drugs. They probably move on to other drugs, leaving inhalants behind. The older adolescents who do use inhalants are adolescent polydrug users, with a modal age of around 15 to 16. They take many different drugs, and some of them use inhalants as well. The adolescents who use inhalants are probably using a wider range of drugs than other adolescents and are probably getting high more often. Furthermore, they are likely to be more deviant and may be involved in more aggression and more crime. Inhalant-dependent adults usually have a long history of alcohol and other drug involvement. At some point, inhalants have become their preferred drug. By that time, they are usually in their midtwenties to early thirties. They have serious problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "BAB 1PENDAHULUANA.Latar BelakangNarkoba merupakan singkatan dari Narkotika, Psikotropika dan zat adiktif lainnya BNN (2006). Narkoba pada awalnya digunakan untuk keperluan medis, pemakaiannya akan menjadi aman dan efektif apabila digunakan pada dosis tertentu, bentuk – bentuk tertentu dan juga pada waktu yang tepat. Narkoba menjadi disalahgunakan apabila digunakan untuk tujuan non medis seperti: mabuk, menurunkan berat badan dan menambah massa otot Anonymous (2006). Menurut Joewana dan Martono (2006) dibalik dampak negatifnya, penggunaan narkoba mampu untuk menimbulkan kesenangan dan juga perasaan –perasaan bahagia yang semu. Jika tidak, seseorang tidak akan mengambil resiko yang begitu besar untuk kehilangan pekerjaan, pendidikan, kesehatan dan lingkungan sosialnya. Efek yang ditimbulkan dari pemakaian narkoba adalah: hilangnya rasa kesepian, hilangnya perasaan – perasaan negatif, halusinasi, euforia berlebihan, mampu menggendalikan situasi, terbebas dari kejaran waktu, meningkatkan semangat dan rasa percaya diri. Apabila narkoba dikonsumsi secara terus menerus dan berlebihan maka pemakai akan menjadi bergantung / adiksi pada zat tersebut. Ketergantungan narkoba ini akan menimbulkan efek – efek negatif pada fisik dan juga psikologis jika pemakaiannya dihentikan, contohnya seperti: rasa nyeri pada badan, kejang – kejang, gelisah, sulit tidur, takut air, cemas, mudah tersinggung, melakukan kekerasan dan cenderung untuk bunuh diri Joewana &amp;amp; Martono (2006). Efek yang paling berbahaya dalam penyalahgunaan narkoba adalah menurunnya sistem kekebalan tubuh yang akan meningkatkan kemungkinan terjangkit virus HIV, hepatitis C bahkan sampai menyebabkan kematian (Anonymous, 2005). Pada saat ini penyalahgunaan narkoba pada kalangan remaja Indonesia menunjukan peningkatan. Berdasarkan survei nasional yang dilakukan oleh Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) yang berkerja sama dengan Pusat Penelitian Kesehatan Universitas Indonesia, pada tahun 2011 terdapat 2,2 persen atau sekitar 4 juta penduduk Indonesia yang menyalahgunakan narkoba. Dari jumlah tersebut 22 persen atau sekitar 880 ribu orang merupakan remaja yang masih berstatus sebagai pelajar dan mahasiswa(Anonymous, 2013). Dari data survei penyalahgunaan narkoba yang dilakukan BNN dan Universitas Indonesia pada tahun 2011 menyebutkan bahwa lokasi seperti Jawa Barat, Jawa Tengah, Aceh dan Kalimantan tengah angkanya relatif stabil bahkan khusus untuk daerah DKI Jakarta cenderung mengalami peningkatan. Responden yang mengikuti survei ini berimbang antara pria dengan wanita dengan kisaran umur antara 15 tahun sampai dengan 21 tahun yang masih berada dalam kelompok usia remaja. Hasil dari survei ini juga menyebutkan bahwa semakin tinggi tingkat pendidikan dan umur dari responden maka semakin tinggi juga penyalahgunaan terhadap narkoba. Angka penyalahgunaan lebih tinggi di kota dibandingkan dengan kabupaten dan lebih tinggi juga pada sekolah / perguruan tinggi swasta dibandingkan dengan yang lainnya (Nugroho, 2012). B. Identifikasi masalahDari latar belakang yang ada, dapat diidentifikasi masalah yang terjadi sebagai berikut :1.Jenis jenis narkoba2.Pencegahannya C.

      "title": "Drug misusing parents: key points for health professionals",
      "abstract": "Drug misuse is common, and users of illicit drugs tend to be young. Many have children. A serious drug misuse problem in the parents can be devastating for the lives of their children.1Addiction to opiates, most commonly heroin, is one of the forms of drug misuse that is potentially most damaging to the child's home environment. Recent figures produced by the European Commission suggest that about 0.2–0.3% of European adults fulfil diagnostic criteria for heroin addiction at any given time,2 and higher rates exist in inner city areas. Department of Health figures suggest that heroin use is the form of drug misuse most commonly presented to treatment services in the United Kingdom.3 \n\nThe financial pressure of obtaining large sums of money (typically £10–100 a day) to buy heroin can lock a person into a daily cycle of seeking out, buying, and using heroin, which can lead to poverty, criminal activity, and imprisonment.4 Chaotic lifestyles may preclude attention being given to basics such as nutrition and attending appointments, and may lead to the presence of unsafe persons in the home, unsuitable carers, and frequent parental absences. Dependent heroin users are also at greatly increased risk of death from overdose, infectious diseases, and other causes.4Addiction to stimulants such as amphetamines and crack cocaine may also produce adverse home circumstances, although anonymous testing of pregnant women suggests that there does not yet appear to be the misuse of these drugs in epidemic proportions in the United Kingdom that is reported in the United States.5 \n\nIt is difficult to obtain clear figures about the scale of parental drug use and the numbers of children affected. Each NHS region has a regional drug misuse database containing details of all new drug users presenting for treatment and those …",

      "title": "Causes of Drug Use and Methods of Legal Treatment",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction or use dates back to ancient times, with its roots lying in the human use of certain plants containing substances that alter mental states, perception, and sensations for thousands of years. These substances were used either to experience pleasure, alleviate the pain of a particular patient, endure suffering, or forget a painful life and its burdens. Drugs play a significant role in encouraging individuals to commit various crimes due to their impact on the nervous and sensory systems. Furthermore, drug abuse has become one of the most pressing problems and challenges facing our society, posing severe threats to families and youth and warning of potential disintegration. Regardless of the form or type of drug, it remains one of the most dangerous social issues and plagues that harm our community due to its profoundly negative effects on individuals, families, and society at large.One of the causes behind the prevalence of drug use is the high unemployment rate and lack of job opportunities within Iraqi society, leading to idle individuals who, with excess free time, may turn to drug addiction. Additionally, poverty becomes a bias, with the influential factor being the creation of a strong and urgent desire that drives drug users to obtain substances by any means and gradually increase their dosage. Other significant causes of drug use or addiction include family environment, bad company, working conditions, general social influences, or the desire to escape from one's social or economic reality. In some cases, sudden wealth among certain families may also contribute to drug abuse. As a result, drug abuse has become a focal issue throughout Iraq due to its destructive impact on Iraqi society. It is a primary factor in numerous social, security, economic, and health problems, leading Iraqi society to invest considerable energy and financial resources in preventing its spread and mitigating its effects on individuals and the community. This has been addressed through various legal and other means. The significance of this study lies in understanding how drug users can reintegrate into society as normal individuals without suffering from physical or psychological disorders resulting from drug addiction. This can only be achieved through understanding and addressing treatment methods and attempts to eliminate the causes of drug use or addiction. Officials must exercise caution and consider this issue to ensure that drug users are free from drugs and their negative consequences",

      "abstract": "Vaping is the use of an electronic device that heats a liquid substance which produces aerosol vapour and is then inhaled and exhaled by the user. Often (but not always) the liquid and its aerosol vapour contain nictorine,; in these cases, the devices are termed electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).– The use of vaping devices is generally described as a smoking cessation aid for use in the short term only,,–; that is, ENDS and other vaping products are neither recommended for people who do not smoke nor for long-term use in people who smoke and are trying to quit.,Nonetheless, the use of ENDS is increasing rapidly across the world,, particularly among adolescents and younger adults.,,,– Whereas the use of ENDS products in adults generally follows their use of combustible tobacco products (i.e., often used as a cessation aid), use of ENDS products in children, youth, and younger adults often begins before the use of combustible tobacco products, causing concern that ENDS and other vaping products may serve as a “gateway” to the use of combustible tobacco products — especially in younger populations.,,,There is currently limited evidence describing the health effects of ENDS and other vaping products — particularly given the wide variety of available ENDS products — including a lack of data describing associated morbidity and mortality. However, a growing body of literature describes the risk of e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury that can be caused by ENDS devices.,– In addition, there is the risk of toxicity and/or adverse reactions that can be caused by the aerosol vapour, particularly in children and youth., Concerns have also been raised about the insufficiency of current regulatory limitations in place in Canada that govern the distribution, marketing, and use of ENDS.Given the rising use of ENDS and other vaping products, as well as the uncertainty concerning their health effects, there is a need for evidence-based guidance to support vaping cessation. The purpose of this report is to identify and describe evidence-based guidelines to inform the use of pharmacological interventions to support vaping cessation.",

      "abstract": "Looking for opportunities to squeeze more physical activity into your busy lifestyle? The second edition of The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that regular physical activity is one of the most important things that we can do to improve our health, prevent chronic disease, improve brain health, improve sleep quality, and reduce the risk of anxiety and depression. Let’s look at the guidelines and some practical ways you can apply them to your life. ✓ Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Any physical activity can aid in offsetting the risks of chronic disease. Replacing sitting with anything active is likely to produce some health benefits. - Intentionally store regularly used household items out of the way. Snacks, for example, can be stored downstairs, paper towels are a walk to the garage. - Not having ice cream in the house means that if you want it, you have to make a trip to go out and enjoy that single serving. - Try an activity tracker. Most smart phones offer some form of tracking (steps or movement). Being conscious of how much you move or do not move is the first step in achieving progress. - Walk or use mass transit instead of driving. You will be surprised how much activity you gain and how much money you will save. - Head to a mall or grab a cart and go food shopping instead of ordering online. ✓ Any activity counts. Physical activity means just that — move your body. - Focus on what you do. Often we focus on what we do not do and that leads to negative thought cycles. Start with a plan of how you will add movement into each day. - Replace sitting with standing when possible. - If you cannot stand, move while you sit. You can march while seated, for example. - Make a virtual activity call with a friend. Decide on a time to chat while you both walk. - Listen to audio books or podcasts while you walk, ride a stationary bike, or do chores. - Choose the stairs. Make this a pact with loved ones or colleagues. ✓ Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefit. Surprise yourself with what you can accomplish in 30 seconds. - Try a standing desk. - Take your colleague for a walk to brainstorm instead of sitting in a conference room. - Be a movement champion — make standing and moving during meetings a workplace mission. Adding in simple, short duration movements to your day will count toward your activity goal, for example, push-ups against a wall or kitchen counter, squatting to a chair and standing up, and knee lifts between phone calls. ✓ For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. Intensity is relative to each individual. Generally, if you can carry on a conversation during activity, it is considered moderate; if you need to catch your breath between sentences, it is more vigorous; if you can only gasp a few breathy words, it is very intense. - The easiest way to conquer this recommendation is to choose activities you enjoy and make them a part of your weekly schedule. - Social support is a key ingredient to movement success. Engage a friend or loved one in your activities. Make activity dates. Many activity trackers offer challenges you can do with friends. - Try a new activity — golf, swimming, dancing, yoga, bird watching, or aquatic exercise. - Make it a family activity. A brisk walk before or after dinner or a game of hide and seek with little ones can add up to a fun habit. - Binge-watching TV? Put a stationary bike, personal rebounder (mini-trampoline), rower, treadmill, or other equipment in front of your screen. You also can march in place while watching your favorite shows. ✓ Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week. - A scheduled 45-minute walk each day plus extra opportunities to move and you can meet this easily. - Realize those times when you are doing more activity and try and replicate it. ✓ Adults also should do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits. Adding in strength activities adds so much value to how you feel and how well you function each day. Lifting your kids, pets, groceries, or aiding loved ones is a major part of life, and having the ability to continue to perform those functions builds confidence and independence and will count toward your weekly movement goals. - Use your big box shopping time to practice some heavy lifting. For example, a carton of 24 (16.9 oz) water bottles weighs about 28 lbs. Carry those around the store or around your house and you will quickly realize how important strength is. - Having a strength program prescribed by an ACSM certified personal trainer is ideal. Meet with the trainer regularly for motivation and form checks or intermittently for program updates. - Join a community center or gym and learn a quick circuit of exercises you can do in 30 minutes. - Try resistance bands at home to add weight/load to exercises. - The basics are still great. Push-ups, squats, lunges, planks, and triceps dips are great examples of body weight exercises that build strength. - If you ever tried to pull a stubborn weed or move a shrub, you understand that heavy gardening builds strength. Every moving minute counts toward making deposits in your activity account. Get moving for life.Sidebar: Stay Active on Vacation On a cruise? Never take the elevator. Visiting a new city? Take a walking tour. Communing with the outdoors? Try trail walking. Sports buff? Try a golf vacation, ski vacation, or learning to surf or paddle board. Zoos, water parks, and similar attractions require lots of movement — and make a lot of great memories.",

      "title": "What’s Pain Got To Do With It?: Young Adults With and Without Chronic Pain Perceive Minimal Risks and Moderate Benefits from Cannabis Use",
      "abstract": "Many young adults experience chronic pain and given its wide availability and potential pain reducing properties, young adults may use cannabis to self-medicate for pain. However, little is known about young adult users’ perceptions of potential health risks and benefits of cannabis, and whether these perceptions differ by chronic pain status. As a part of a larger study, young adult recreational cannabis users (N=176, ages 18-29) who reported using at least once a week completed assessments of use frequency and perceived cannabis-related risks and benefits. The sample had a high proportion of participants who met criteria for chronic pain (51.1%). The majority of the sample reported using daily or multiple times daily (80.7%) with an average of 2.68 (SD=1.42) sessions per day across administration modes (e.g. smoking, edibles, tinctures). Participants answered questions about their lifetime chances of experiencing five cannabis-related risks (personal harm, negative health outcome, negative mental health outcome, harming someone else, increased pain) and benefits (personal benefit, positive health outcome, positive mental health outcome, benefitting someone else, decreased pain; 1=Very low to 7=Very high). Overall, young adult users perceived their risk to be very low (M=1.62, SD=.73) and 40.3% of the sample had an average risk score (combined across the five risk items) of 1.00, while only one participant reported an average risk above 4.00. In particular, participants reported a low lifetime chance of experiencing personal harm (M=1.51, SD=.90), harming someone else (M=1.20, SD=.58), or experiencing increased pain (M=1.24, SD=.74) due to their cannabis use. In contrast, young adult users perceived somewhat high chances of experiencing benefits related to their cannabis use (M=4.78, SD=1.46). In particular, participants perceived a high chance of experiencing reduced pain (M=5.88, SD=1.55), personal benefit (M=4.84, SD=1.86), and positive mental health outcomes (M=4.82, SD=1.77). There was no difference based on pain status on frequency of use, average daily sessions, or perceived risks, and only one difference in perceived benefits. Participants without chronic pain anticipated more personal benefit from cannabis use (M=5.15, SD=1.74) than those with chronic pain (M=4.53, SD=1.94, t(171)=2.21, p=.03). Overall, results suggest young adult recreational users perceive very low risks of their cannabis consumption and moderately high benefits, regardless of pain status. Looking at individual areas of potential risk and benefits may yield targets for future health education campaigns. For example, perceptions of low risk/high benefits regarding mental health outcomes may not be accurate for this heavy using sample.",

In the primary stage of alcoholic consumption, it may not harm to body but some socio-economic problem may occur. Sometimes the family members as well as friends also ignore to such activities of user knowingly or unknowingly. Users often take beetle with tobacco products in order to conceal the fact, which may also harm to their body. As the time passes and if it is not controlled by him-self or family, then such person falls down to an another world, from where he does not want to come back and he makes distances from family as well as good friends. At last a stage comes where he becomes ruined socially, economically, physically and mentally. Some users even try to commit suicide due to frustration. Homicidal activities and sexual violence may also be noticed. Now-a-days alcoholism is a commonest cause for incidents of murder and rape as well as traffic accidents.

      "title": "Inhalant Abuse as an Adolescent Drug Problem: An",
      "abstract": "The inhalation of the vapors of chemical substances for the purpose of achieving an intoxicated state is currently quite popular within the adolescent popula- tion. However, this form of substance abuse often receives less attention than more well-known drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol. This paper is intended to be an introduction to the topic of inhalant abuse, including prevalence rates, the types of substances typically abused, their effects on the body, methods of inhalation, symptoms associated with this practice, the risks involved, and finally, the question of physical and psychological addiction. When the topic of substance abuse among adolescents is discussed, drugs such as marijuana, LSD, crack, and amphetamines tend to be- come focal points. One group of substances that is often overlooked or given only marginal attention is generally known as inhalants, a large number of products whose vapors can be inhaled in order to achieve an intoxicated state. The fact that these substances are abused to an equal (or even greater) extent than those drugs men- tioned above (Johnson, O'Malley, & Bachman, 1987; Oetting & Beau- vais, 1990), and yet are generally ignored by the public at large, may suggest that people are unaware of the existence of inhalant abuse, that they are unaware of the wide prevalence of this practice, and/or that they are simply unaware of the hazards involved in the abuse of inhalants.",

Pleasure or habit, one British doctor in two does not smoke, and probably more people than ever before are trying to give up smoking. This is the result of the brilliant epidemiological studies which point so strongly to the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer of the lung, and cigarette smoking and bronchitis (Smoking and Health, Royal College of Physicians 1962). Though the will may be there the way is not always easy, and a number of “anti-smoking” preparations are offered to help keep the smoker from his tobacco. They include astringent lozenges to make smoking unpleasant for him (Finifume; Nicobrevin; Terminex; Ancig; Stanwood treatment), lozenges containing a local anaesthetic and aromatic oils presumably to dull or lull his taste (present in some of the preparations named), and tablets containing lobeline to substitute for nicotine (Lobidan; Cigenda; Lobron). There are also cachous (tablets to be chewed or sucked) which are claimed to antagonise the flavour of tobacco without affecting the taste of food or drink (Nicoban).",

Die Studienteilnehmer sind je nach Grad der Nikotinabhangigkeit einer der zwei Gruppen, Raucher mit „keiner/masigen Nikotinabhangigkeit“ oder mit einer „deutlichen/starken Nikotinabhangigkeit“, zugeteilt worden. \r\nDabei stellte sich heraus, dass durchaus einige signifikante Unterschiede zwischen den stark und weniger stark nikotinabhangigen Rauchern existieren. \r\nEin ungesunder Lebensstil setzt sich aus Stress, Bewegungsmangel, fettreicher Ernahrung und dergleichen zusammen, wahrend hingegen ein gesundheitsforderliches Verhalten eine ausgewogene Ernahrung, korperliche Aktivitat, etc. beinhaltet. \r\nDie Nikotinabhangigkeit scheint dabei durchaus eine entscheidende Rolle zu spielen. So sind Auffalligkeiten, wie der Konsum einer risikotrachtigen Kost, eine geringere Bewegungsaktivitat, ein hoherer Alkoholkonsum und ein verminderter Verzehr von gesunden Nahrungs- und Genussmitteln bei den stark nikotinabhangigen Raucher festzustellen, was allesamt einem ungesunderen Lebensstil zuzuschreiben ist. Weniger stark nikotinabhangige Raucher scheinen einen gesunderen Lebensstil und ein damit verbundenes gesunderes Gesundheitsverhalten zu bevorzugen. \r\nStresssituationen sind in beiden Gruppen, den stark und weniger stark nikotinabhangigen Rauchern, Teil des Lebens. Die Verarbeitung von Stress verlauft jedoch nicht in allen Aspekten gleich. Es wird im Zuge dessen zwischen negative und positive Stressverarbeitungsstrategien unterschieden. Stark nikotinabhangige Raucher wenden stressvermehrende Verarbeitungsmoglichkeiten, anders Negativstrategien, haufiger an als die andere Gruppe der Probanden. Im Rahmen der Untersuchung der Positivstrategien sind keine derartigen Auswirkungen einer unterschiedlich haufigen Anwendung festzustellen.",

      "title": "Influence of Alcohol Addicted Parents in the Development of Alcoholic Behaviour of their Children",
      "abstract": "Alcohol addiction is simply defined as a compulsive need for an intoxicating liquid that is obtained from fermented grain or fruit. These liquids include beer, wine, and other hard liquors. One misconception that many alcoholic and addicts seem to have is that their drinking is not affecting anyone else. Many times they make statements like, “I am not hurting anyone but myself”. There is a great deal of research and a vast amount of anecdotal evidence that the behavior of addicts and alcoholics can affect everyone around them, including family, friends, employers and coworkers. Addicted family members are more likely to be violent or emotionally abusive, and when abuse is not a factor; households affected by addiction can be highly disordered, unstable and unloving. If one have a drinking problem and have children in home, they are being affected, sometimes so profoundly that the effects last their entire life time. The most vulnerable effects of alcoholism or addiction are the children. The children of people with alcohol problems usually suffer greatly. Children of alcoholics have deep-seated psychological and emotional reactions to growing up with an addicted parent. Children of addicts often grow up socially isolated and they tend to develop emotional difficulties and behavioral problems. As they grow up, these type of issues can lead to antisocial behavior, mood disorders, and drug and alcohol abuse. Children of addicts often develop feeling of anger and resentment towards their parents. Therefore alcohol addiction is recognized as significant barriers of the empowerment of children, with the consequences of child's health, their health-seeking behavior and their adaptation of the family norms. Studies have shown that a child may be more likely to follow in footsteps of his parents and have the same addictive behaviors. It is vital that children have a positive and honest relationship with their parents. Those who suffer from alcohol abuse need to seek help immediately in oreder to restore and improve the family relationship. There are many supportive groups and programs available to help those families that are dealing with addiction. the first step is realizing that one drinking has become a problem, and the second step is willing to do something about the problem.",

Un creciente cuerpo de evidencia documenta severos daños por el uso de e-cig, incluidas lesiones por explosiones de productos, intoxicación por nicotina y enfermedades pulmonares graves. Los componentes de los e-cig de uso común tienen una significativa toxicidad inhalatoria. La evidencia emergente de estudios de laboratorio sugiere un impacto en la salud por daños a largo plazo, incluido el riesgo de enfermedad cardiovascular, enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica y cáncer. No ha sido científicamente demostrada la seguridad de las e-cig o dispositivos electrónicos de suministro de nicotina (ENDS). Pruebas científicas indican que los productos varían ampliamente en la cantidad de nicotina y otros productos químicos contenidos, porque no hay forma que los consumidores descubran lo que realmente contiene el producto que ha comprado. Si en la infancia un individuo usa productos que contienen nicotina, será más fuerte su adicción y más difícil dejar de fumar. Independientemente de la presencia o ausencia de nicotina, la exposición al aerosol de e-cig en la niñez, adolescencia y edad adulta temprana no está exenta de riesgos y puede provocar toxicidad pulmonar. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) no respalda a los e-cig como ayuda para dejar de fumar, justificando este importante tema.",

Prominent key words for the categories under which respective studies were carried out are \"controlled\" or \"recreational\" drug use and drugs in \"bourgeois milieus\". Socially integrated drug use was defined as weekly cannabis herb and/or resin consumption during the last half year prior to the interview and/or at least monthly consumption of ecstasy and/or cocaine and/or amphetamines during the same time. A large majority of the socially integrated drug users had taken cannabis in the month prior to the interview, herb much than resin. Drug use of socially integrated persons is experimental or temporary; lifetime prevalence therefore is usually higher than current prevalence. General population studies consistently show that many drug users have used more than one illegal drug in their life, and that experimental use is high.",

      "title": "Consequences of concurrent and simultaneous amphetamine-type stimulant and alcohol use among young adults: hazardous drinking, antisocial behaviour, and contact with police",
      "abstract": "Background: Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) include ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) and methamphetamine and are the second most widely used illicit drugs in Australia, following cannabis. ATS use is most common among young adults aged 20-29 years, who often use these substances recreationally in leisure settings (e.g., nightclubs, pubs, bars, raves, music festivals, and parties). Prior research indicates that alcohol and illicit stimulants, such as ATS, are often combined in nightlife entertainment districts in the context of a big night out. The combined use of these substances represents an emerging area of concern, as evidence suggests that their combined use may result in greater harms than their separate use, including increased neurotoxicity, hazardous alcohol consumption, and aggression. However, despite the prevalence of ATS use among young adults and its use in settings in which alcohol is also prevalent, knowledge of community patterns of combined alcohol and ATS use is limited and research examining the potential consequences of combined use is scarce.Objectives: This thesis examines consequences of concurrent and simultaneous alcohol and ATS use among a population-based sample of young adult ATS users, focusing on: hazardous alcohol consumption, aggression, and contact with police.Methods: Data for this study are drawn from the Natural History Study of Drug Use (NHSDU), a prospective longitudinal study of drug use among a population-based sample of young adult ATS users and non-users in South-East Queensland, Australia. A brief drug use screening questionnaire was mailed to 12,079 young adults (aged 19-23 years) randomly selected from the Brisbane and Gold Coast electoral rolls, with a response rate of 49.9%. From this screening data, a sampling frame was developed from which an ATS-user group (used ecstasy or methamphetamine ≥3 times within the last 12 months, n=352) and a comparison group of non-users (random selection of the young adults who had never used ecstasy or methamphetamine at the time of screening, n=204) were recruited.Key findings: Study findings showed that alcohol use was prevalent among these young adult ATS users and was often used in combination with ATS. At the study baseline, 96.5% of ATS users had consumed alcohol in the last month and 92.9% of ecstasy users and 80.7% of methamphetamine users usually consumed alcohol during ecstasy and methamphetamine use episodes, respectively. Heavy episodic drinking was also common among ATS users, with 56.9% of female ATS users and 77.9% of male ATS users usually consuming >4 standard drinks on days of drinking at baseline. Findings indicated ecstasy use may play a role in the high rates of heavy episodic drinking among these young adults, with concurrent ecstasy use – though not concurrent methamphetamine use – associated with these hazardous patterns of alcohol consumption. While not associated with hazardous drinking, combined alcohol and methamphetamine use was shown to play a role in aggressive behaviour. Patterns of simultaneous alcohol and methamphetamine use were associated with both methamphetamine-attributed subjective feelings of aggression or hostility and acts of verbal and physical aggression while under the influence of illicit drugs. Lastly, for these young adults, engagement in illicit drug use, hazardous drinking, and antisocial behaviour likely puts them at an increased risk of contact with police. Findings showed that ATS users were more likely than non-using young adults to have experienced substance-related police contact and were more likely to have experienced more intensive police contact. Additionally, these findings suggest that police contact may impact on both substance use behaviours and perceptions of police and policing.Conclusions: This thesis extends current knowledge of community patterns of combined alcohol and ATS use and the potential consequences for young adults. Results highlighted that combined alcohol and ATS use is ubiquitous among these young adults. Further, this research indicates that the combined use of alcohol and ATS is associated with a number of concerning outcomes, including hazardous alcohol consumption, aggression, and contact with police, which have both health and social implications. Specifically, these findings suggest that young adult ATS users may be a key target group for alcohol interventions. Further, the policy challenges of alcohol, ATS use, and aggression among young adults need to be better considered in relation to the interlinking of these issues.",

Although much drug use is a social activity, apart from those under international control, many other substances are consumed, including alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and khat. Alcohol and tobacco lead to more harm to individuals and society than all of the controlled drugs combined. The sale and use of alcohol may be restricted to certain users (e.g., adults) in certain places (e.g., licensed premises) and while undergoing certain activities (e.g., driving) but there is a widespread assumption that it is not a drug. The damage caused by tobacco smoking is a long-term effect that is not immediately apparent to users. Although nicotine, the psychoactive principal in tobacco, has long been regarded as a poison, it is available in skin patches and smoking devices with little current restriction. Caffeine rarely causes serious problems to consumers. Khat is a controlled drug in the United Kingdom and a few other countries but is not under international control.",

Alcohol readily crosses the placenta and enters the fetus' bloodstream. Alcohol is metabolized and eliminated much more slowly in the fetus and in the newborn than in the mother. Recreational drugs such as heroin, methadone, cocaine, crack, and marijuana have been noted to have deleterious effects on the fetus and newborn when used by the mother during pregnancy. The exercise of pregnant women must be closely monitored because of the dramatic physiological changes induced by pregnancy. The immediate effect of exercise is that blood is diverted from the uterus to the legs. Drinking alcohol, using cocaine, and engaging in exercise programs are not isolated events randomly distributed across the population. Contradictions between animal and human studies may be due to the voluntary nature of exercise in humans, which may be less stressful than forced exercise or other stressors used in animal studies.",

Les problèmes produits par l'abus des narcotiques et du cannabis sont connus depuis de nombreuses années, et quelques pays qui auparavant n‘étaient pas très touchés par de tels abus ont récemment été témoins de l'apparition de tels problèmes, en particulier chez les très jeunes. L'abus et l'habitude de dépendre de façons croissantes de différents genres de drogues chez les jeunes se sont révélés comme un facteur important sur le plan international des drogues ces dernières années, non seulement en ce qui concerne les drogues telles que l'héroïne, la cocaïne et le cannabis, mais aussi dans le cas de drogues stimulantes telles que les amphétamines. L'emploi de drogues influençant les perceptions autres que les opiates, á savoir des sédatifs, des stimulants et des calmants a augmenté de façon prononcée dans le monde entier, á tel point qu’á la dernière séance en 1965 de la Commision sur les Narcotiques, certains observateurs eurent le sentiment “qu'il pourrait arriver une époque où le problème de l'abus des soporifiques, des calmants et des stimulants pourrait éclipser celui de l'abus des narcotiques”. Il est évident qu'il se présente un grand besoin de recherche pour établir les faits, aussi bien que de l'éducation du public professionnel et du public non éclairé dans le domaine se rapportant á l'abus des drogues et á l'habitude d'en dépendre. Zusammenfassung —Der Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von Rauschgiftmitteln stellen ein bedeutsames, weitverbreitetes und anwachsendes Problem in vielen Teilen der Welt dar. In gewissen Ländern mag die Abhängigkeit von einem gegebenen Rauschgift sogar grösser als angenommen sein, da man gewöhnlich findet, dass, falls den Ärzten einmal die Möglichkeit des Bestehens eines solchen Problems zum Bewusstsein kommt, diese Diagnose viel häufiger gestellt wird. Ausser der Verantwortlichkeit für geistigen und körperlichen Verfall des dem Rauschgift ergebenen Individuums bringen der Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von Rausch‐giften auch noch schwere sozial‐ökonomische Begleiterscheinungen mit sich, indem sie Voreingenommenheit mit Rauschgift zur Hauptbeschäftigung des Verbrauchers gestalten, Berufsverlust und Verarmung der Familie verursachen und ihn in eigenbrötlerische und antisoziale Tätigkeiten verwickeln, sowie auch seine Fahrgeschicklichkeit u.s.w. beeinträchtigen. Die Probleme, die durch den Missbrauch von narkotischen Giften und Hanf hervor‐gerufen werden, sind seit vielen Jahren bekannt und viele Länder, welcher früher von diesem Missbrauch nicht sonderlich betroffen waren, beobachteten kürzlich das Auftauchen solcher Probleme, inbesonders unter sehr jungen Leuten. Der wachsende Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von verschiedenen Rauschgiftarten unter jungen Menschen repräsen‐tierte in den jüngsten Jahren einen bedeutsamen Faktor auf dem internationalem Rausch‐giftfeld, nicht bloss in Bezug auf Rauschgifte wie Heroin, Kokain und Hanf, sondern auch auf Reizdrogen wie Benzedrin. Die Verwendung von anderen Rauschgiften als Betäubungsmittel, welche das zentrale Nervensystem angreifen, nämlich schmerzstillende, Reiz‐ und Beruhigungsmittel, hat auf der ganzen Welt ausgesprochen zugenommen; tatsächlich so sehr, dass bei der letzten Tagung in 1965 der Kommission für Narkotische Drogen einige Beobachter der Eindruck hatten, dass “die Zeit kommenz würde, wenn das Problem des Missbrauchs von Schlafmitteln, Beruhigungsmitteln und ‘Pep’‐(Aufmunterungs‐) mitteln das des Missbrauches von narkotischen Drogen überschatten würde. Offensichtlich besteht ein grosses Bedürfnis für faktenfindende Forschung sowie auch für Schulung des professionellen und Laienpublikums auf dem Gebiete des Rauschgiftmissbrauches und der Rauschgiftabhängigkeit.",

      "title": "Nicotine dependence among workers: Is it a time for smoke-free workplaces!",
      "abstract": "The adverse effects of smoking, a chronic relapsing disease, have been recognized at least since 1604.[1] Even after understanding the risks of smoking or smokeless tobacco, and also the benefits of smoking cessation, for both general and specialized physicians, smoking cessation is not on priority. Smoking or chewing tobacco is viewed as a part of lifestyle and moreover a habit which continues despite its hazardous consequences. Almost all smokers begin smoking in very adolescence under influence of numerous social factors which include mimicking of family members and friends in circle, promotion through advertising and public images, as a status symbol in society, and some get the feel of macho man via smoking. Easy accessibility and low cost of raw tobacco products also contribute to overuse of nicotine and its products. In India, 20% of total tobacco consumption is through cigarette smoking as compared to bidi smoking which accounts for around 40% of total tobacco consumption.[2] Smokeless tobacco use in the form of gutkha is also highly prevalent in countries such as India. Stressful life, workplace stress, and nature of work also influence smoking behavior of an individual. John et al.[3] studied a community sample of Northern German area and observed that higher work strain was associated with stronger relation with Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Migration in search of job from rural areas also influences the smoking behavior. Cui et al.[4] categorically demonstrated that rural-urban migrant workers manifested a high prevalence of stress in both life and work. Both forms of stress showed association with current smoking and life stress was found to outweigh the impact of work stress. The sidestream smoke also called secondhand smoke is also harmful. Many studies till now have clearly demonstrated the association between exposure to secondhand smoke at home or at work and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which may also be a dose-dependent phenomenon. Therefore, smoking at workplaces not only harms the individual smoker but also puts his/her coworkers at risk of developing harmful hazards of smoking. A study recently done in Delhi by Prashar et al.[5] and published in this issue titled, \"Prevalence and correlates of nicotine dependence among construction site workers\" raises at least three issues, namely, (i) is tobacco chewing safer than smoking, (ii) place of FTND in smokers, (iii) will smoke-free workplace help in this regard ? The authors have found more numbers of tobacco chewers than smokers in their study. Both forms have nicotine as primary substrate responsible for addiction. Three to four times more nicotine is absorbed from chewing tobacco than smoking cigarette. It has higher risk of developing oral cancers apart from other known local effects in the oral cavity. However, the absence of sidestream smoke with this form prevents others from passive smoke exposure. The authors have correlated various risk factors associated with a relatively high prevalence of smoking and tobacco use at workplaces. They have also been able to demonstrate that majority of their study population (78%) started smoking because of peer pressure, again supporting the role of workplace stress in commencement of tobacco use. Tobacco users have varying degree of nicotine dependence. Nicotine being most important psychologically active drug in tobacco causes addiction similar to heroin and cocaine. Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ) is a simple and widely used paper and pencil test of nicotine dependence and correlates with other proposed measures of nicotine dependence (carbon monoxide, nicotine, and cotinine level). Recently revised version of FTQ, the FTND is as reliable as FTQ and has somewhat higher internal consistency.[6] The authors of the present study have used this test to assess nicotine dependence in their study population and reported 51% of them being moderate to severe dependent. Moreover, 60% of themselves found it difficult to refrain from smoking or chewing tobacco in public places; further supporting the fact that FTND may also predict the outcome with nicotine replacement as a function of dose. Worksite tobacco control initiatives face a crucial challenge. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is only one of options to quit smoking. Provisions of smoke-free workplaces are an area of debate from erstwhile and difficult to implement. However, does it work? A systematic review of smoke-free policies to reduce tobacco use by Hopkins et al.[7] has identified strong evidence of effectiveness of smoking bans and restriction in reducing environmental (secondhand) tobacco smoke, reduced tobacco use among workers with added economic benefits. Another study by Michael and Stanton compared the cost-effectiveness of NRT with state-wide smoke-free workplaces. They found that smoke-free workplace policies are about 9 times more cost effective than free NRT program and opined that it should be a public health funding policy even when the primary goal is to promote individual smoke cessation.[8] David and Lois studied the motivational characteristics of smokers at workplace and revealed that <8% of the employed smokers were ready to quit smoking.[9] Given the multiple risks of smoking and smokeless tobacco use, it is imperative that successful comprehensive programs are needed to be developed to protect and promote the health and quality life of workers.",

He has smoked a pack per day for 36 years. He tried quitting “cold turkey” but felt irritable and couldn’t concentrate; he tried nicotine gum but it didn’t work. He is willing to try stopping smoking again but wonders if it is too late for him to benefit from quitting and if he ever can quit. The patient’s smoking should be tackled as a standard part of treating his presenting problem, an asthma flare. Tobacco use should be attended to at all patient visits, but respiratory or cardiac symptoms provide a special opportunity. Specific symptoms that can be attributed to tobacco use, rather than risk of future disease, can motivate smokers to change behaviour. In this case, stopping smoking will improve the patient’s asthma control.",

A child’s organs and immune system are not fully developed to offer protection from airborne and residual toxins compared to an adult. A child is unable to control their environment or escape their home environment, an adult can change jobs or leave a toxic environment. Thus, children are the most susceptible to the effects of toxins in their environment. Tobacco Smoke exposure is the greatest toxic exposure risk a child faces in a home environment. Tobacco Smoke exposure starts in the womb when the embryo embeds in the mother’s uterus and connects to their mother’s blood flow. Tobacco smoke contains many osteotoxic, nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic chemicals that significantly alter genetic material in the developing fetus and child, which has long-term health effects leading to poor bone health and skeletal diseases later in life. Three of the many thousands of toxins in tobacco smoke which are most osteotoxic, nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic are lead, cadmium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

O individuo sob o efeito das sensacoes da substância quimica nunca esta satisfeito com a quantidade consumida, fazendo-o encontrar inumeros motivos aumentar o consumo da droga. A dependencia quimica e responsavel por problemas serios: desemprego, acidentes de trabalho, prostituicao, violencia familiar e criminalidade. Nao existe uma forma de prevenir a dependencia quimica, a melhor estrategia e nao ter o primeiro contato. E uma questao que vem aumentando no pais, em todas as faixas etarias, principalmente os jovens, isso angustia os familiares e preocupa os educadores, pois e nessa fase da vida que os adolescentes sentem-se mais atraidos ao uso da droga para a autoafirmacao no meio em esta inserido.  As formas de tratamento envolvem a interrupcao da droga, seja gradativamente ou rapidamente para alcancar a desintoxicacao. A utilizacao de farmacos e feito com medicamentos ou atraves de racionamento e moderacao buscando nao forcar uma abstinencia total da droga; o tratamento com psicoterapias pode ser realizado com ajuda em grupo ou individual. O tratamento aos usuarios de drogas e um processo longo e doloroso tanto ao usuario quanto a familia que acompanha. A enfermagem desempenha um papel importante durante a reabilitacao de usuarios de cocaina, mais tambem trabalhando com a familia passando informacoes sobre a dependencia e seu tratamento, orientando, encorajando e auxiliando nos momentos de recaida, desespero e angustia.  O objetivo do estudo e esclarecer a sociedade academica as informacoes necessarias para que todos conhecam o papel da enfermagem diante de casos de dependentes quimicos reabilitados e como deve ser tratadas.  A metodologia utilizada foi uma revisao bibliografica de livros e artigos academicos, excelente ferramenta fornecendo ao pesquisador a bagagem teorica de conhecimentos e o treinamento cientifico que habilitam a producao de trabalhos originais. A partir dessa pesquisa pode-se entender como e importante o papel do enfermeiro junto ao tratamento da dependencia quimica como tambem os efeitos da droga no organismo. Indices apontam que o dependente de tais substâncias geralmente possui baixa escolaridade, problemas psicossociais, na sua maioria desempregados e com passagem policial.  A enfermagem tem o papel de educador, para isso torna-se necessario a mesma nao manter nenhum tipo de preconceito para durante assistencia, assegurando-a sua realizacao de forma integra, eficaz e eficiente.",

      "abstract": "Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or e-cigarettes or vape pens/vaping devices are battery-powered devices used to smoke or ‘vape’, a flavoured solution containing varying concentrations of nicotine, an addictive chemical found in cigarettes and other forms of tobacco products. Amongst these various types of ENDS devices, e-cigarettes are the most common type. They produce an aerosolized mixture of the flavoured liquids and nicotine, which is inhaled by the user. Nicotine is considered as one of the most addictive substances. The rapidity at which it is introduced into the body, age of first exposure and the dosage administered all add to determine the potential risk of a person being addicted to it throughout life. Nicotine addiction is established more strongly when the exposure occurs in adolescence. The various flavours and attractive designs also add to the allure of these products to the young population.\r\n\r\nENDS or e-cigarettes are manufactured in such a way to resemble conventional tobacco products such as cigarettes, pipes and cigars and common gadgets such as flash drives, flashlights or pens (Figs. ​(Figs.11 and ​and22)1. Structurally, most e-cigarettes contain four different components: a cartridge or reservoir, which holds a liquid solution containing varying amounts of nicotine with flavourings, and other chemicals (e-liquid or e-juice), namely a power source (usually a battery), a heating element (atomizer) and a mouthpiece that the person uses to inhale. They date back to 17th August 1965 when the first documented patent for this type of device was issued in Pennsylvania. Since then, it took several decades of additional propagation before mass production was initiated in 2003 in China and some other countries. Currently, there are more than 460 different e-cigarette brands with varied configuration of nicotine delivery available in the market, for example, cigar-likes (first generation), tank systems (second generation) and personal vaporizers (third generation) with over 7700 flavours2.

The consumption of addictive goods seems, therefore, to be the anti-thesis of rational behavior.

Specifically, the two-good extension of the rational addiction model is demonstrated and related to relevant policy questions. For instance, should one encourage the use of smokeless tobacco in smoking cessation programs? According to the empirical results, the answer is no. Further, should one discourage smoking by increasing the tax on cigarettes? Again, the answer is no.",

Bahkan oleh sebagian orang, rokok sudah menjadi kebutuhan hidup yang tidak bisa ditinggalkan begitu saja dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Tanpa alasan yang jelas, seseorang akan merokok baik setelah makan, saat minum kopi atau teh, bahkan sambil bekerjapun sering diselingi dengan merokok. Rokok sudah menjadi kebudayaan manusia (Jaya, 2009). Merokok adalah kebiasaan bodoh yang dapat membunuh diri sendiri dan tentu saja tidak ada yang bisa dipuji dari kebiasaan tersebut. Merokok membuat seseorang menjadi pucat, tampak tidak sehat dan keriput. Sesungguhnya seluruh perokok dewasa memulai kebiasaan mereka sejak usia remaja saat 2 mereka masih terlalu mudah untuk memikirkan konsekuensi jangka panjang dari merokok (Lovastatin, 2007). Perilaku merokok adalah aktivitas menghisap atau menghirup asap rokok dengan menggunakan pipa atau rokok yang dilakukan secara menetap dan terbentuk melalui empat tahap, yaitu: tahap preparation, initiation, becoming a smoker, dan maintenance of smoking (Maman, 2009). Jumlah konsumsi rokok di Indonesia menurut The Tobaco Atlas 2002, menempati pososi kelima di dunia yaitu sebesar 215 miliar batang. Mengikuti China sebanyak 1,634 triliun batang, Amerika Serikat sebanyak 451 miliar batang, Jepang sebanyak 328 miliar batang, dan Rusia sebanyak 258 miliar batang. Badan kesehatan dunia WHO menyebutkan bahwa di Amerika, sekitar 346 ribu orang meninggal tiap tahun dikarenakan rokok. Dan tidak kurang dari 90% dari 660 orangyang terkena penyakit kanker di salah satu rumah sakit sanghai Cina adalah disebabkan rokok (Jaya, 2009). Riset Kesehatan Dasar 2013 Kementerian Kesehatan RI menyatakan perilaku merokok penduduk usia 15 tahun ke atas masih belum terjadi penurunan dari 2007-2013, bahkan cenderung mengalami peningkatan dari 34,2% pada 2007 menjadi 36,2% pada 2013. Bahkan, yang lebih mencengangkan lagi, menurut penelitian terbaru dari Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), sebuah organisasi riset global di Universitas Washington, jumlah pria perokok di Indonesia meningkat dan menempati peringkat kedua di dunia dengan 57% di bawah Timor Leste 61%. Di bawah Indonesia ada Laos (51,3%), China (45,1%) Kamboja (42,1%).Dalam riset yang juga telah dipublikasikan dalam Journal of The American Medical",

      "title": "Influences of social stress in the rewarding effects of mdma and alcohol",
      "abstract": "La adiccion a las drogas es un importante problema en nuestra sociedad con graves consecuencias juridicas, medicas y sociales para los consumidores. Se trata de un trastorno caracterizado por la perdida de control sobre el uso de la droga, su busqueda compulsiva y la aparicion de un estado emocional negativo en ausencia de la misma. El alcohol es la droga legal mas consumida tanto por adultos como por adolescentes. Por otra parte, entre las sustancias ilegales, los datos epidemiologicos apuntan que el extasis o MDMA es una sustancia ampliamente consumida entre los adolescentes y adultos jovenes sobre todo en fiestas “rave” donde los consumidores pasan horas, incluso dias, haciendo uso de esta sustancia. La adolescencia constituye un periodo de alta vulnerabilidad debido a la inmadurez cerebral, siendo muy perjudicial en esta fase de la vida el consumo de drogas y la exposicion a situaciones ambientales negativas. En concreto, se ha demostrado que el estres social puede provocar el inicio, escalada y la reinstauracion en el consumo de drogas en modelos animales. Por ello, el objetivo del presente trabajo ha sido estudiar los factores implicados en las propiedades reforzantes de MDMA (1.25 y 10 mg/kg) y alcohol (1.25 y 2.5 g/kg), principalmente el efecto del estres social agudo y repetido en ratones macho adolescentes y adultos jovenes. Una de las tecnicas metodologicas mas utilizadas ha sido la induccion de estres por derrota social mediante encuentros agonisticos (agudos o repetidos). Para evaluar si el estres social modifica el valor reforzante de la MDMA o el alcohol se ha utilizado principalmente el paradigma de condicionamiento de lugar pero tambien se ha evaluado el consumo voluntario de alcohol (“two-bottle choice”). Este procedimiento y el de autoadministracion (“second order”) se han utilizado para estudiar los efectos de los antagonistas opiaceos mu (naltrexona y GSK 1521498) en el consumo de alcohol en ratas. Asimismo otras tecnicas conductuales han sido utilizadas para medir procesos como ansiedad, memoria, aprendizaje, interaccion social o actividad motora entre otros tras la administracion de derrota, MDMA o su combinacion. Los datos obtenidos indican que la exposicion al estres social (tanto agudo como a largo plazo) incrementa los efectos reforzantes de MDMA y alcohol y produce diferentes alteraciones conductuales, por ejemplo una reduccion de la conducta social, que pueden estar relacionadas con el incremento en los efectos reforzantes. Asimismo, la combinacion de estres y MDMA induce un importante deterioro de la memoria y el estado emocional. Los antagonistas glutamatergicos (memantine y CNQX) y la inhibicion de la sintesis de oxido nitrico (7-nitroindazole) bloquean los efectos reforzantes de la MDMA y tambien parecen estar implicados en los efectos del estres. El antagonismo de los receptores opiaceos mu disminuye la busqueda y consumo de alcohol. El avance en el conocimiento de los sistemas de neurotransmision implicados en los efectos reforzantes de la MDMA y el alcohol y en la influencia del estres sobre estos efectos puede contribuir al desarrollo de estrategias farmacologicas para el tratamiento de la adiccion a la estas drogas.",

A limited measure of success has been obtained by means of educational campaigns, psychotherapy, or pharmacological aids. Combinations of these therapeutic methods in smoking treatment clinics have produced only temporary alteration of cigarette-smoking habits.

      "title": "Smoking Sue e os Efeitos do Tabagismo",
      "abstract": "CARACTERIZACAO DO PROBLEMA: Ha milenios a humanidade convive com substancias que tem a capacidade de produzir alteracoes fisicas e mentais, dentre elas o tabaco. Ao longo deste periodo fatores culturais e sociais (como festas e comemoracoes) estao relacionados ao consumo do mesmo (BERTOLOTE, 2010). O tabaco e definido como qualquer preparacao das folhas da Nicotiana tabacum proveniente de uma planta nativa da America, sendo seu principal ingrediente a nicotina, que e um agente psicoativo. Ja o tabagismo e um vocabulo de origem francesa que se refere a condicao de dependencia da nicotina, em que o fumante apresenta graves sintomas de abstinencia (BERTOLOTE, 2010). A dependencia e caracterizada pela ocorrencia de fenomenos comportamentais, cognitivos e fisiologicos que se desenvolvem apos o uso repetido de uma dada substância e com a cessacao ou reducao do uso das mesmas, ocorre a abstinencia que geralmente e acompanhada por sinais de alteracoes fisiologicas (BERTOLOTE, 2010). O tabagismo constitui um importante problema de saude, colocando-se entre as causas mais comuns de morte por neoplasias malignas. Segundo Bogliolo (2011, p.430), “sua incidencia vem crescendo nos ultimos 60 anos, coincidindo com o aumento paralelo na producao de tabaco e no consumo de cigarros”. E tornou-se responsavel por cerca de 90% dos casos de câncer de pulmao nos homens e 70% em mulheres. Cerca de 20% dos fumantes desenvolvem câncer pulmonar. O tabagismo aumenta a chance de câncer de pulmao, de forma proporcional ao tamanho da exposicao considerando entao o numero de cigarros fumados/dia x tempo. Assim, quem fuma charutos ou cachimbo tambem tem mais risco de desenvolver câncer de pulmao. Mesmo sem inalar, existe o aumento do risco de tumores de cabeca e pescoco nos usuarios. Ha tambem maior risco em fumantes passivos, que vivem em exposicao prolongada ao ar aonde alguem esta fumando. Estima-se que a cada tres cigarros fumados por um fumante, o individuo que divide o ambiente esta inalando um cigarro inteiro (MARTINS; BRANDAO NETO; LADEIRA; DIEHL; TAKAHASKI; 2007). Na decada de 90 houve uma queda de casos e de mortes em homens com aumento em mulheres, implicando diretamente no aumento do numero de mulheres tabagistas (MARTINS; BRANDAO NETO; LADEIRA; DIEHL; TAKAHASKI; 2007). Segundo o INCA (2011) O tabagismo passivo e a 3a maior causa de morte evitavel no mundo, subsequente ao tabagismo ativo e ao consumo excessivo de alcool. O ar poluido contem, em media, tres vezes mais nicotina, tres vezes mais monoxido de carbono, e ate cinquenta vezes mais substâncias cancerigenas do que a fumaca que entra pela boca do fumante depois de passar pelo filtro do cigarro. Neste sentido, este estudo tem por objetivo relatar a experiencia de academicas do curso de enfermagem na realizacao de uma atividade educativa sobre o Tabagismo e doencas associadas, com enfoque especial no câncer de pulmao. DESCRICAO DA EXPERIENCIA: Trata-se de um relato sobre a experiencia obtida por meio de uma exposicao realizada no evento intitulado EXPOCEEP que se realizou no Centro Estadual de Educacao Profissional Pedro Boaretto Neto (CEEP), na cidade de Cascavel, estado do Parana, nos dias 21 e 22 de outubro do ano de 2011, no periodo noturno. A EXPOCEEP e um evento realizado anualmente e tem como objetivo a apresentacao a comunidade dos cursos da escola e atividades desenvolvidas pelos alunos. As academicas de enfermagem que vivenciaram essa experiencia sao oriundas da Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana (UNIOESTE) e participantes do Programa Institucional de Bolsa de Iniciacao a Docencia (PIBID) o qual possibilitou a participacao das mesmas nessa atividade. Trata-se de uma apresentacao dialogada, expositiva e nao-formal na qual utilizou-se para demonstracao a Smoking Sue, que representava o ato de fumar: o cigarro era introduzido na boca da boneca e aceso. Em seguida as academicas simulavam o ato, apertando e soltando a pera que representava o torax da boneca; apos isso a fumaca inalada passava pelo tubo de ensaio que representava o pulmao humano e as substâncias toxicas depositavam-se no tubo. A medida que os cigarros eram consumidos pela boneca, aumentava o deposito de substâncias no tubo, conferindo-lhe um aspecto escurecido, demonstrando as alteracoes pulmonares ao longo da vida de um fumante. O local escolhido foi o patio da escola, pois era um local com grande fluxo de pessoas alem de ter possibilitado o desenvolvimento da atividade minimizando os efeitos da fumaca do cigarro. Ao longo da demonstracao, as academicas abordaram conteudos referentes ao tabaco. EFEITOS ALCANCADOS: Acreditamos que a atividade tenha sido exitosa, pois a comunidade que se aproximava do local onde ocorria a apresentacao, sendo varios deles atraidos pela boneca exposta, inclusive as criancas. Houve grande interesse sobre o funcionamento da Smoking Sue e do assunto em questao nos dois dias de exposicao. Alguns visitantes participaram ativamente, relatando experiencias e esclarecendo suas duvidas com as academicas, sendo as mais comuns acerca da dependencia, fumantes passivos e câncer de pulmao. O objetivo do trabalho nao teve enfoque quantitativo, entretanto, observou-se que grande parte dos visitantes relatou ser fumante, ja ter fumado e/ou conhecer alguem nessa situacao. RECOMENDACOES: Acredita-se que essa atividade educativa tenha possibilitado esclarecimento quanto aos riscos do consumo do tabaco para a saude humana. Confiamos que atividades educativas semelhantes a essa aqui apresentada sao importantes para a formacao academica dos estudantes de enfermagem e as mesmas devem estar presentes nos curriculos de graduacao.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A review of the literature and a study of 52 patients of the 80+ age group confirmed the premise that good health habits have a positive effect on the quantity and quality of life. Not all persons can live beyond 80, but those who do can lead a better life if they live properly. A profile of these 52 subjects aged 80 or older revealed that they were of average size or thin, and of a happy temperament; they ate well and regularly, slept adequately, avoided excessive amounts of alcohol, did not smoke, used drugs sparingly, and led an active life, physically and mentally. Also, it was apparent that the rugged elderly can withstand the impact of a major illness or a surgical operation with associated anesthesia. The following factors are important for longevity: 1) pick the right grandparents, 2) keep active physically and mentally, 3) eat properly, 4) stay thin, 5) drink alcohol moderately if at all, and 6) do not smoke.",

Illicit \"snorting\" or freebase smoking has increased markedly in recent years. Decreased olfaction has been an often reported subjective complaint of cocaine abusers, but quantification of smell loss using sensitive psychophysical tests has not yet been done, leading to the present study. Eleven cocaine abusers were recruited from a drug treatment clinic. Olfaction was assessed using a butanol threshold test, the UPSIT, and a 7-item discrimination test. One patient tested anosmic, one had a mild discrimination problem, and one had a large septal perforation but was normosmic. From the present study, it appears that most cocaine abusers, even heavy users or those with intranasal damage, do not develop permanent olfactory dysfunction. It is not clear what factors may have resulted in complaints of olfactory loss in previous studies.",

The 16 subjects in the small study selected from a larger group of 99 adults with self-identified caffeine dependence clearly do not represent a cross section of the US population. Ten of the 16 had a previous substance abuse disorder (most commonly alcohol), two had a psychiatric diagnosis, and 14 of 16 were of the same sex. In addition, although subjects were not assessed for nicotine dependence, five were smokers who had a higher caffeine consumption than the nonsmokers. Obviously, caffeine consumption is markedly different from the use of drugs of abuse. For example, steadily increasing doses are generally not associated with caffeine ingestion and, of course, the destructive antisocial behavior provoked by drugs of abuse is clearly not associated with caffeine",

      "abstract": "Many cannabis users 'mature out' of their drug use, and factors of cannabis use cessation have been identified. However, very little in-depth knowledge is available about the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Criminological studies have gained interesting insights in desistance from crime, yet these perspectives are rarely used in drug research. This qualitative, three-year longitudinal study explored the processes involved in desistance from frequent cannabis use for young adults. Using a narrative approach, desisters (frequent users who successfully quit their cannabis use) and persisters (frequent users with a persistent desire and unsuccessful attempts to quit) were compared. In the course of the study, desisters mainly exhibited increasing agency and goal setting, established strategies to achieve these goals, and could envision another self. Desistance was generally induced by life events that became turning points. Persisters experienced largely similar events, but lacked goals and strategies and held external factors responsible for their life course and failed quit attempts. Identity change is at the core of desistance from frequent cannabis use, and the meaning-giving to life events and experiences is essential. Agency is a necessary ingredient for desistance, develops over time and through action, and leads to a new drug-free identity with desistance in turn increasing agency.",

      "title": "Alcohol, drugs: having fun or playing with fire?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most parents would find it impossible to give a straight answer to that question. They might perhaps say that they would be very unhappy about their child drinking at 13 years of age, but feel quite relaxed about it by the time their child was at the end of the teens. But the way they behave to their children makes it likely that their attitudes are a great deal more complicated than that would suggest. Many parents who would be horrified if their 13-year-old went to a party where unlimited alcohol was on offer would think it quite normal to let their child have a glass of wine when the family was having a celebratory meal at home. And why not? In contrast, they would probably not feel at all relaxed if their 19-year-old son or daughter was frequently drunk, drinking to relieve feelings of depression, getting into fights while drunk, or having unprotected sex with numerous different partners while drunk. So the answer to the question about how parents feel about their children and alcohol is not straightforward. Clearly the age of the child in question is a major consideration, but so is the amount drunk and the circumstances in which drinking is taking place.",

      "title": "Social psychological factors in tackling obesity",
      "abstract": "In the fight to reduce rising levels of obesity, a persistent obstacle is the psychological conflict between things people want to eat – for instance, fatty or sweet foods – and good health. People have very mixed feelings and beliefs about healthy lifestyle options. They experience positive sensations from eating foods that provide excessive calorie and salt content, yet finding the time to exercise (which in itself they may find unpleasant) is difficult. People know that rich foods are bad for them but, on the other hand, they also know that moderate exercise is good for them (1). No one escapes the psychological conflict, or ‘ambivalence’ that ensues. Yet, public information campaigns insist on simply reminding people to avoid certain foods and to exercise, rather than helping to resolve this deep-seated ambivalence. Ambivalence is an important issue because prior experimental evidence from the field of social psychology reveals it to be an important obstacle to healthy behaviour. Health-related ambivalence makes it psychologically difficult to resist the temptations of unhealthy choices. Several studies illustrate the effort required to overcome unhealthy temptations (2). In one study, young teenagers were given the opportunity to eat a large quantity of crisps, which they consumed with glee. The experimenter then presented them with a jug of Quench, a ‘new’ bright-red drink, along with a written description of its positive and negative attributes. The thirsty participants were told that they could have some of the drink, but it would be better to wait until later because supplies were short. The participants then sat alone with the drink for 10 min. During this time, the experimenter unobtrusively videotaped them and gave them an additional questionnaire to assess the ways in which they had coped with their temptation to drink the beverage. Analyses revealed that the participants tried a range of strategies to avoid drinking the beverage. Some participants moved the tasty-looking juice away from them. Others tried to focus attention on other materials that were available in the laboratory (e.g. magazines) or tried to highlight the negative (not positive) aspects of the drink in the questionnaire that the experimenter had given to them. In addition, participants even created negative attributes of the drink (e.g. that it was ‘too sweet’) that were never even mentioned in the initial, brief description. These behaviours betray a high amount of psychological effort aimed at combating temptation. More important, this effort occurred more strongly when the experimenter emphasized that the participants were free to choose whether or not to consume the beverage. Freedom of choice makes it more difficult to resist temptation. Other research and theory indicate that stress (3,4) and habit formation also impede the ability to resist temptation (5). Yet, choice, stress and habit are all inescapable or difficult to reduce. So how can we help people cope with this ambivalence? Unfortunately, there is good reason to doubt the efficacy of interventions that simply provide new persuasive information. The problem is that people who are high in ambivalence towards an issue carefully scrutinise any information that can help resolve their conflict (6,7). As a result, ambivalent individuals are more likely to pick out flaws in the messages when the messages are overly simplistic (e.g. ‘just say no’) and form more negative attitudes and behaviours towards the healthy options after detecting the flaws. Indeed, a series of studies sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council have demonstrated this type of backfire when anti-racism messages are presented to people who are highly ambivalent towards ethnic-minority groups (8). A more basic problem with a persuasive information approach is that it may fail to positively affect non-conscious evaluations of health-related behaviours. Indeed, the research on anti-racism messages revealed backfire effects of persuasive messages on implicit measures of attitude, which assess evaluations that people are unable or unwilling to retrieve from memory (9–11). Implicit measures do not ask people to directly report their attitudes but, instead, assess their attitudes without their immediate awareness or control (e.g. using subliminal presentation of stimuli). Importantly, responses on implicit measures are often discordant with self-reported (explicit) attitudes. For example, a person may explicitly report that she dislikes chocolate cake because of its perceived health impact, yet she exhibits a strong desire to eat the cake on an implicit measure (compare this with the work of Roefs et al. (12)). This difference is important because it is the scores on the implicit measures that tend to best predict actual spontaneous behaviour (13,14). Thus, it is vital that interventions manage to influence the associations tapped by the implicit measures and not just the attitudes obtained by self-report measures. It is likely that this non-conscious attitude change requires repeated and creative interventions to change attitudes – even a single powerful message might not be enough to elicit long-term non-conscious change (15). Potential clues to addressing this problem are revealed by important evidence that ambivalence has unique neurological properties. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging brain imaging techniques, Cunningham et al. found that regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), specifically the ventrolateral PFC, are more active when people make evaluations of objects that elicit ambivalence, over and above the activity associated with emotional valence and intensity, in regions such as the amygdala (16). This pattern indicates that ambivalence has unique neuropsychological substrates, which may help us understand the effects of ambivalence on behaviour. In fact, such evidence may help to solve an interesting behavioural puzzle about ambivalence. Specifically, ambivalence tends to elicit polarized responses to the objects of the ambivalence (i.e. extremely positive or extremely negative) (1), despite eliciting enhanced scrutiny of relevant persuasive messages as described above (7). In other words, ambivalent people tend to respond in extreme ways that are consistent with salient situational factors, despite resisting direct social influence. One potential resolution is that the polarization and resistance effects occur over different timescales. The studies showing response polarization have used very obvious and immediate cues (e.g. mood; good behaviour) that may be salient within a ‘teachable moment’, when a person is still processing their conflicting evaluations. In contrast, the persuasive messages require longer periods of attention and deliberation, and they may fail, partly because they are not comprehended early enough during the person’s thoughts about an object, and before the person has begun to resolve their ambivalence in a particular direction. Neurological scanning can be used to better track the time course of ambivalence (e.g. using event-related potential or magnetoencephalography) and to test whether situational cues have a different impact during the activation of brain regions that are associated with ambivalence than after this activation has subsided. Such evidence may reveal ways in which interventions can be shaped to use, rather than challenge, ambivalence. For example, it may be possible to develop signage or messages that give instant pictorial cues to healthy behaviour immediately after eliciting feelings of ambivalence about a behaviour. These approaches may be more successful than those that use drawn-out print messages for ambivalent topics. Ambivalence and difficulties in trying to resolve it are important in the health context. It is important to develop interventions that are capable of affecting the non–conscious associations that plausibly direct many unhealthy behaviours, and the tools are present to test this possibility. There are also powerful tools (e.g. brain imaging techniques) for looking more directly at the neurological structure and consequences of health-related ambivalence. The use of such tools can coincide with attempts to explore the ways in which social psychological approaches to healthy behaviour change can be adapted to suit public health interventions. We believe that this agenda should be an important aim for future research. No conflict of interest was declared.",

In the latter case, overuse destroys the user, but in the case of alcohol it destroys those around him as well. Over indulgence in alcohol is a euphemism—alcohol poisoning is more descriptive. Before one considers alcoholism one must first consider alcohol, because in all probability it has the broadest ramifications of any drug. For example, one aspect is political. The huge excise taxes collected by the government are a consideration of profound influence should a question of control come up—assuming that control is desired. Another ramification is societal—alcohol is a sort of \"pot\" or marijuana of which society heartily approves. This virtually encourages alcoholism.

      "title": "Decentering alcohol: Non‐drug pleasure and reinforcement as an alternative target",
      "abstract": "Though pleasure from alcohol is oft underemphasized, we suggest that public health messaging only needs to acknowledge (rather than emphasize) the pleasures of alcohol, to broadly accept the human propensity for pleasure, and to intentionally leverage these empirical findings by emphasizing and increasing the availability of non-drug alternatives. The opinion and debate piece by Nicholls and Hunt [1] stimulates an interesting discussion on the importance of pleasure in public health-oriented research on alcohol. We agree that pleasure is an important concept in understanding alcohol use as well as other substance use, and that public health discourse limits its own efficacy by focusing primarily on harm without acknowledging many of the benefits people report experiencing from drinking (or other drug use). This idea is broadly consistent with the behavioral science literature, which posits that alcohol can function as a positive reinforcer by producing desirable effects (e.g. enhancing social connection, inducing pleasant subjective effects) that increase the likelihood of future alcohol use. These reinforcing effects may, at least during any discrete use occasion, outweigh the costs, acute or chronic, of alcohol use [2]. Although humans are motivated by costly immediate harms [3], they are less so by delayed, diffuse, and uncertain ones [4-6]. This human aversion to immediate harms is matched by an innate, evolutionarily adaptive drive for pleasure or related positive subjective states. From a population perspective, harms associated with alcohol use are characteristically delayed, diffuse and uncertain for most people who use alcohol, if they experience problems at all, and rewards are often immediate and robust. In the case of social connection, for example, alcohol may help to facilitate a basic human need of social bonding [7, 8] while only inconsistently resulting in harms that lessen this potent reward. Ignoring the reality that many find alcohol to be pleasurable goes against the experience of many who drink and threatens to delegitimize public health messaging. A similar problem can be found in many treatment settings that focus almost exclusively on reiterating harms of alcohol while failing to acknowledge that drinking once served an adaptive function, even if for most it was maladaptive by the time treatment began. Although perhaps conspicuously absent from public health messaging research, there is a rich history of experimental work describing the pleasurable effects of alcohol and other drugs [9-12]. These studies, typically conducted in the framework described by the United States Food and Drug Administration Human Abuse Potential guidelines, seek to evaluate subjective effects like 'Good Effect' or 'Drug Liking' and determine the potential for a drug's future misuse [13]. Notably, these studies highlight the role that pleasure, or more broadly positive reinforcing effects, play in determining future behavior—behaviors that evoke greater pleasure are more likely to be repeated in the future, and a drug's 'abuse potential' is at least in part related to its ability to induce pleasure. In addition to understanding the importance of the reinforcing efficacy of alcohol, modern behavioral models of addiction have emphasized the importance of alternative, non-drug reinforcement that can effectively compete with substances [14, 15]. Research across the translational spectrum has demonstrated that behavioral allocation toward substance reinforcers is dependent upon the presence or absence of other reinforcers in the choice context [16-19]. Typically, addiction treatment focuses on explicit reduction in the value of a drug through pharmacological or behavioral methods. Interventions may instead (or may also) increase the value of non-drug alternatives that serve the same functional purpose that drugs do for a given patient. This idea is highlighted in the recent sober curious movement and the proliferation of non-alcoholic beverages (e.g. mocktails). Such approaches offer a mechanism of reducing alcohol use by introducing an alternative that, at least partly, retains many of the pleasurable functions of alcohol (e.g. social connection and acceptance, taste) and effectively serves as a competing option. Public health serves a societal function and, as stated by the authors, is built on a foundational principle that long-term rewards, such as health, are better than short-term rewards. By necessity, public health typically takes a utilitarian, rather than Kantian, approach, valuing the whole over the individual, and focuses on the health of the public in addition to those pleasures that can be paired with health. However, we agree with the authors that public health risks its legitimacy by ignoring the experience of people who primarily experience the positive, rather than the negative, effects of alcohol. Perhaps a compromise: public health messaging only needs to acknowledge (rather than emphasize) the pleasures of alcohol, to broadly accept the human propensity for pleasure, and to intentionally leverage these empirical findings by emphasizing and increasing the availability of non-drug alternatives. Public health messages that can craft a compelling and competitive narrative of pleasure in other activities may be more effective than focusing exclusively on the pleasures or perils of alcohol alone.

Tobacco use, in any form, is more popular in lower socio -economic groups. Betel -quid chewing-a mixture of areca nut, slaked lime, catechu, other spices and condiments rapped in a betel leaf-is a popular, socially accepted, ancient custom and the introduction of tobacco reinforced this practice. Chewing products are kept all day and sometimes even all night in the buccal sulcus or pouch; usually in the anterior part of the mouth in populations from North India, and in the posterior part among South Indians, colouring the mouth in red. The vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors (less than 18 years) and increasing the price of tobacco products through higher taxes, banning tobacco advertising and ensuringsmoke -free environments are crucial.Globally, at least 1 in 10 adolescents aged 13-15 years uses tobacco, although there are areas where this figure is much higher.",

The development of chronic tolerance to ethanol leads to greater and greater intake of ethanol, subsequent tissue damage, increased likelihood of more severe dependence, and the possibility of life-threatening withdrawal. The development of tolerance in the short term may encourage individuals to drink more per occasion in an attempt to recover or maintain the “glow” of the effects of alcohol experienced after the first drink. Whether or not this is important to the development of alcoholism is a matter of debate, but the existence of this acute tolerance has been known for many years. The mechanistic relationship of this acute tolerance to the chronic tolerance seen after weeks, months, or years of drinking remains to be elucidated.",

      "title": "Hardening is dead, long live softening; time to focus on reducing disparities in smoking",
      "abstract": "The hardening hypothesis proposes that as smoking prevalence declines, the proportion of ‘hard-core’ or ‘hardened’ smokers increases. The intuitively plausible logic is that less addicted and more motivated smokers are more likely to quit, leaving behind a growing proportion of ‘hardened’ smokers. If true, the hypothesis has implications for policy formulation and smoking cessation practice. For example, smokefree policies, health promotion campaigns and smoking cessation support services may need to be modified to ensure they reach and support quitting among the growing proportion of hardened smokers. Also, hardening would strengthen the justification for harm reduction strategies due to the need to provide less harmful alternatives to the increasing proportion of ‘hardened’ smokers who struggle to quit.\n\nThere are many ways in which hardening could manifest, creating multiple hypotheses which can be tested. For example, the population of smokers could become: (1) more highly addicted (eg, an increase in heavier or more dependent smokers); (2) less motivated to quit (eg, more smokers with no or low intention to quit, not making quit attempts or with lower self-efficacy about quitting); and (3) increasingly disadvantaged and marginalised (eg, more smokers who are disadvantaged or have mental health conditions). The net effect should be a reduced rate of quitting among the smoking population over time.\n\nSo what is the evidence for hardening? Most studies that have looked at the different aspects of hardening, either singly or in combination, are repeated surveys from the same population. Investigations from a variety of countries have generally found little or no …",

      "abstract": "Results Nine scenarios were found where clinical messages might improve diabetes management. Appointment Reminders. Appointments, previsit lab draws, and preventative health tasks (quarterly diabetes visits, yearly ophthamological referral) were often forgotten. Medication Reminders. Patients desire reminders for medication refills, and for taking medicines at certain times of the day. Medication Dosage Changes. Patients benefit from follow up on medicine changes, as they may become noncompliant and not tell the team. Medication Dosing Clarification. Patients sometimes misdose due to communication errors (e.g. once a interpreted as 11 tablets a day) or space medication doses improperly. Blood Glucose Testing Reinforcement. Patients forget agreements with their provider to check their blood sugar at certain times of the day. Meal Time Reinforcement. Some patients have difficulty remembering meal and snack times. Exercise Reinforcement. Patients desire reminders up to twice a day to make time for the activities they enjoy (walks, Tai Chi, etc). Dietary Reinforcement. Some patients desire reinforcement to eat less, to decrease soft drink and/or juice consumption, to eat healthier, or to drink more water. General Information. Patients desire timely access to health care information, including lab results, medication recalls, preventative health information (influenza vaccination reminders), and availability of new medications/devices for diabetes management. Discussion Patients in the pilot study enjoyed receiving messages. We learned that: Messages should be coalesced if tenmorally close. Patients preferred a single message for all tasks to be performed within a 30 minute block. Communications should be customized. Patients do not need reminders for what they already do. Monitoring patient responses is important. The system should be able to identify critical responses, so that actions can be taken quickly. Constant reminders train patients. Patients start predicting when the pages will come, and they remember what they need to do. Wireless technology is not ubiquitous. This intervention can only be used where wireless service is provided reliably. Reliability is important. Patients noticed missed messages, and failures despite reason (software issues, network freezes, patients out of service area) reflected upon the messaging system.",

      "title": "Development of Dependence in Smokers and Rodents With Voluntary Nicotine Intake: Similarities and Differences",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Smoking and vaping throughout adolescence and early adulthood lead to nicotine dependence. Nicotine withdrawal is associated with somatic and affective withdrawal symptoms that contribute to smoking and relapse. Affective nicotine withdrawal symptoms in humans include craving for cigarettes, depression, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and cognitive deficits. Methods Herein, we review clinical studies that investigated nicotine dependence in people who smoke or vape. We also discuss studies that investigated the development of dependence in animals with oral nicotine intake, nicotine aerosol self-administration, and intravenous nicotine self-administration. Results Clinical studies report that adolescents who smoke daily develop nicotine dependence before those who smoke infrequently, but ultimately all smokers become dependent in adulthood. Preclinical studies indicate that rats that self-administer nicotine also become dependent. Rats that self-administer nicotine display somatic withdrawal signs and affective withdrawal signs, including increased anxiety and depressive-like behavior, cognitive deficits, and allodynia. Most nicotine withdrawal signs were observed in rodents with daily (7 days/week) or intermittent long access (23-hour) to nicotine. Clinical smoking studies report symptoms of nicotine dependence in adolescents of both sexes, but virtually all preclinical nicotine self-administration studies have been done with adult male rats. Conclusions The role of sex and age in the development of dependence in nicotine self-administration studies remains under-investigated. However, the role of sex and age in nicotine withdrawal has been thoroughly evaluated in studies in which nicotine was administered noncontingently. We discuss the need for volitional nicotine self-administration studies that explore the gradual development of dependence during adolescence and adulthood in rodents of both sexes. Implications The reviewed clinical studies investigated the development of nicotine dependence in male and female adolescent and young adult smokers and vapers. These studies indicate that most adolescent smokers and vapers gradually become nicotine dependent. Preclinical studies with rodents show that nicotine intake in widely used self-administration models also leads to dependence. However, almost all animal studies that investigated the development of nicotine dependence have been conducted with adult male rats. To better model smoking and vaping, it is important that nicotine intake in rats or mice starts during adolescence and that both sexes are included.",

      "abstract": "The use of cannabis is most often associated with that of tobacco. While the addictive power of cannabis is low, that of tobacco is high. The regular use of both tobacco and cannabis is at the origin of the increase in dependence on each substance, which makes stopping this double consumption often difficult. This combined use can cause somatic and mental complications. Practitioners should identify this dual use, advise stopping and offer their help after a careful evaluation of both consumptions and their causes. The management includes psychotherapeutic support; If the efficacy of medications to aid stopping cannabis has not been proven to aid in stopping cannabis, nicotine replacement therapy can limit withdrawal syndrome, craving and improve patients' adherence to monitoring.The mobilization of practitioners in the management of patients and the development of effective cannabis cessation pharmacotherapies are essential.L’usage du cannabis est le plus souvent associé à celui du tabac. Si le pouvoir addictif du cannabis est faible, celui du tabac est élevé. L’usage régulier de tabac et de cannabis est à l’origine du renforcement de la dépendance à chaque substance, ce qui rend l’arrêt de cette double consommation souvent difficile. Ce double usage peut également être à l’origine de complications somatiques et psychiques. Les praticiens doivent le repérer, conseiller l’arrêt et proposer leur aide à cette fin après avoir fait le bilan des consommations et de leurs causes. La prise en charge comprend un soutien psychothérapeutique; si aucun médicament d’aide à l’arrêt du cannabis n’a fait ses preuves d’efficacité, la substitution nicotinique permet de limiter le syndrome de sevrage, le craving et d’améliorer l’adhérence des patients au suivi thérapeutique.

      "title": "Smoking cessation aids",
      "abstract": "Smoking is a practice where a substance, most commonly tobacco as dried or curled leaves is burned and the smoke is tasted or inhaled. This is primarily done as a recreational activity. But, owing to the chemicals present in tobacco, it slowly becomes addictive in nature. Few smokers use effective smoking cessation aids when trying to stop smoking. Smoking is the most important single cause of morbidity and mortality in under developed, developing and developed countries. Because smoking prevention will not affect tobacco-related mortality, quitting by current smokers is the main way to achieve positive effects on mortality. Many smokers are interested in quitting. Most of the smokers try to quit smoking at least once in their lifetime. To support smokers in their quit attempts, a wide range of smoking cessation aids is available. These comprise methods and products to assist smokers in quitting through coping with psychological or physical aspects of nicotine dependence. Meta-analyses have shown that smoking cessation courses, nicotine replacement therapy, and bupropion can significantly increase success rates in quitting. Even minimal interventions such as self-help materials have a small effect when compared with no intervention.",

      "abstract": "Pusenje je nacin konzumiranja duhana uzimanog u obliku cigara (umotanih u duhanov list), cigareta (malenih cigara umotanih u papir), i pomocu lule. Drugi oblik konzumacije duhana je žvakanje i smrkanje. Nikotin u duhanu su tvari o kojima covjek može postati ovisan. To znaci da se tijelo navikava na uživanje tih tvari te pati bez njih. Poznato je da pusenje ugrožava zdravlje i izaziva ozbiljne bolesti. Na primjer, smatra se da je trecina svih slucajeva raka izravno povezana s pusenjem cigareta. Mnogi ljudi ipak zanemaruju ovu pogibelj te nastavljaju pusiti. Smatra se da svaka popusena cigareta skracuje pusacev život za cetrnaest minuta. Vecina teskih pusaca umire od bolesti izazvanih pusenjem. Pusenje skodi i nepusacima kad borave u zadimljenu prostoru. Uvijek je bolje ostaviti pusenje nego nastaviti pusiti. Nakon prestanka pusenja pogibelj da se oboli od neke pusacke bolesti postupno se smanjuje (naravno, samo ako pusac nije vec obolio ), te nakon deset godina gotovo nestaje. Dvije najotrovnije tvari u duhanu su katran i nikotin. Zrak koji udisemo mora se procistiti prije no sto iziđe iz donjeg dijela pluca. To je svrha sluzi, ljepljive tekucine sto se zadržava u nosu i gornjim disnim putovima. Sluz kupi necistocu i bakterije, a tanke dlacice potiskuju sluz iz pluca k nosu i gornjim disnim putovima. Katran u duhanskomu dimu nadražuje disne putove, sužava ih te povecava lucenje sluzi i ometa rad plucnih dlacica. Stoga se sluz, necistoca i bakterije pocinju zadržavati u plucima. Uzrok je to onomu sto obicno zovemo pusacki kasalj, a to je zapravo znak bronhitisa (upale disnih putova). Pusaceva su pluca stoga podložnija zarazama. Devet desetina oboljelih od raka pluca su pusaci. Smatra se da je katran tvar koja je tomu uzrok. Nikotin djeluje na mozak i živcani sustav uopce. Možda je stoga upravo on ona tvar koja pricinja pusacu užitak pri pusenju. No on uzrokuje i to da se covjek navikao na pusenje puseci osjeca jadno i bolesno. Nikotin ubrzava kucanje srca i steže krvne žile, pospjesujuci nastanak bolesti srca i krvožilnoga sustava.",

      "abstract": "Nonostante il fumo di sigarette sia un comportamento dannoso per la salute, la sua diffusione e ampia e coinvolge persone di tutte le eta e di tutti i livelli socio-culturali. In particolare, il consumo di sigarette si presenta in genere per la prima volta in adolescenza ed in questo stesso periodo dello sviluppo tende o ad essere abbandonato o a stabilizzarsi in un’abitudine adulta. Diventa quindi importante indagare questa fascia di eta per capire quali siano i fattori che incidono sia sulla sperimentazione che sull’eventuale stabilizzazione del consumo. La ricerca qui presentata ha i seguenti obiettivi: descrivere il coinvolgimento nel fumo di un campione di 2.273 adolescenti che frequentano diversi tipi di scuole medie superiori; analizzare, attraverso un modello causale multifattoriale, l’influenza di variabili individuali, contestuali e sociali sul consumo di sigarette; valutare il peso dei concomitanti e dei predittori psico-sociali dell’implicazione dei ragazzi e delle ragazze. I principali risultati evidenziano come il fumo di sigarette svolga, per l’adolescente che vi e implicato, delle funzioni positive che hanno un impatto ben piu forte rispetto alla consapevolezza della nocivita del comportamento. In particolare, il fumo puo essere interpretato come un modo per esprimere l’identita adulta in eta precoce, ma anche come una modalita trasgressiva di affermazione vistosa di se, come una strategia per farsi degli amici, per essere accettati in alcuni gruppi e per rafforzare l’identificazione all’interno del gruppo. Talvolta il fumo si configura come una fuga e come un modo di occupare il in assenza di altre capacita progettuali. Tra i fattori di rischio per la stabilizzazione del consumo, la consapevolezza da parte dei genitori che i figli fumano risulta essere il piu importante; anche la bassa autoefficacia scolastica, lo scarso sostegno da parte dei genitori, l’uso casuale e non pianificato del tempo libero hanno un impatto significativo.",

Most people continue to smoke because they are tobacco dependent. This dependence is the result of the effect of repeated nicotine delivery to the brain, which is coupled with smoking behavior and the sensations and cues that are associated with it. Within a relatively short time a 'drive' or 'hunger' is created that only smoking can satisfy. Periods of abstinence produce urges to smoke, or cravings for a cigarette, as well as a number of other symptoms that can make it difficult to maintain abstinence. These symptoms typically peak within the first 2 weeks of stopping smoking and dissipate over time [2]. In addition, one of the main reasons people smoke so frequently throughout the day is believed to be to stave off withdrawal symptoms before they manifest.",

      "abstract": "Der Zusammenhang von Drogenprohibition und sozialer Ausgrenzung ist bisher nicht genügend untersucht worden. Soziale Ausgrenzungs- und Stigmatisierungsprozesse beeinflussen Lebens- und Drogenkonsumbedingungen massiv. Das selektive Drogenverbot hat erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Akzeptanz, Unterstützung und soziale Teilhabe. Nach einer strafrechtlichen Auffälligkeit durch Strafverfolgungs-/Justiz- oder Strafvollzugsbehörden werden soziale Ausgrenzungsprozesse verstärkt, die wiederum Auswirkungen auf das Drogenkonsumverhalten haben. Der Prozess der Kriminalisierung der Konsumierenden illegaler psychoaktiver Substanzen hat in Deutschland ein hohes Ausmaß angenommen. Die Zahl der polizeilich festgestellten Rauschgiftdelikte steigt seit vielen Jahren kontinuierlich an und betrifft im Wesentlichen Konsumierende mit Mengen zum Eigenbedarf (ca. 75% aller 282 604 im Jahre 2015 Delikte). Nach der Verurteilung zu einer Freiheitsstrafe erleben Drogenabhängige einen doppelten Ausschluss: von Freiheit und (in den meisten Bundesländern) vom Zugang zu anerkannten Infektionsschutz- und Behandlungsprogrammen. Zu diskutieren ist eine Reduktion der Kriminalisierungslast für Konsumierende illegaler Drogen, etwa mit einer gesellschaftlich konsentierten Regulation einer bestimmten Menge zum Eigenbedarf und kontrollierter Zugangsmöglichkeiten zu psychoaktiven Substanzen unter Wahrung des Jugend- und Verbraucherschutzes.",

      "title": "Behavioral and cognitive effects of smoking: Relationship to nicotine addiction",
      "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is an extremely complex process that involves biological, psychological, behavioral, and cultural factors. Three factors that influence smoking and that are influenced by smoking are performance, stress, and body weight. We know that if nicotine-addicted smokers are deprived of nicotine, attentional and cognitive abilities can be impaired, and such deficits can be reversed if the person smokes or is given nicotine. In nonsmokers and nondeprived smokers, nicotine enhances finger tapping, focused and sustained attention, recognition memory, and reasoning. Stress results in increased smoking, but there is little empirical evidence that smoking reduces stress. Stress reduction from smoking is likely the relief of withdrawal-induced negative mood that is experienced between cigarettes. Smokers weigh on average 3-4 kg less than nonsmokers, and the weight-gain seen after quitting smoking also averages 3-4 kg. Changes in eating and energy expenditure are responsible for the body weight changes seen during smoking cessation and relapse. We need to know the full range of conditions under which nicotine affects behavior. The mechanisms by which stress functions to maintain nicotine addiction are not well understood. We do not know what interventions are effective in addressing the stress experienced during smoking cessation. Because no effective interventions have been developed to prevent weight-gain after quitting, research should focus on the concern or perception of weight-gain. We need to understand how and why body weight concerns vary across gender, age, and ethnicity because of the implications for designing effective smoking-cessation programs.",

El presente trabajo evalua la influencia que a largo plazo presentan ciertas variables ambientales, individuales y biologicas durante la adolescencia, sobre la vulnerabilidad a los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina y su nivel de consumo en sujetos adultos. Concretamente, hemos comprobado como la exposicion durante la adolescencia al alcohol o cocaina en forma de binge, el nivel del rasgo de personalidad de busqueda de la novedad, o la pertenencia al genero masculino o femenino, influyen en la Autoadministracion de cocaina y en la adquisicion del Condicionamiento de Preferencia de Lugar (CPL) inducido por la cocaina u otras drogas en los ratones evaluados durante la etapa adulta. Ademas, dado que hoy por hoy no existe una terapia farmacologica eficaz para el tratamiento de la dependencia a la cocaina, el presente trabajo comprueba la capacidad del topiramato, un farmaco anticonvulsivante, para bloquear los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina. Asi, hemos evaluado ratones adultos expuestos a diferentes patrones de administracion de topiramato en la adquisicion, expresion, extincion y reinstauracion del CPL inducido con diferentes dosis de cocaina. Los principales resultados obtenidos indican que la exposicion a un consumo intensivo de drogas durante la adolescencia, el alto nivel de busqueda de la novedad y la pertenencia al sexo femenino, aumentan a largo plazo la sensibilidad a los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina, asi como su consumo, en la etapa adulta. Nuestros resultados indican que el topiramato potencia el efecto reforzante y la conducta de busqueda de la cocaina, por lo que no parece recomendable su uso en el tratamiento de la adiccion a la cocaina.

They are widely available in convenience stores and, increasingly, in specialty “vaper” shops. Although e-cigarettes are now regulated in Europe, we are still awaiting national regulation in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nOne can envisage three possible scenarios in which e-cigarettes are used: one good, two bad. Potentially, they could be useful to help tobacco smokers quit, replacing cigarettes and slowly dialing down nicotine levels, much as other nicotine delivery devices (gum, patches, inhalers, and so on) do. That would be a good thing, although the research that is starting to accumulate about this therapeutic use of e-cigarettes is so far not promising.2\n\nSecondly, e-cigarettes could be used to maintain a tobacco habit by allowing smokers nicotine intake in tobacco free areas, such as the workplace or home, because the vapor emitted from e-cigarettes is odorless and presumed to be not toxic. This is not so good for public health, as one of the most important incentives for quitting smoking has been …",

      "title": "Continuous nicotine exposure does not affect resurgence of alcohol seeking in rats",
      "abstract": "Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the United States and alcohol abuse can lead to alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use disorder is a persistent condition and relapse rates following successful remission are high. Many factors have been associated with relapse for alcohol use disorder, but identification of these factors has not been well translated into preventative utility. One potentially important factor, concurrent nicotine use, has not been well investigated as a causal factor in relapse for alcohol use disorder. Nicotine increases the value of other stimuli in the environment and may increase the value of alcohol. If nicotine increases the value of alcohol, then nicotine use during and after treatment may make relapse more probable. In the current study, we investigated the effect of continuous nicotine exposure (using osmotic minipumps to deliver nicotine or saline, depending on group, at a constant rate for 28 days) on resurgence of alcohol seeking in rats. Resurgence is a type of relapse preparation that consists of three phases: Baseline, Alternative Reinforcement, and Resurgence Testing. During Baseline, target responses produced a dipper of alcohol. During Alternative Reinforcement, target responses were extinguished and responses on a chain produced a chocolate pellet. During Resurgence Testing, responses on the chain were also extinguished and a return to responding on the target lever was indicative of resurgence. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the effect of nicotine on resurgence. Both the nicotine and saline group showed resurgence of alcohol seeking, but there was no difference in the degree of resurgence across groups. Future directions could involve testing alternative drug delivery techniques.",

      "title": "Vaping culture: An emerging epidemic and its impact",
      "abstract": "Madam, Over the past decade, vaping––defined as the inhalation of aerosolized nicotine produced by electronic cigarettes (“e-cigarettes”) has become prevalent among teenagers and adolescents. The modern designs, social acceptance, and wide variety of flavours have made vaping increasingly convenient, accessible, and appealing to young people. Combined with a lack of awareness about their long-term side effects, this has contributed to their growing allure compared to traditional cigarettes (1). In Pakistan, 6.2% of individuals use e-cigarettes. Originally marketed as a less harmful alternative to smoking and a cessation aid, Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) also gained popularity because some smoking cessation pills are carcinogenic (2). Although e-liquids pose a lower threat than conventional cigarettes, they still carry significant health risks that require attention. Particularly concerning is their impact on the respiratory system with association with conditions such as aggravated asthma, bronchitis, altering pulmonary function, and cognitive impairment. Users are likely to be exposed to heavy metals from the device, which may be carcinogenic or toxic to the heart and lungs. Additionally, ingredients present in the e-liquids, such as propylene glycol, can irritate the respiratory tract. Beyond physical health, vaping has also been linked to mental health problems in adolescents, including anxiety, depression, and ADHD (3). Nicotine exposure can disrupt brain development, increasing the potential of developing nicotine addiction, along with the gateway hypothesis, which suggests that e-liquids might lead to the use of more harmful substances like cigarettes and cannabis, thus undermining the very practice it was intended to avoid. This highlights the misleading nature of the product’s advertising (4). To protect future generations from the dangers of this growing trend, preventive measures are essential. Despite limited research on prevention, key public health policies should be introduced. These include allocating resources for additional research, prohibiting marketing aimed at younger demographics, and establishing an ID system to restrict purchases to individuals 18 and older. Products should be sold only through licensed retailers, and an additional tax on e-cigarettes should be implemented, along with required warning labels on each device, to discourage sales. Public awareness campaigns should educate the public, and educational programs should aim to alter the perception of vaping among students, emphasizing its negative consequences. These efforts should collectively work toward shifting the social perception of vaping from normalized to disapproved, akin to smoking (2).",

      "abstract": "Interrelationships in the use of nonmedical drug use and tobacco use are explored based on self-reports by 165 medical students at an average-sized southeastern medical school. Lifetime and current use of drugs among these students appears consistent with earlier studies. Several background and demographic characteristics are correlated with drug use; higher rates of use are found among males, older students, and students who frequently miss classes. No correlation is observed between drug use and class standing, sibling position, social relationships, or family drug use patterns. Tobacco use was found to be low among these medical students but was highly correlated with nonmedical drug use. Drug use patterns appear to have developed in high school and college, and to persist, albeit at a diminished rate, during medical school. The findings provide little support for the belief that marijuana or cocaine use substitutes for alcohol use; higher consumption of virtually any recreational drug is predictive of higher use of other recreational drugs.",

      "abstract": "Many athletes engage in unhealthy weight-control practices. This new policy statement urges pediatricians to attempt to identify and help these athletes and provides information about how to support sound nutritional behavior. Athletes may engage in unhealthy weight-control practices, particularly in sports in which thinness or \"making weight\" is judged important to success, such as body building, cheerleading, dancing (especially ballet), distance running, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, horse racing, rowing, swimming, weight-class football, and wrestling.1-3 Some athletes may use extreme weight-loss practices that include overexercising; prolonged fasting; vomiting; using laxatives, diuretics, diet pills, other licit or illicit drugs, and/or nicotine; and use of rubber suits, steam baths, and/or saunas. The majority of these disordered eating behaviors do not meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed, criteria4 for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. In two surveys of 208 female collegiate athletes, 32% and 62% practiced at least one of the following unhealthy weight-control behaviors: self-induced vomiting, binge eating more than twice weekly, and using laxatives, diet pills, and/or diuretics.5,6 Of 713 high school wrestlers in Wisconsin, 257 (36%) demonstrated two or more behaviors related to bulimia nervosa.7 In a survey of 171 collegiate Indiana wrestlers concerning their behaviors in high school, 82% had fasted for more than 24 hours, 16% had used diuretics, and 9.4% had induced vomiting at least once a week.8 Many athletes are secretive about these potentially harmful practices. Disordered eating may have a negative short-term impact on athletic performance. Athletes who lose weight rapidly by dehydration are probably impairing their athletic performance, especially if it involves strength or endurance,9 and these strength deficits may persist even after rehydration.10",

Addiction is often unintentional, and can even happen when someone accidentally misuses prescription drugs. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance followed by Nicotine, Cannabis, opiates or opiod drugs. Substance abuse and addiction have grave consequences on our existing social systems, effecting crime rates, hospitalizations, child abuse, and child neglect, and are rapidly consuming limited public funds. The intravenous drug abuser represents the fastest growing vector of HIV virus. Addiction is most commonly caused by physical and psychological changes that occur in the body and brain on behalf of drug and alcohol abuse. In today’s age of stress, a fast lifestyle, blatant media consumption and instant gratification, picking up habits like alcoholism and smoking is very easy. However, the addictive nature of these substances is strong, and it is fairly common to become dependent. The difference between substance abuse and addiction is very slight. Substance abuse means using an illegal substance or using a legal substance in the wrong way. Addiction begins as abuse, or using a substance like marijuana or cocaine. Person can abuse a drug or alcohol without having an addiction.",

Such information includes the number and type of manufactured cigarettes or cigars smoked daily, or the amount of ‘roll your own’ cigarette tobacco, or of pipe tobacco used. There is no reliable way of validating this self-reported information and it is generally felt that people underestimate the amount they smoke. Blood nicotine (or cotinine) levels vary widely and are not simply related to the amount smoked but to the way smoking is carried out as well as to quantity. Various questionnaires are available to measure tobacco consumption and an example is provided in Table 19.1.",

      "abstract": "Although individuals have used tobacco products for centuries, many aspects of tobacco use, including its administration, our awareness of its effects, and classification, have rapidly evolved. Tobacco use has been linked to a wide variety of health consequences including numerous types of cancer, emphysema, and COPD. Despite the well-documented health consequences associated with using tobacco products, some individuals continue to smoke, while others believe that use of newer, more trendy products (e.g., e-cigarettes) are associated with little to no health risk. No matter what form of tobacco product an individual chooses to use, nicotine is highly addictive and is difficult to stop using. Considering that most people begin using tobacco before the age of 18, prevention efforts are important if we are to make further progress in combating this major health concern. Many different treatment modalities exist for those wishing to quit; however, most tobacco users relapse within the first 14 days of making a quit attempt. For this reason, it is important that we continue to improve our current knowledge base regarding tobacco cessation.",

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-operated devices that produce a vapour consisting of nicotine (although some are nicotine-free), propylene glycol or glycerol, and flavourings.E-cigarettes were invented in 2003 in China and entered the United States and European markets in 2006 [1].Hence, it is obvious that no observational data on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes exist as yet.Data on the health consequences of chronic nicotine exposure is available from studies in prolonged users of nicotine replacement products [2].These data do not suggest that chronic nicotine exposure increases cardiopulmonary or cancer risk.Toxic and carcinogenic compounds may be found in e-cigarettes, but in trace amounts that are much lower than levels found in conventional cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not expose the user to most of the constituents of cigarette smoke at concentrations that are responsible for many of the tobacco-attributable diseases.Therefore, most experts believe that inhaling e-cigarette vapour is less harmful than inhaling cigarette smoke.The limited available evidence suggests a potential for e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool and/or an instrument for reducing conventional cigarette use (harm reduction concept) [3].During the past few years e-cigarettes have gained popularity, primarily among smokers who want to reduce the risk of smoking [4].The paper from Guillet S. et al. [5] adds some information about the perception and the use of ecigarettes.The authors performed a cross-sectional survey in 2013 among 300 students and instructors of the French school of military paramedical personnel using self-administered questionnaires.They found a prevalence of smoking among the 200 responders of 40%, which is higher than in the general French population.In tobacco smokers the observed e-cigarette lifetime use prevalence was 57% and was close to the 50% of smokers observed in the general population.However, the daily use prevalence was much lower, at 4% in the study population and 3% in the French population.The motivation for e-cigarette use in smokers was the intention to reduce tobacco consumption in 43% and to quit smoking in 8%.But almost half of the responders reported a decrease in tobacco consumption following e-cigarette initiation (average decrease of 5 to 10 cigarettes).Only about half of all respondents, smokers and nonsmokers, perceived e-cigarettes as being less harmful than tobacco.A 30-to 40-times higher number of adults (age ≥18 years) were surveyed in the US [6].This annual consumer-based web survey comprised 6 555 persons in 2010-2011 and 8 173 between 2012-2013.Among smokers, an increase in",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Over the past few centuries, the importance of fitness has gained prominence. Coupled with this is the idea of thinness or the need to be slender and lean as an ideal body type. Thinness and fitness are not the same but are conflated in most messages about being fit. Many individuals, especially adolescents, have been influenced by the ongoing diet culture and social media. They have an ideal body or physique and are increasingly concerned about their weight, shape, size, and body image. As an attempt to lose weight and reach their goals, individuals go to extremes and try to starve themselves and/or excessively exercise, self-induce vomiting, or misuse products like laxatives, diuretics and enemas. Starvation or other psychological discomforts can cause one to binge-eat then purge and feel satisfied for a short period of time, but it eventually leads to selfloathing. This can severely affect the individual both physically and psychologically. As this cycle continues, an eating disorder is developed. Anorexia nervosa and Bulimia nervosa are the most widely recognized, and common eating disorders. Although there is little known about the pathophysiology of eating disorders, the evidence of eating disorders in the context of fitness and thinness, the potential genetic heritability, and developmentally specific age-of-onset shed some light on the aetiology of eating disorders. Research on various reactions of a brain neuropeptide called ⍺-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone (⍺-MSH), the gut microbiota and brain axis and, the monoamines- dopamine and serotonin aid in the understanding of the pathomechanisms behind eating disorders. This review aims to discuss the characteristics, risk factors, effects and the other features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. It also elaborates on the pathophysiology of eating disorders",

      "abstract": "Perilaku merokok adalah aktivitas menghisap atau menghirup asap rokok dengan menggunakan pipa atau rokok yang dilakukan secara menetap dan terbentuk melalui empat tahap, yaitu: tahap preparation, initiation, becoming a smoker, dan maintenance of smoking (Maman, 2009).Merokok merupakan salah satu masalah yang sulit di pecahkan. Hal ini menjadi sulit, karena berkaitan dengan banyak faktor yang saling memicu, sehingga seolah-olah sudah menjadi lingkaran setan. Terlebih diketahui bahwa sebagian besar adalah remaja, kebiasaan merokok bagi para remaja bermula karena kurangnya informasi dan kesalah pahaman informasi, termakan iklan atau terbujuk rayuan teman. Banyak yang beranggapan bahwa merokok dapat menghilangkan stress. Padahal hal tersebut merupakan sebagian dari efek dari nikotin yang sifatnya memberikan rasa tenang sesaat. Di tinjau dari segi kesehatan, merokok harus di hentikan karena menyebabkan kanker di penyumbatan pembuluh darah yang mengakibatkan kematian, oleh karena itu merokok harus di hentikan sebagai usaha pencegahan sedini mungkin. Sehingga perlu adanya pencegahan dini yang dimulai dari pihak sekolah dan orang tua.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: En nuestro país las bebidas alcohólicas causan una elevada morbimortalidad en ambos sexos además de múltiples problemas sociales y legales. En la adolescencia se inician conductas que ponen en severo riesgo la salud .Casi dos tercios de las muertes prematuras y un tercio de la morbilidad en adultos se asocian a condiciones o comportamientos que comenzaron en su juventud. La ingesta copiosa de alcohol en forma reiterada puede ocasionar daños irreversibles tanto a nivel cerebral, como en otros órganos. Si a esta conducta, se asocia el consumo de bebidas energizantes, se altera el patrón de uso de bebidas alcohólicas, especialmente destiladas, ya que la mezcla mejora el sabor y potencia el consumo. A lo que se debe sumar los efectos propios de las bebidas energizantes.Objetivos:Investigar el consumo de alcohol asociado a bebidas “energizantes” en la llamada “previa”, y la permisibilidad de los padresMaterial y método: Se investigó el consumo de alcohol asociado a bebidas energizantes, en 370 personas de diferentes niveles educativos , entre 18 a 35 años, que en forma voluntaria y anónima completaron una encuesta estructurada y cerrada,en formato Google Drive la cual indagaba sobre “la previa”.Resultados:El 89% de los encuestados que respondieron la encuesta, estaban entre los 18 y 24 años; 65,4 % del sexo femenino. El 71 % manifestaron ser estudiantes universitarios, de los cuales 51% vive con su familia nuclear, del total de los encuestados 91 % consume bebidas alcohólicas, el 70% ingiere más de 2-3 medidas de alcohol y el 41 % bebió en la última semana (alcohol o mezcla). El 40% bebe alcohol con bebidas energizantes, 68% comienza a beber en su domicilio con el consentimiento de sus padres ,de éstos, 36% relata haber presentado síntomas compatibles con intoxicación, el 25% de éstas intoxicaciones ocurrieron en el domicilio en el cual viven con sus padres.Conclusión:El consumo de alcohol en jóvenes en “La previa” es problemático,tornándose más severo al asociarlo a bebidas energizantes. Cifras que coinciden con otros estudios de nuestro medio. Llama la atención la tolerancia social de los adultos. Sin duda, deben realizarse más estudios al respecto.",

      "abstract": "About 90% of people in Western countries use alcohol at some time in their lives, and 40% experience temporary or permanent alcohol-related impairment in some area of life as a result of drinking. Multiple sociocultural and environmental factors influence suicide rates, and thus studies conducted in one nation are not always applicable to other nations. Impulsivity and aggression are strongly implicated in suicidal behaviour. Constructs related to aggression and impulsivity confer additional risk for suicidal behaviour in people with alcohol dependence. Lower serotonin activity is tied to increased aggression/impulsivity, which in turn may enhance the probability of suicidal behaviour. Acute alcohol use is associated with suicide. Suicide completers have high rates of positive blood alcohol. Intoxicated people are more likely to attempt suicide using more lethal methods. Alcohol may be important in suicides among individuals with no previous psychiatric history. Alcohol dependence is an important risk factor for suicidal behaviour. Mood disorder is a more powerful risk factor for suicide among problem drinkers as age increases. All individuals with alcohol use disorders should be assessed for suicide, especially at the end of a binge or in the very early phase of withdrawal. Middle-age and older men with alcohol dependence and mood disorders are at particularly high risk.",

      "abstract": "Following a decade during which drug use by adolescents was viewed by many parents and other adults as a normal phase of development, the 1980s have been marked by growing awareness of the risks and costs of illegal drug use. Yet, despite the many successes of a burgeoning parents' movement, stimulated by the active leadership and support of the President and Mrs Reagan, drug use persists as a significant threat to the health and well-being of American youth. Physicians are in a powerful position to deliver health promotion messages to patients and their parents and have an obligation to do so whenever possible. Messages delivered on a routine basis can be influential in promoting smoking, alcohol, and drug abstinence. These messages should begin early and continue throughout childhood to reinforce and strengthen the development of healthy attitudes and behaviors. The pediatrician must never be reluctant to express his or her own views regarding the health consequences of drug and alcohol use to patients or their parents. Informed pediatricians represent formidable opposition to individuals who argue that \"experimental\" or \"recreational\" use of illicit substances during the developmental years is inevitable, normal, or harmless.",

Sexual arousal and craving are some of the reasons the youth resort to crystal (glass). Drug abuse may cause disorders in sexual function. Case report The patient was a 41 years old man. He married in age 22 years and experienced frequent intercourses with his wife from which he gained pleasure and it was his preferable method. Her wife left ten years ago. The patient started crystal administration through insufflations since seven months ago. Simultaneous with crystal abuse, wearing women's underwear was the only medium through which the patient reached sexual orgasm. Discussion A lot of psychological symptoms related to new substances (for example glass) are new to psychiatrists treating dependency in medical clinics. Fetishism may coexist with addiction as comorbidity. Another point to be mentioned is that, symptoms of fetishism increased and decreased with more and less glass administration, indicating that symptoms of paraphilia emerge as a result of glass use. In addition, prior to glass use, the patient maintained normal sexual tendencies, had experienced sexual intercourse and did not suffer from any type of paraphilia.",

In opposition to controlled drinking (moderation), the valid reasons for abstinence were reviewed. Methods ： A search was conducted through PubMed using the keywords abstinence and/or moderation. And related books were also sought. Results ：Alcoholics should not practice moderation but abstinence instead for the following reasons. 1) The core concept of the definition of addiction is ‘loss of control.’ 2) Disruption of orbitofronto-striatal functional connectivity underlying perseveration in alcoholics makes them rigid and incapable of controlling drinking. 3) To prevent brain damage caused by repeated excitotoxicity. 4) Long-term follow up studies on alcoholics’ drinking have revealed the inevitable failure of moderation. 5) Due to the reinstatement phenomenon. 6) Moderation is a step towards another relapse. 7) As addicts attach to alcohol, detachment from alcohol makes them form a healthy attachment. 8) For the sake of their loved ones. 9) Abstinence is safer and simpler than moderation. 10) Moderate drinkers do not stand for alcoholics. Conclusion : Moderation is a fit for a few addicts but abstinence is a better fit for the majority of addicts. Although abstinence should be an imperative goal of alcoholics, it should not be forced but instead chosen.",

She also reports occasional recreational use of cannabis.\n\n#### Next steps\n\nAdvise her of the risks of smoking and of alcohol and cannabis use during pregnancy. The biggest risk for her pregnancy at present is her smoking.\n\nOffer referral to a specialist pregnancy smoking cessation clinic.\n\nClarify with her how much cannabis and alcohol she is using. Brief intervention may be sufficient, but regular or heavy use of either substance may warrant referral to specialist drug and alcohol services.\n\nMany women use substances during pregnancy. For example, the global prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is 9.8%.1 Moreover, 10.4% of pregnant women in England were known to be smoking tobacco at the time of delivery.2 Prevalence of cannabis use during pregnancy in a UK cohort has been reported as 5%3 but is likely to increase over coming years.4 Pregnancy may be a woman’s first time engaging with health services and may be a motivator to stop or reduce her substance use.5 In this article we offer an overview of assessment and interventions for substance use in the perinatal period.

      "abstract": "A majority of individuals in India engage themselves in daily consumption despite the prominent warning labels on tobacco chewing products such as “Tobacco is injurious to health and tobacco kills”, “Tobacco causes painful death”, and “Tobacco users die younger”. Tobacco kills over 8 million people annually and is readily available at a meagre price in our country. Its nicotine content makes it a potent and highly addictive substance. Once an individual becomes hooked on nicotine, breaking free becomes a challenge due to the relentless grip of withdrawal symptoms and insatiable cravings. Tobacco has become a coping mechanism to help an individual navigate the stress, anxiety and emotional turmoil of life. This reliance bows to a psychological dependence that's hard to escape. Hence, the repeated and continued use of tobacco results in addiction. Its usage poses serious health risks, and there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco. From its origin in America to its global spread, tobacco’s legacy is complex and complicated. The modern-day challenges of regulations and health issues continue to evolve as society balances the interests of public health, economic considerations and an individual's freedom. In Ayurveda, Tobacco was first described as Tamakhu by Aacharya Yogratnakara in the 17th century. Combating this global threat is essential to save lives and improve public health. The need of the hour is to create awareness, which can help in decreasing the harmful effects of long-term consumption of tobacco.",

Accordingly, numerous approaches have been developed and studied that aim to prevent underage drinking. Some approaches are school based, involving curricula targeted at preventing alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana use. Other approaches are extracurricular, offering activities outside of school in the form of social or life skills training or alternative activities. Other strategies strive to involve the adolescents' families in the prevention programs. Policy strategies also have been implemented that have increased the minimum legal drinking age, reduced the commercial and social access of adolescents to alcohol, and reduced the economic availability of alcohol. Approaches involving the entire community also have been employed. Several programs (e.g., the Midwestern Prevention Project and Project Northland) have combined many of these strategies.",

Whereas craving for opioids frequently has been conceptualized as the negative reinforcer of protracted withdrawal or “drug hunger,” craving for cocaine has been conceptualized as the positive reinforcer of remembered euphoria. Medications can reduce both sustained cocaine craving and acute craving induced by a single dose of cocaine, and reductions in both types of craving are correlated with reductions in cocaine use. Furthermore, high level of craving during treatment or during cue-induced challenges predict poor treatment response and later relapse to cocaine abuse in those who have attained abstinence.",

Intervención El paciente presenta, desde el inicio de su seguimiento, una evolución tórpida derivada principalmente del consumo y de las conductas de búsqueda de sustancias psicoactivas. A los 15 años inicia el uso de tóxicos con cannabis y dextrometorfano, a los 17 años ya consumía semanalmente heroína y cocaína fumadas, dicho consumo se ha mantenido hasta la actualidad. Presenta múltiples ingresos por intentos autolíticos. Ha tenido conflictos legales llegando incluso a cumplir condenas de privación de libertad. El patrón de consumo es rígido, asociado a un interés restringido por el uso de sustancias y la experimentación de estados alterados de conciencia. Al explorar sus intereses el paciente cita las sustancias psicoactivas, la lingüística y la política china. Resultados y conclusiones: Las características clínicas más llamativas del Trastorno de Espectro Autista son la dificultad en la interacción social así como los intereses restringidos y las conductas repetitivas y esterotipadas. Suscita dudas sobre qué papel tiene el consumo de tóxicos en este caso, como síntoma (intereses restringidos que condicionan la actividad diaria), también se puede entender como una comorbilidad que ensombrece el pronóstico y evolución.

      "title": "Ingested poisons in adults",
      "abstract": "An ingested poison is considered any substance that's harmful to the body when ingested, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Any substance that's ingested can be poisonous if enough is consumed, even water. Poisons cause damage by altering cellular metabolism in a harmful or destructive way. They can act very quickly, within minutes in the case of heroin overdose, or over a period of time as with alcohol abuse. Most patients who've ingested a poison have minimal morbidity and fully recover within a short period of time. In this article, I'll discuss how to develop and utilize a general approach to the management of patients with suspected or confirmed poisoning. Unintentional or intentional? If a substance is ingested without intent to harm, it's assumed that it was an unintentional poisoning. This includes the consumption of drugs, medications, or other chemicals that are used in excessive amounts and result in an overdose. A poisoning is also considered unintentional when a substance is ingested accidentally and unknowingly, such as with children or older adults. When a substance is ingested with the intent to harm, it's considered an intentional poisoning, such as in a suicide attempt or assault on another person. When you can't make the distinction between the two because of circumstances, then the poisoning may be considered undetermined until proven otherwise. Substances most likely to be ingested include over-the-counter pain medicines, cleaning products, cosmetics, plants, prescription medications, and cough and cold preparations. Fatalities usually result from the ingestion of analgesics, sedative-hypnotics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, illegal drugs, cardiovascular medications, or alcohol.FigureTo evaluate a patient suspected of poisoning, you must discover what the likely poison is and when the ingestion occurred and assess the severity of the poisoning and the likelihood for toxicity. Nursing management is geared toward supportive care, preventing further absorption, and providing antidotes or promoting the elimination of the poison. Remember, the sequence, methods, and priorities of management are dictated by the poison and the severity of its presentation. The phases of poisoning are as follows: preclinical phase—some signs and symptoms may not be evident during this phase; the priority is decontamination toxic phase—signs and symptoms and lab changes are evident during this phase and guide treatment; the emphasis is on shortening the duration of poisoning and lessening the severity of toxicity resolution phase—this phase encompasses peak toxicity to recovery; the goal is to shorten the duration of toxicity. Initially speaking Your initial physical exam of the patient will focus on the ABCs—airway, breathing, and circulation—to stabilize him and prevent any further deterioration. Always ensure that his airway is patent; any doubt should prompt you to prepare for endotracheal intubation. Act quickly, but remain cool and observant. Signs and symptoms are important clues to identifying a poison, such as noticing there are burns on the patient's mouth. If the patient vomits, collect the vomitus and send it to the lab for analysis. Assess his vital signs, including pulse oximetry value and blood glucose level; assess and record his mental status and pupil size; obtain blood tests and urine samples as ordered; and make sure appropriate advanced cardiac life support measures are immediately available. Next, you'll want to confirm the history of the poisoning and correlate it with the information gathered from your initial survey. Sometimes you may need to talk with the paramedics, the patient's family or friends, or the police to gather sufficient information. Ask about the presence of pill bottles, medications, drug paraphernalia, empty bottles of alcohol, or a suicide note. If you suspect an overdose of medication, ask to see the pill bottles or the actual pills or ask for a description of the pills. If a substance can't be identified, call your local poison control center or check the computerized poison identification system or material safety data sheet. A computerized ID system gives you instant access to critical information about the management of exposure, such as clinical effects, range of toxicity, and treatment of specific and general categories of substances. A material safety data sheet provides comprehensive information regarding the physical properties, toxicity, physical effects, reactivity, proper storage and disposal, protective equipment, first aid, and containment process associated with a specific substance. Imaging tests may be warranted to determine the location, source, and likelihood of what was ingested. A chest X-ray may reveal undigested metals, radiopaque foreign bodies, or drug packets, vials, or supplies (called body packing, the internal concealment of illegal drugs such as heroin). Continue to assess the patient's vital signs, mental status, and pupil size repeatedly (from every 15 to 30 minutes to every hour). Check for the following: physiologic excitation (increased agitation, BP, respiratory rate, pulse, temperature, and pupil dilation) physiologic depression (coma; somnolence; diminished BP, respiratory rate, pulse, and temperature; and pupil constriction) odors (bodily or breath) acetone (fruity), caused by ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, chloroform, or salicylates bitter almond, caused by cyanide garlic, caused by arsenic, organophosphates, phosphorus, thallium, or selenium rotten eggs, caused by hydrogen sulfide wintergreen, caused by methyl salicylate. For more information about how to use assessment findings to help determine what type of poison is causing your patient's signs and symptoms, see Pinpointing poison's effects. Decontamination and antidotes After the patient is stabilized, some degree of decontamination should be initiated as soon as possible. Options include: activated charcoal to prevent further absorption (check for bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation, or significant gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding) whole bowel irrigation performed orally or via a nasogastric (NG) tube, usually in conjunction with sodium bicarbonate osmotic laxative solution; can be given after activated charcoal, especially if symptoms continue or if continued poisoning is suspected (check for bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation, or significant GI bleeding) cathartics, such as sorbitol, to decrease absorption by enhancing rectal evacuation of the poison; can be given after activated charcoal (check for bowel obstruction, perforation, ileus, electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, or renal insufficiency) administration of an antidote (see Common antidotes used in the ED). Table: Common antidotes used in the EDWith more severe and life-threatening cases, decontamination options include repeated doses of activated charcoal, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hemofiltration, and exchange transfusion. Tailoring nursing interventions An important aspect of caring for a poisoned patient is understanding the course of management thus far and tailoring your nursing interventions accordingly. Ongoing interventions include: ensuring airway patency and assessing for the risk of aspiration, especially after any gastric decontamination process (make sure adequate suctioning equipment is readily available) checking vital signs and monitoring for hypotension or hypertension ensuring telemetry monitoring is intact and active (check for ventricular tachycardias or bradyarrhythmias with hypotension) initiating seizures precautions if necessary. After successful decontamination, a short period of observation will be warranted and a disposition determination will be based on the observed and predicted severity of toxicity. Mild presentations of toxicity may only require a short period of observation for 4 to 12 hours in the ED, but moderate to high levels of toxicity may require admission to the hospital intermediate care floor, observational units, or ICU on the basis of the patient's history and clinical data. Keep in mind that any concern for an underlying psychiatric condition should warrant a consultation. Discharge may also be hindered by predisposing factors, such as likelihood for assault or unsafe home environments, unresolved intent to harm oneself or others, inadequate support services at home, financial hardship, and concern over recurrences of unintentional poisoning (such as inadequate lighting at home, multiple medications, blindness, or physical disability). Calm, cool, and collected While the management of an adult who has ingested a poison can be a daunting and frightening experience, by remaining observant and knowing where to look and whom to ask for information, you can ensure a favorable outcome for your patient.

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the foremost cause of death in the United States and is a major health problem worldwide. Clearly, the best way to eliminate the risk of smoking-related diseases, is to quit smoking. Smoking cessation has immediate and long-term benefits and substantially reduces the risk of many smoking-related diseases. Unfortunately, quitting smoking is rarely easy. For those smokers who cannot or do not wish to quit, reduction in their total smoking may represent a potential health benefit. Reduction in total smoking can, theoretically, be achieved by: 1) reducing the number of cigarettes smoked daily; and/or 2) switching to a low tar/low nicotine cigarette. Smokers, however, tend to self-adjust nicotine to maintain relatively constant levels. Reduction in tar/nicotine content or number of cigarettes, therefore, may not produce health benefits. Smoking reduction with alternative nicotine delivery, however, may represent an alternative option for smokers who cannot, or do not, wish to quit.",

      "abstract": "Resumen €€€€€€ Antecedentes €La historia de las adicciones va unida a la historia del hombre. Fumar cigarrillos, beber alcohol, mascar hojas de coca, esnifar preparados psicoactivos, beber pocimas, fumar marihuana, utilizar el opio para el dolor, etc., son ejemplos bien conocidos de algunas de las sustancias que el hombre la utilizado a lo largo de la historia o sigue utilizando. Mas actualmente, junto a las anteriores, y sus derivados industriales o quimicos, destacan las nuevas adicciones, unas derivadas de sustancias, como es el caso de la heroina, la cocaina, las drogas de diseno, el LSD, entre las mas importantes, y otras adicciones comportamentales, sin sustancia, como resultado de nuestra sociedad tecnologica, como la adiccion a Internet, al juego de azar, al telefono movil, a los telefonos eroticos, al sexo, a las compras, y a un amplio etcetera de conductas que pueden llegar a ser adictivas (Becona, 1998b).€Por ello, en los ultimos anos se incluyen distintas conductas bajo la denominacion generica de adicciones o conductas adictivas. Basadas inicialmente en el concepto de dependencia (fisica y psiquica), y evolucionando a partir del mismo, se aplicaban inicialmente a sustancias psicoactivas que ingeridas por un individuo tenian la potencialidad de producir dependencia. Con el transcurrir de los anos se observo que tambien existian conductas, que sin haber sustancia de por medio, tenian la capacidad de producir dependencia y el resto de las caracteristicas que tenian las dependencias a las sustancias psicoactivas.€Una caracteristica central a las conductas adictivas, es la perdida de control. La persona con una conducta adictiva no tiene control sobre esa conducta, aparte de que la misma le produce dependencia, tolerancia, sindrome de abstinencia y una incidencia negativa muy importante en su vida, que va a ser en muchos casos la causa de que acuda en busca de tratamiento o le fuerzen a buscarlo. Gossop (1989) definio como elementos caracteristicos de una adiccion: 1) un fuerte deseo o un sentimiento de compulsion para llevar a cabo la conducta particular (especialmente cuando la oportunidad de llevar a cabo tal conducta no esta disponible); 2) la capacidad deteriorada para controlar la conducta (especialmente, en terminos de controlar su comienzo, mantenimiento o nivel en el que ocurre); 3) malestar y estado de animo alterado cuando la conducta es impedida o la deja de hacer; y 4) persistir en la conducta a pesar de la clara evidencia de que le esta produciendo graves consecuencias al individuo. En la misma linea, Echeburua (1999) considera como caracteristicas principales de las conductas adictivas la perdida de control, la fuerte dependencia psicologica, la perdida de interes por otras actividades gratificantes y la interferencia grave en la vida cotidiana.€Si tuviesemos que hablar de diferencias entre las adicciones del pasado y las actuales, nosotros consideramos que hay tres diferencias fundamentales entre unas y otras.

      "abstract": "Women may have difficulty maintaining smoking cessation efforts due to negative affect and fear of weight gain. Dieting smokers who rely on cigarettes for affect regulation and weight management may be especially prone to weight gain and smoking relapse following initial smoking abstinence. The present study, which included 82 women smokers, assessed the relationship between dieting status, self-efficacy, and temptation to smoke and eat following a depressing or elating mood induction. Women with high levels of dietary restraint (i.e., more dieting behavior) had more confidence in their ability to refrain from smoking when in the elated mood condition, and they were more tempted to smoke when in the depressed condition. At low levels of dietary restraint (i.e., less dieting behavior), depressed or elated mood condition appeared to have little impact on women's confidence to refrain from smoking or their temptation to smoke. Dieting status seems to moderate the impact of positive and negative mood states, especially with respect to women's smoking behavior. These findings may have implications for dieters who are trying to quit smoking and also maintain their weight.",

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (ECIGs) use an electric heater to aerosolize a liquid that usually contains propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavorants, and the dependence-producing drug nicotine. ECIG-induced nicotine dependence has become an important concern, as some ECIGs deliver very little nicotine while some may exceed the nicotine delivery profile of a tobacco cigarette. This variability is relevant to tobacco cigarette smokers who try to switch to ECIGs. Products with very low nicotine delivery may not substitute for tobacco cigarettes, so that ECIG use is accompanied by little reduced risk of cigarette-caused disease. Products with very high nicotine delivery may make quitting ECIGs particularly difficult should users decide to try. For non-smokers, the wide variability of ECIGs on the market is especially troublesome: low nicotine products may lead them to initiate nicotine self-administration and progress to higher dosing ECIGs or other products, and those that deliver more nicotine may produce nicotine dependence where it was not otherwise present. External regulatory action, guided by strong science, may be required to ensure that population-level nicotine dependence does not rise.",

      "title": "Body Image Concerns, Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors in Teenagers and the Role of Tobacco Policy",
      "abstract": "Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors (UWCBs) include using diet pills, purging (vomiting or using laxatives) and fasting for 24 hours or more to lose weight. UWCBs are prevalent among teenagers, can have potentially dangerous health consequences and are precursors to eating disorders. Yet UWCBs have been largely overlooked in economics and there are few if any government or public health interventions to address such behaviors on a broader scale. Past economic research indicates that weight-conscious adolescents also use smoking as a strategy to control their weight - teenagers' demand for cigarettes may be in part derived from their demand for weight loss. In addition, research in epidemiology and public health finds that teenagers who engage in UWCBs are much more likely to smoke. This suggests that anti-tobacco policies such as cigarette taxes targeted to combat youth smoking are a possible policy lever for understanding UWCBs. If teens use cigarette smoking to lose weight, instead of or in combination with UWCBs, or if reduced smoking leads to unintentional weight gain among teens, higher taxes could have spillover effects to UWCBs. Using repeated cross-section, individual-level data from the 1999-2013 National and State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys combined with state-level policies and characteristics, this research provides evidence on the association between smoking, body image concerns and the use of UWCBs in teenagers. Results suggest that cigarette taxes reduce smoking, including for those trying to lose/maintain weight and especially among girls. Cigarette taxes increase the incidence of UWCBs, again among girls. Specifically, my main results indicate that a $1 increase in cigarette taxes leads to a 1.2 percentage point increase in UWCB participation among teenage girls, a meaningful increase relative to the overall sample prevalence of 22.3%.",

      "abstract": "Adult humans often undertake acute fasts for cosmetic, religious or medical reasons. For example, an estimated 14% of US adults have reported using fasting as a means to control body weight and this approach has long been advocated as an intermittent treatment for gross refractory obesity. There are unique historical data sets on extreme forms of food restriction that give insight into the consequences of starvation or semi-starvation in previously healthy, but usually non-obese subjects. These include documented medical reports on victims of hunger strike, famine and prisoners of war. Such data provide a detailed account on how the body adapts to prolonged starvation. It has previously been shown that fasting for the biblical period of 40 days and 40 nights is well within the overall physiological capabilities of a healthy adult. However, the specific effects on the human body and mind are less clearly documented, either in the short term (hours) or in the longer term (days). This review asks the following three questions, pertinent to any weight-loss therapy, (i) how effective is the regime in achieving weight loss, (ii) what impact does it have on psychology? and finally, (iii) does it work long-term?",

This, in turn, makes it harder\nto see our own culture in comparative perspective. The case of what we\ncall ‘drugs’ is an outstanding example. The term is used for a category of\nsubstances taken into the human body for purposes other than nutrition:\n‘drug’, in this sense, is opposed to ‘food’. Its contemporary usage encompasses two broad areas of meaning: medicinal preparations and chemically\nsimilar compounds consumed primarily for hedonistic purposes – where\nchanges in body chemistry are sought for their psychological rather than\nphysiological effects. ‘Drugs’ of both kinds are typically controlled by law,\neither by a system of medical prescription or by legal proscription, with\npenalties for their unauthorized possession; and the use of psychoactive\nmaterials in a non-medical context tends therefore to be characterized as\ndrug ‘abuse’. In this case, they are often described (particularly in American\nusage) as ‘narcotics’ – a term which more properly refers to substances\ncausing sleep or insensibility, but which now usually carries implications\nof illegality.1 The fact that they are often associated with a range of social\nand medical problems, through their use by deprived or disturbed groups\nwithin society, colours the terms in which the substances themselves are\ndescribed.",

Consumption of one or more psychoactive substances during pregnancy may have serious consequences on the pregnancy and on the child development. However, the type of consequences is still a matter of controversies. The reasons are diverse: different rating scales, potential interactions with environmental and genetic factors.

Although repeated exposure to alcohol is thought to explain tolerance development on a physiological level, the acquisition of behavioral tolerance appears to involve additional factors. In particular, learned associations between a drinker's behavior following alcohol consumption and the subsequent consequences may play an important role. When favorable consequences result from displaying unimpaired (i.e., tolerant) behavior after drinking, a drinker learns to develop behavioral strategies to compensate for alcohol's effects. In contrast, if a drinker does not receive a reward for unimpaired behavior--or finds that a more favorable outcome follows the display of intoxicated behavior--tolerance does not develop. Studies show that subjects also can develop behavioral tolerance to alcohol when they practice a task while impaired by factors other than alcohol or when they mentally rehearse task performance while under the influence of alcohol.",

People who quit decrease their rates of death and illness, including heart disease and cancer, even if they quit late in life. The benefits of quitting late in life are less than quitting when young. Helping patients quit typically involves helping them through many attempts (five to seven, on average). Because most relapses occur within three months of quitting, and half within the first two days, patients need follow up within days, not weeks, of starting treatment.\n\nIt is important to warn patients about what they are likely to experience when they try to quit.

      "title": "Shifting pharmacology of nicotine use and withdrawal: Breaking the cycle of drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death, responsible for over 400,000 premature deaths every year in the United States and weighing heavily on an economy with a nearly $200 billion combined cost of health care and lost productivity (1). Despite the deleterious immediate and long-term effects of smoking, only 3% of smokers successfully quit, although 70% of all smokers express the desire to do so (2). Nicotine is the main addictive psychoactive ingredient present in tobacco smoke (3). Chronic exposure to nicotine initiates neuroadaptation; these alterations, in turn, promote continued tobacco use. When a smoker attempts cessation, this new equilibrium maintained by nicotine exposure is disrupted, leading to the withdrawal state. Withdrawal is a series of affective and somatic symptoms that emerge a few hours after nicotine abstinence, reflecting neurochemical imbalance (4); however, the precise nature of this imbalance has remained elusive. Nicotine, as is the case with many other drugs of abuse, is known to have an impact on the dopamine (DA) system (5). Grieder et al. (6) perform a series of elegant experiments using pharmacology and electrophysiology in parallel with genetic and behavioral approaches to examine how the dopaminergic system may be involved in this process. An important aspect of their work is that it highlights the double dissociation of dopaminergic system involvement between acute exposure to nicotine and the chronic withdrawn state with respect to DA neuron activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the DA receptors that mediate conditioned place aversion (Fig. 1).",

In young children especially among toddlers aged between one- and three-years poisoning is common accidentally while they explore their environment as part of their normal natural development, or deliberately in response to stress or underlying mental problems .Young children are at a high risk of accidental poisoning when they try to discover the world around them by playing with things – opening the cabinets, mother’s handbag , imitating their parents or adult in actions especially if there is an elderly at home has one of geriatric diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mullites …and taking medication contiguously so an accidental poisoning occurs as a trial from child to learn who ingest that. The child is detected by parents or caregiver by chance while playing with a packet of tablets or with some of them in mouth. Deliberately poisoning usually happens in adolescent as attempting self-harm or suicide purpose by ingested large quantities of tablets than young children. Poisoning may be presents because of error doses which is prescribed by health professionals by wrong.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine users are at greater risk of developing alcohol dependence. Conversely, alcohol is often consumed when young people test tobacco. The prevalence of smokers is high among alcohol dependent individuals and people who overconsume alcohol get more nicotine withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit tobacco and are less likely to succeed. Alcohol as well as smoking provides a high burden of disease, and combined use often causes multiplier damage effects. Alcohol dependent persons die more often from smoking-related illness than from alcohol. Nicotine cessation is more successful if alcohol advice is included. Cross-tolerance and other interactions between nicotine and opioids increase the likelihood of dependence. Tobacco smokers need higher opioid doses against pain. Despite evidence of association between smoking and chronic pain, understanding of causality is limited. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of opioid dependence. Nicotine is recognized as an important underlying factor. Further research in humans concerning the interactions between nicotine and opioids is urgent. Treatment of nicotine dependence in the medical management of opioid dependence seems promising, but at what point in the course - simultaneously, shortly after, or far behind - has yet to be determined.",

The relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of incident dementia is however not clear. Many studies have demonstrated that alcohol consumption in mild to moderate level, compared with abstention, lowers the risk of dementia. Other studies however do not suggest such association. There are several mechanisms to describe the positive effects of alcohol consumption on the brain function. One to two drinks daily of alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, or liquor) could lower the risk of dementia. The types of alcoholic beverages are not significantly different in such association. In conclusion, it would seem that a mild to moderate level of alcohol consumption might be associated with a lower risk of dementia.",

A partial explanation can be found in an investigation of the relative meaning of the drug for the addict within his social context rather than viewing the drug simply as a pharmacological agent. The idea that addiction is a social phenomenon within the addicts family suggests a relationship between the functioning of the families of addicts and their inability to tolerate abstinence. Because the abuse of heroin or barbiturates by one family member can result in \"rewards\" for all family members, the family, in behaving as if the addict cannot control his drug use, functions in such a way as to reinforce the addiction.",

As possiveis abordagens para reduzir a exposicao a toxinas do fumo incluem a reducao da quantidade de tabaco usada e o uso de produtos menos toxicos, como produtos farmaceuticos, nicotina e potenciais produtos de tabaco de exposicao reduzida (PREPs), como uma alternativa aos cigarros.

Were it not for the truly enormous public health costs, and the intrusive nature of smoke on other people’s airspace, non-smokers would probably merely pity their deluded smoking brethren.

People with a serious mental illness are usually less healthy than those without such an illness. This may be because of the illness itself, fewer opportunities for health care, or unwanted effects of the medicines taken to treat mental illnesses. People with a long-lasting mental illness sometimes also deal with other issues, such as cigarette smoking, drug abuse, unhealthy eating habits, little exercise, and having few relationships with others. Even though it can be difficult at times, living a healthy lifestyle is necessary for patients to feel better and move towards recovery. In this chapter, we discuss problems sometimes faced by people with psychosis and ways to deal with and overcome these issues. Specifically, this chapter focuses on the importance of not smoking cigarettes, staying away from alcohol and drugs, having a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise, and having good social support from family and friends. One problem sometimes faced by people with psychosis is cigarette smoking. About one in five people in the general population in the United States (about 21%) smoke cigarettes. Fortunately, this percentage is now decreasing because of the growing awareness of the health risks posed by cigarette smoking. However, a large percentage of people with psychosis smoke. For example, most people with schizophrenia (between 50% and 90%) smoke cigarettes. What’s more, this percentage has not decreased in recent years. People with psychotic disorders also have smoking behaviors that can cause even greater harm. Some of these behaviors include smoking heavily—up to two or three packs a day—and smoking cigarettes down to the filter where the greatest concentration of nicotine is. Why are people with psychosis so likely to smoke, and to smoke so heavily? Most researchers believe that it is because of the relationship between cigarette smoking, nicotine, and the symptoms of psychosis (see Chapter 2 on What Are the Symptoms of Psychosis?). Nicotine is a drug that affects anyone who uses it. In most people, nicotine may slightly improve attention and memory.",

How can a physician help such a patient overcome his psychological need for smoking? My observations show that, when a heavy smoker is not smoking, he often unconsciously hypoventilates to a marked degree (Syndrome of Spontaneous Hypoventilation, Mississippi Valley M.

      "abstract": "Adolescents consume alcohol in moderation mainly to enjoy and enhance mood but adolescents also drink hazardously, e.g. to cope with stressful life events. Drinking hazardously may be related to the developing adolescent brain going through a number of structural and physiological changes. These structural and physiological changes affect adolescent behavior aimed at gaining experience in life. Adolescent drinking patterns vary and may include risky behaviors such as binge drinking. Motivations to drink and risk factors for binge drinking and alcohol abuse are both internal and external. Internal risk factors include amongst others genetic predisposition to have less self-control, whereas external risk factors includes early life stress. Integrative approaches underline the value of multi-domain analysis for prediction; any one feature in isolation only modestly predicts drinking behavior. Health consequences of drinking vary widely depending on dose and drinking pattern. Moderate alcohol drinking may be associated with a lower incidence of chronic disease and mental health, whereas alcohol binging and abuse appear to negatively affect social functioning mainly in the short term and mental and physical health in the long term. Resilience towards behaving non responsibly may best prevent alcohol abuse and stimulate enjoyment of moderate alcohol consumption. Limitations in current knowledge concern the interpretation of alcohol drinking being the cause for adolescent risky behavior, generalizability of findings on abusing adolescents to the general population and insufficient knowledge of relevant covariates and mediators.",

This disadvantageous decision-making and drug- seeking behavior may continue despite catastrophic personal consequences -- for example, loss of job, health, or family -- even when the drug is no longer perceived as pleasurable. A series of brain-mapping studies and neuropsychological tests conducted at BNL has shown that people addicted to cocaine have an impaired ability to process rewards and exercise control, in a way that is directly linked to changes in the responsiveness in their prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain essential for advantageously monitoring and controlling one's own behavior. Goldstein will describe her research in this field, which was designed to test a theoretical model postulating that drug-addicted individuals disproportionately attribute value to their drug of choice -- at the expense of other potentially but no-longer-rewarding stimuli and at the same time, experience decreased ability to inhibit their drug use.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug abuse occurs widely in various parts of the world. The drugs that are misused are not only cocaine, or heroin, but also drugs that are commonly prescribed. If you want to get drunk, usually use dextromethorphan (DMP) pills, but now switch to mixing herbal cough medicines with energy drinks. Herbal cough medicine is usually used as a cough reliever, but in teens today, herbal cough medicine is starting to be abused. Mixing energy drinks using herbal cough medicine are motivated by a lack of positive activities or activities, influenced by peers or the environment where the subject lives, lack of application of religious and school education, lack of the role of parents in supervising their children, easy access to herbal cough medicines and drinks energy in large quantities, and the price is cheap. The crime that occurred is not only limited to theft but also drugs and drinking. The only difference, they are not drunk with liquor, but mixed energy drinks with some herbal cough medicine sachets. CASE REPORT: We found a case of acute psychotic disorders due to cannabis use and other psychoactive substances, namely, a mixture of herbal cough medicine containing DMP and energy drinks containing caffeine, after 2 days of use, in a 20-year-old male, found a delusion and hallucinations. CONCLUSIONS: Every use of addictive substances and psychotropic substances will have an impact on life and health. The use of addictive and psychotropic substances when consumed in excess of the dose will damage some organ functions, affect the smooth operation of organ systems, and can also cause acute psychosis.",

      "title": "Nicotine Craving and Withdrawal: Impact of Cigarette Smoke Constituents and Age",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Reynaga, Daisy Dalila | Advisor(s): Leslie, Frances | Abstract: Smoking continues to be one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States. Although the majority of smokers want to quit, most will not be successful at doing so. Despite extensive research and funding devoted to finding more efficacious pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation, current therapies are not very effective at keeping smokers abstinent for over a year. The goal of my dissertation was to establish a preclinical test that would have better face validity for the development of new pharmacological therapies for smoking cessation. Current preclinical tests of tobacco dependence use nicotine alone. Here I used an aqueous cigarette smoke extract (CSE), which contains nicotine and many other constituents of cigarette smoke, to examine its effects on cue- and drug-induced craving, factors known to influence relapse. The hypothesis that was tested was that CSE would induce greater craving and withdrawal than nicotine alone. Adult male rats that had self-administered CSE were found to reinstate to drug priming alone, unlike animals that had self-administered nicotine, which required the additional presentation of drug-associated cues. AT-1001, a functional α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, attenuated drug-primed reinstatement of CSE- and nicotine-seeking behavior. However, AT-1001 was less potent in blocking drug-primed reinstatement in animals that had self-administered CSE than in those that had self-administered nicotine alone. This was the case even when nicotine alone was used to prime reinstatement in animals that had self-administered CSE, suggesting that prior CSE exposure had altered the functional role of this nAChR.Another factor known to influence relapse is withdrawal to smoking. Teenagers are especially vulnerable to the effects of withdrawal. However, although adult rats show many of the same signs of withdrawal as humans following chronic nicotine exposure, adolescent rodents do not. In this study, adolescent and adult male rats were exposed for ten days to nicotine or CSE (1.5 mg/kg/day nicotine equivalent) by intravenous injection. Chronic CSE treatment resulted in greater spontaneous somatic and affective withdrawal symptoms in both adolescent and adult rats. Furthermore, adolescents treated chronically with CSE displayed major affective symptoms, as shown by an increase in anxiety-like behavior 30 days after drug withdrawal. Mecamylamine, a non-selective nAChR antagonist, was used to investigate if nAChRs are involved in the enhancement of withdrawal observed following chronic CSE treatment. Whereas mecamylamine precipitated greater somatic withdrawal in animals treated with CSE, it did not precipitate affective withdrawal. Heavy smokers show an upregulation of nAChR through increased radioligand binding. Similarly, adult rodents show an upregulation of nAChR binding after chronic nicotine, adolescents do not. Since CSE exposure resulted in an increase in precipitated somatic withdrawal in adult and adolescent rats and also augmented nicotine-primed reinstatement, I hypothesized that chronic CSE exposure would result in enhanced nAChR binding in both adult and adolescent rats. Chronic CSE exposure results in enhanced α4β2, α3β4, and α7 nAChR binding regardless of age, in brain areas highly involved in negative aversive states of addiction. Overall, this work provides evidence that the cigarette smoke constituents influence drug-primed craving, withdrawal, and changes in nAChR properties. Smoke constituents eliminated the protective effects that adolescent rodents display in preclinical tests of nicotine dependence, and enhanced both craving and withdrawal in adults. These findings suggest that use of CSE is a more valid way to study tobacco dependence than nicotine, and should be used in preclinical tests to assess tobacco cessation therapies.",

      "abstract": "BAB 1PENDAHULUANA.Latar BelakangNarkoba merupakan singkatan dari Narkotika, Psikotropika dan zat adiktif lainnya BNN (2006). Narkoba pada awalnya digunakan untuk keperluan medis, pemakaiannya akan menjadi aman dan efektif apabila digunakan pada dosis tertentu, bentuk – bentuk tertentu dan juga pada waktu yang tepat. Narkoba menjadi disalahgunakan apabila digunakan untuk tujuan non medis seperti: mabuk, menurunkan berat badan dan menambah massa otot Anonymous (2006). Menurut Joewana dan Martono (2006) dibalik dampak negatifnya, penggunaan narkoba mampu untuk menimbulkan kesenangan dan juga perasaan –perasaan bahagia yang semu. Jika tidak, seseorang tidak akan mengambil resiko yang begitu besar untuk kehilangan pekerjaan, pendidikan, kesehatan dan lingkungan sosialnya. Efek yang ditimbulkan dari pemakaian narkoba adalah: hilangnya rasa kesepian, hilangnya perasaan – perasaan negatif, halusinasi, euforia berlebihan, mampu menggendalikan situasi, terbebas dari kejaran waktu, meningkatkan semangat dan rasa percaya diri. Apabila narkoba dikonsumsi secara terus menerus dan berlebihan maka pemakai akan menjadi bergantung / adiksi pada zat tersebut. Ketergantungan narkoba ini akan menimbulkan efek – efek negatif pada fisik dan juga psikologis jika pemakaiannya dihentikan, contohnya seperti: rasa nyeri pada badan, kejang – kejang, gelisah, sulit tidur, takut air, cemas, mudah tersinggung, melakukan kekerasan dan cenderung untuk bunuh diri Joewana &amp;amp; Martono (2006). Efek yang paling berbahaya dalam penyalahgunaan narkoba adalah menurunnya sistem kekebalan tubuh yang akan meningkatkan kemungkinan terjangkit virus HIV, hepatitis C bahkan sampai menyebabkan kematian (Anonymous, 2005). Pada saat ini penyalahgunaan narkoba pada kalangan remaja Indonesia menunjukan peningkatan. Berdasarkan survei nasional yang dilakukan oleh Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) yang berkerja sama dengan Pusat Penelitian Kesehatan Universitas Indonesia, pada tahun 2011 terdapat 2,2 persen atau sekitar 4 juta penduduk Indonesia yang menyalahgunakan narkoba. Dari jumlah tersebut 22 persen atau sekitar 880 ribu orang merupakan remaja yang masih berstatus sebagai pelajar dan mahasiswa(Anonymous, 2013). Dari data survei penyalahgunaan narkoba yang dilakukan BNN dan Universitas Indonesia pada tahun 2011 menyebutkan bahwa lokasi seperti Jawa Barat, Jawa Tengah, Aceh dan Kalimantan tengah angkanya relatif stabil bahkan khusus untuk daerah DKI Jakarta cenderung mengalami peningkatan. Responden yang mengikuti survei ini berimbang antara pria dengan wanita dengan kisaran umur antara 15 tahun sampai dengan 21 tahun yang masih berada dalam kelompok usia remaja. Hasil dari survei ini juga menyebutkan bahwa semakin tinggi tingkat pendidikan dan umur dari responden maka semakin tinggi juga penyalahgunaan terhadap narkoba. Angka penyalahgunaan lebih tinggi di kota dibandingkan dengan kabupaten dan lebih tinggi juga pada sekolah / perguruan tinggi swasta dibandingkan dengan yang lainnya (Nugroho, 2012). B. Identifikasi masalahDari latar belakang yang ada, dapat diidentifikasi masalah yang terjadi sebagai berikut :1.Jenis jenis narkoba2.Pencegahannya C. Pembatasan masalah Makalah ini hanya membahas tentang jenis jenis narkoba Dan cara pencegahannya.D. Rumusan masalahBerdasarkan latar belakang masalah, maka dapat dirumuskan masalah sebagai berikut:1.Apa saja jenis jenis narkoba yang di konsumsi masyarakat?2.Bagaimana pencegahannya?E.

A pesar de que estos potentes psicoestimulantes comparten muchos efectos agudos y cronicos, existen algunas diferencias importantes entre el tipo de consumidor y las consecuencias de su consumo. Este articulo presenta la informacion proporcionada por las cohortes de dos grupos de pacientes adictos a la cocaina y a la metanfetamina. Ambos grupos comenzaron a la vez un tratamiento en el mismo centro y durante el mismo periodo de tiempo de cuatro anos. Los modelos de consumo difieren de forma significativa; los consumidores de cocaina siguen un modelo con mas episodios de consumo de droga, gastan mas dinero en la compra de cocaina y consumen alcohol en mayor grado. Por otro lado, el modelo de consumidores de metanfetamina incluye una proporcion mayor de mujeres, normalmente consumen la droga a diario, consumen marihuana con mas frecuencia y experimentan consecuencias medicas y psiquiatricas mas severas. A pesar de las diferencias en los efectos estimulantes de las dos drogas y en las consecuencias que estas puedan tener en los adictos, las respuestas al tratamiento con un amplio programa ambulatorio, son muy similares.",

Younger people under 20, took nearly exclusively tablets, which they accidentally found at home. Elder patients over 50, used nearly exclusively prescribed drugs. The typical patients attitudes to this suicidal method gives us the right to speak about such suicide attempts as \"attempts by tablets\". The pharmacological substance is unimportant and plays a secondary role.

The mechanisms by which drugs impair taste are numerous, and may be related to drug chemical structure. The treatment of taste disturbances is empiric and has limited success. Treatments include: shifting drugs within the same class, zinc replacement (proven to enhance taste sensation for sweet, bitter and salty flavors), palliative measures (use of mints, sugarless chewing-gums, and bicarbonate mouthwashes), niacin and vitamin A ameliorate hypo and dysgeusia.Disturbed taste sensation is common among the elderly, and should be considered whenever unexplained nutritional decline is present. Scrupulous drug screening is mandatory, and other intervention modalities can be beneficial.",

On the one hand, there are supporters for the view that tobacco addiction equates to other addictive diseases. Others argue for classifying smoking as either simply a lifestyle choice or, at worst, a lack of consistent commitment to quit.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that motivating a smoker to stop consuming tobacco is a key piece of primary prevention, by preventing cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancies, to name just a few. However, classifying smoking as an addictive disease has far-reaching and practical implications for treatment: abstinence needs to be promoted and stabilized with the help of medically supported psychotherapeutic interventions as well as simple motivational measures. Moreover, withdrawal should be supported with medication.",

A combination of reduced fluid intake, physical activity and drug-induced hyperthermia leads to complications such as heat stroke, delirium and potentially death. The clinician needs to be aware of the variety of pharmacologically active substances available in the recreational marketplace in order to diagnose and manage these patients. Recreational misadventure, because of incorrect dosage or mixing multiple substances, is a common reason for teenagers presenting to hospital with toxidromes. Death from club drug overdose is more likely to be associated with suicidal intent, related risky behaviour and trauma, as well as the inherent toxicity of the drug itself. Although many teenagers are concerned about 'drink spiking' with club drugs, the most common agent causing drink spiking incidents is ethanol.",

In excess, cerebral depression may occur, and, with the coexisting depression of the vaso‐motor centre, may lower the blood‐pressure to such an extent that collapse may be induced. 4. The amount of nicotine inhaled during smoking depends not so much on the tobacco smoked, as upon the form in which it is smoked.

      "abstract": "El consumo de sustancias adictivas por la poblacion adolescente constituye un creciente problema de origen multifactorial que excede al ambito cientifico, con un impacto social y sanitario considerables y unas connotaciones legales, educativas y politicas que exigen un analisis minucioso desde diferentes perspectivas. Entre dichas sustancias, el alcohol se mantiene como la droga mas consumida por los adolescentes. Paralelamente, el fomento de la practica regular de actividad fisica y deportiva se ha convertido en un objetivo basico en las politicas educativa y sanitaria de los paises desarrollados. En este contexto, la practica de ejercicio fisico se encontraria en un nivel elevado de los elementos que integran un estilo de vida saludable, ya que se puede considerar como la pieza angular sobre la que vertebrar la mejora efectiva de la salud de la poblacion como complemento del resto, tales como la alimentacion, el control del peso, el consumo de tabaco y alcohol y el nivel de descanso, entre otros, a la vez que, por si mismo, provoca mejoras duraderas en quienes lo practican y se ha asociado a la reduccion de conductas de consumo de sustancias toxicas. Los objetivos mas destacados de la presente tesis doctoral se centran en observar el nivel de condicion fisica relacionada con la salud en adolescentes segun el sexo y las distintas franjas de edad incluidas en la investigacion y, por otro lado, analizar y comparar el efecto que el habito de consumo de alcohol posee sobre el nivel de condicion fisica relacionada con la salud de los adolescentes, estableciendo diferencias en relacion con el sexo y las distintas franjas de edad incluidas en la investigacion. Para conocer la relacion del habito del consumo de alcohol con los niveles de condicion fisica salud de los adolescentes de la Region de Murcia se selecciono una muestra aleatoria de 533 adolescentes pertenecientes a los niveles educativos de Educacion Secundaria Obligatoria (E.S.O.) y Bachillerato distribuida de forma proporcionada en las cinco comarcas naturales en que queda estructurada la Region de Murcia. Hemos tenido que valorar el nivel de condicion fisica de los adolescentes y, por otro lado, la observacion del habito de consumo de alcohol. Para llevar a cabo esta valoracion hemos desarrollado dos instrumentos de evaluacion y registro de la informacion relativo a cada una de las dos dimensiones mencionadas. Para la evaluacion y registro de los diversos semblantes relativos al consumo de alcohol por parte de los adolescentes, se desarrollo un cuestionario de opinion que recogia aspectos propuestos por diversas investigaciones previas y que intenta mostrar el perfil del consumo de alcohol entre los adolescentes con edades comprendidas entre 14 y 17 anos. Por otro lado, para evaluar la condicion fisica relacionada con la salud se realizo una busqueda bibliografica sobre los diferentes tests condicionales y coordinativos existentes. A partir de aqui se seleccionaron todos aquellos que podian adaptarse con mayor facilidad al entorno educativo. Definitivamente fueron seleccionadas las siguientes pruebas: Ruffier, Fuerza de prension mediante dinamometria manual, fuerza-resistencia abdominal, flexibilidad (Distancia Dedos Planta -DDP), Manejo del balon con la mano, Manejo del balon con el pie, Circuito de agilidad y Prueba de lanzamiento-recepcion. El consumo de alcohol se ha mostrado en la presente investigacion como uno de los habitos nocivos para la salud mas preocupantes para la etapa adolescente, ocupando un papel preponderante en los habitos sociales de ocio propios de esta etapa madurativa. Prueba de esta circunstancia son los elevados porcentajes de consumo habitual y la temprana edad de inicio en la adquisicion del habito tanto en varones como en mujeres Las conclusiones mas destacadas de la presente tesis doctoral senalan que los niveles de condicion fisica relacionada con la salud de los adolescentes suponen uno de los factores que mayor importancia poseen como elemento disuasorio del consumo de alcohol. En nuestra investigacion hemos constatado que la practica regular y sistematica de actividad fisico-deportiva se relaciona de forma directa con un aumento en los niveles de condicion fisica y coordinativa de los sujetos. Por tal circunstancia, los adolescentes que realizan actividad fisico-deportiva consumen de forma significativa menos alcohol que aquellos que no la realizan. Del mismo modo, aquellos adolescentes que realizan una practica fisico-deportiva organizada y sistematica suelen estar dirigidos por tecnicos deportivos que les inculcan habitos saludables y les alejan del consumo de sustancias toxicas.",

In certain types of users, this dosage may remain constant in small quantities for years.

      "abstract": "In modern life, people are always troubled by various stresses, and many people think that smoking is a good way to relieve stress, so whenever they feel tired or encounter difficulties, they choose to smoke to relieve stress. It is one of the major public health issues worldwide. People are more likely to develop various cancers as the amount of cigarettes they smoke increases. Smoking affects our respiratory system (chronic bronchitis, emphysema), digestive system (overproduction of gastric juice and saliva), and nervous system (mental decline, stroke). Over the past two decades, a series of measures have been taken at the national and scientific levels to address the impact of smoking on human health. In 2004, scientists developed e-cigarettes as an alternative to traditional cigarettes. Later, at the biological level, scientists conducted research on drug treatment and reducing the nicotine content of tobacco leaves, and both made significant discoveries.",

There is usually no history of antecedent illness or predisposing cause. The parents will state that the child has a most uncertain appetite, and, in fact, at times will eat so little that it is a wonder that he can exist.

      "abstract": "You need to ensure that you are not mistaking haemoptysis with: • Haematemesis: brownish-red blood that is vomited from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. • Epistaxis (nosebleed): particularly a posterior nosebleed. • Bleeding gums: combined with a cough, this may be confused with true haemoptysis. To tell if it is really haemoptysis, you can ask the patient where they think the blood is coming from (they may say it initially dripped from their nose), its colour (darker, coffee-ground appearance suggests partially digested blood), any history of nosebleeds, nausea, vomiting, gastric disease, or alcoholism. For the latter, asking if he is an alcoholic is unlikely to yield a valid response. Instead, you can try the TACE questions to detect alcohol dependence: . . . Does it Take more than three drinks to make you feel high? Have you ever been Annoyed by people’s criticism of your drinking? Are you trying to Cut down on drinking? Have you ever used alcohol as an Eye-opener in the morning? A positive response to the first question scores 2 points and a positive response to each of the rest, scores 1 point each. A positive response to two of these four questions is considered to indicate possible alcohol abuse or dependence as does a total score of two or more points. Haemoptysis should always be investigated thoroughly for two reasons: 1 It may be the presenting symptom for life-threatening lung disease. 2 Massive haemoptysis, variably defined as anything from &gt;100 mL to &gt;1000 mL over 24 hours, may be life-threatening itself, usually through asphyxiation but potentially also shock. Haemoptysis is thus a ‘red flag’ symptom and any patient with haemoptysis requires a thorough diagnostic work-up. These can be grouped together under a ‘surgical sieve’—we have used INVITED MD: Infective: pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), bronchitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, mycetoma Neoplastic: primary lung cancer, metastatic lung cancer Vascular: pulmonary embolism, left ventricular failure, bleeding diathesis (i.e. a bleeding tendency e.g. coagulopathy, severe thrombocytopenia), arteriovenous malformation, vascular–bronchial fistula Inflammatory: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener’s granulomatosis), Goodpasture’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome), polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis",

This paper is not about the question whether addiction \"exists\" and is a disease. It departs from the widely held belief that (a loosely defined notion of) addiction is a serious problem and should be adressed by governments at many levels. Two (of many) examples: in commercial advertisements addiction is sometimes used to enhance the attractiveness of certain products. Politicians often react to questions about problems connected to drug use in general, and even to questions on specific issues such as recreative drug use, by saying something about the threat of addiction, thus switching to an area where at least some widely accepted ideas exist about the needed approach, and avoiding areas of contention.",

      "abstract": "Risky drinking seems to be very popular among young people in Europe. The presentation will discuss if primary care physicians might play some role in preventing alcohol-related harm such as severe intoxications, accidents, injuries, violence, risky sexual behaviour, depression, suicidal tendencies, progression to dependency, or impairment of developmental processes. Adolescents’ stated reasons for consuming alcohol appear to be very similar to those adults give—a tradition of drinking in their region or country, sociability, relaxation, testing out limits and pleasure. Most young people are mainly experimenting or occasionally consuming alcohol, generally learning an appropriate mastery of alcohol consumption between middle to late adolescence and young adulthood. Some young people, however, drink to cope with psychological distress, to forget problems, for example in families, schools or other relationships and are at risk of becoming long-term, large-scale consumers developing misuse and dependency, especially when “binge-drinking”. In primary care institutions young people are rarely, if at all, and mostly superficially asked about their alcohol use, although primary care physicians are in a unique position to offer low-threshold support for many everyday lifestyle-related problems. Main barriers to screening and counselling are insufficient time and lack of training in effective communication. The presentation will give some hints on easily applicable techniques that allow access to those young people who are at risk of developing alcohol use disorders and are in need of support.",

      "title": "Nicotine: From plants to people",
      "abstract": "Nicotine is naturally present in many crops, including but not limited to tobacco, eggplant, and tomatoes. Only in the tobacco plant is nicotine present in high enough quantities (~2% of dry weight) to have pharmacological effects. People have recognized the stimulating effects of the smoke created by burning dried tobacco leaves for thousands of years, and cigarette smoking remains the most common form of nicotine uptake from tobacco. Decades of epidemiologic data show that smoking causes a number of serious diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Undoubtedly, the best way to avoid the harm from smoking is to never start. For current smokers, quitting smoking altogether is the most effective way to reduce the risk of harm and smoking-related disease. Along with other aspects such as taste and ritual, nicotine is one of the reasons people smoke. Nicotine, while addictive and not risk-free, is not the primary cause of smoking-related diseases. Indeed, experts agree that smoking-related diseases are caused primarily by chronic exposure to the harmful constituents that are produced when tobacco is burning. Nevertheless, many people still mistakenly believe that nicotine is a major cause of tobacco-related diseases. While nicotine-containing products should not be used by certain groups of people - such as minors, people with or at risk of heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, or seizure, pregnant or breast-feeding women or women who think they may be pregnant - delivery of nicotine by less harmful means can support public health goals by encouraging smokers who would otherwise continue smoking to switch to less harmful products. It is, therefore, pivotal to address the biggest misconceptions about nicotine to empower smokers to make informed decisions. In this article, we discuss basic facts about nicotine, its effects on the human body, as well as the risks related to nicotine consumption.",

      "abstract": "1. introduccion o motivacion de la tesis\nEl consumo de alcohol y tabaco esta presente en la etapa de la universidad, siendo las drogas que mas se consumen entre los jovenes en Espana. Es en el rango de edad entre 15-24 anos donde se encuentra mayor consumo de alcohol y tabaco, y mayor consumo de riesgo, coincidiendo con el rango de edad mayoritario en universitarios. La universidad es una etapa en la que muchos estudiantes tienen su primer contacto con estas drogas legales.\nEl alcohol y tabaco son drogas que estan arraigadas en la sociedad espanola, puesto que forman parte de acontecimientos y celebraciones, al igual que ocurre en la universidad, donde estas estan presentes a la hora de socializar y reunirse con otros universitarios, reuniones en las que el consumo de alcohol se da de una forma intensiva, de tipo binge drinking, los fines de semana.\nPor otro lado, en esta etapa se adquieren o se fortalecen ciertos habitos que con el paso del tiempo son complicados de modificar. Por lo que es fundamental adquirir unos habitos saludables, tanto en alimentacion, como actividad fisica y/o comportamiento sexual, para que asi perduren en las demas etapas de la vida. Por otra parte, los habitos saludables se pueden considerar como una proteccion frente a la adquisicion de habitos nocivos, en este estudio el consumo de alcohol y tabaco.\nTodo lo expuesto llevo a preguntarse ?Como es el consumo de alcohol y tabaco en universitarios?, ?Que habitos en relacion a la alimentacion, actividad fisica y comportamiento sexual tienen los estudiantes?, ?Existe una relacion entre estos habitos saludables y habitos nocivos? Asi mismo, dados los horarios que frecuentan los universitarios tambien surgen las preguntas ?Que cronotipo tienen los estudiantes?, y ?En que influye en sus habitos?\n\n2.contenido de la investigacion\nDiseno: Estudio de tipo descriptivo observacional comparativo.\nSujetos y ambito de estudio: Estudiantes universitarios de las Universidades de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha (Espana). El estudio se planteo para abarcar la totalidad de estudiantes de ambas universidades. Criterios de inclusion: alumnos matriculados en las Universidades de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha en estudios de Grado, Master y Doctorado. Participaron un total de 464 estudiantes, de los cuales se excluyeron 7 por cuestionarios incompletos. Reclutando finalmente una muestra de 457 alumnos.\nVariables del estudio: variables sociodemograficas, consumo de alcohol, consumo de tabaco, actividad fisica y deportiva, habitos alimenticios, comportamiento sexual y cronotipo.\nInstrumentos: Se utilizo un cuestionario que recogia datos sociodemograficos, asi como los cuestionarios especificos de las variables a estudio: el cuestionario Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) de Saunders et al. (1993) version en espanol por Guillamon et al. (1999); el Test de Dependencia a la Nicotina de Fagerstrom (1978) version de Becona et al. (1992), Test de Richmond (1993) version de Cordoba et al (2000), International Physical Activity Questionnarie (IPAQ-SF) Craig et al (2003), Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (Kidmed) Serra-Majem et al. (2004), la Encuesta Revisada de Opinion Sexual (EROS) de del Rio Olvera et al. (2013), y Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire de Adan y Almirall (1990).\nAnalisis de datos: el analisis estadistico se realizo con el programa IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. El analisis estadistico consistio en un analisis descriptivo mediante el calculo de recuentos (n) y proporciones (%) para las variables cualitativas y mediante el calculo de media (m) y desviacion estandar (DE) para variables cuantitativas. Tambien se realizo una comparacion de proporciones de las variables categoricas mediante pruebas ji-cuadrado para tablas de contingencia. Ademas, se realizo una regresion logistica multiple para identificar las variables asociadas al consumo de alcohol, tabaco, ejercicio fisico, adherencia a la dieta mediterranea, comportamiento sexual y cronotipo.\nConsideraciones eticas: El proyecto se presento al Comite de Etica de la investigacion de la provincia de Cordoba (Acta No 269, ref. 3640), Cumplimiento de la ley organica 15/1999, de 13 de diciembre, de Proteccion de datos, de caracter personal, del Estado Espanol. Normativa vigente en el periodo de estudio. El link de acceso al cuestionario presentaba al inicio el informe del Comite de Etica y la Hoja de Informacion y Consentimiento Informado.\nResultados: Los universitarios, estudiantes tanto de la Universidad de Cordoba (UCO) como de la Universidad de Castilla La Mancha (UCLM) tienen un consumo de alcohol de riesgo el 29,5%, dandose con mayor frecuencia en mujeres y en la UCLM. El 27,6% consume tabaco, teniendo baja dependencia el 78,6%, y la mitad de los estudiantes presentan motivacion para dejar de fumar.\nEl 52,5% de estudiantes practica actividad fisica de nivel alto, destacando este nivel en el genero masculino.\nCon respecto a la dieta mediterranea, el 37% presenta adherencia alta, en relacion al comportamiento sexual se muestra una tendencia hacia la erotofilia. Sobre el cronotipo en universitarios, tras el cronotipo intermedio, la predisposicion de los universitarios es de tipo vespertino (20,7%), destacando el sexo masculino en la vespertinidad.\nComparando las variables estudiadas, los consumidores de alcohol de riesgo tienen mayor dependencia a la nicotina, consumo de tipo binge drinking, se decantan por el cronotipo vespertino, mayor grado de erotofilia y practican actividad fisica de nivel alto. La dependencia a la nicotina y el consumo de tipo binge drinking se relaciona con la erotofilia. El cronotipo matutino se vincula con mayor adherencia alta a la dieta mediterranea.\n 3.conclusion Los datos obtenidos parecen indicar que los universitarios de la Universidad de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha tienen un alto consumo de riesgo, con un consumo de tipo binge drinking, baja dependencia a la nicotina y alta motivacion para dejar de fumar. La practica de actividad fisica es de nivel alto y tienen alta adherencia a la DM. Opinion y actitud sexual de erotofilia, y cronotipo vespertino en su mayoria. Por otra parte, se relaciona el consumo de riesgo con mayor dependencia a la nicotina, consumo binge drinking, y vespertinidad. El consumo intensivo de alcohol y la dependencia a la nicotina se relacionan con mayor erotofilia, y la matutinidad se relaciona con alta adherencia a la dieta mediterranea.\n 4. bibliografia\n1.

      "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic disease with several commonalities with smoking. A review of the factors that influence compliance with smoking cessation methods may therefore suggest considerations relevant for the treatment of asthma. Many factors influence whether a smoker will decide to seek help and thus become a patient. However, once this hurdle is overcome a different set of factors influence compliance and whether the treatment is successful. Most successful quitters use individual methods rather than organized smoking cessation programmes. The most important predictive factors for whether a smoker will be successful in quitting smoking are socioeconomic rather than disease specific and this is the case whether health support services are available or not. Smokers who use nicotine replacement products are approximately twice as likely to be successful in quitting than nonusers. While the rate of nicotine absorption from these products is important, it is not the primary predictor of successful quitting. Other important factors include: self-control of nicotine dose, the skills required to use the product, and the side-effects. However, the relative importance of these factors is not well understood. An individual's perception of the appropriateness of a particular treatment and which treatment they think that they will prefer are also important in successful smoking cessation.",

      "abstract": "A case is presented in which the abuse of anabolic steroids by a body builder led to an unusual physical sign. The case discusses the effects that anabolic steroid abuse can have upon manhood. The frequency of anabolic steroid misuse is increasing. The implications of this with respect to psychiatric illness and violent crime are discussed. It is well known that the use of anabolic steroids among young men, body builders in particular, is growing apace (Perry and Littlepage, 1992), and they may be aware of the risks of impurity and contamination. There is a wide range of anabolic steroids in use; they are often used in doses of greater than 1 mg/kg per day. As well as single use, the misuser may 'stack' (use more than one at a time) or 'pyramid' (use increasing doses of a given drug) the steroids (Kennedy, 1990). The physical and psychiatric effects of anabolic steroids are well known (Kashkin and Kleber, 1989; Brower, 1992; Pope and Katz, 1988). However, we describe a case with psychiatric symptoms, a violent outburst and a unique (?) physical sign.",

      "abstract": "While a patient may appear to be fully compliant with respect to quantity of medication ingested, the timing of doses can vary considerably. This may introduce protracted intervals between doses, particularly if dosing frequency is greater than once daily. This commonly presents in the form of drug holidays, where dosing is omitted for 1 or more days, followed by a resumption of full-strength dosing, possibly resulting in excessive drug effects when dosing suddenly resumes, rebound effects when dosing is suddenly stopped and a period without effective drug action. Poor compliance has not only been associated with poorer treatment outcome, but also with financial consequences. It has been suggested that hospitalization due to non-compliance accounts for 11.7% of all healthcare expenditure in the U.S.A. Differences between drugs, in terms of both their concentration-time profiles and their duration of action, will lead to some agents being more effective than others in the face of interruptions in dosage. A drug with an intrinsically long duration of action, such as the calcium antagonist amlodipine, will provide better therapeutic coverage than those with a shorter duration of action and therefore minimize effects generated by an intermittent pattern of dosing.",

Drug use is linked neither to emotional distress nor acculturation stress.

      "abstract": "The world in which we live sets us in a reality fuelled by the existence of a large variety of psychogenic substances. The temptation of drugs has been verified since ancient times in the human society. The classical definition of drugs is established by the World Health Organization as substances which, once absorbed by a living organism, can alter one or more of its functions. Currently, \"drug\" can be understood as any substance that leads to psychoactive effects that favour the repetition of consumption due to the installation of the state of pleasure, which is considered to be motivated by the consumer. The consequences of non-management of psychoactive substances lead to the establishment of a degrading physical, psychological condition, namely addiction. Drug consumption among adolescents has several particular aspects due to the lack of fully defined personality traits, which can lead to increased vulnerability of children and adolescents due to the negative socio-familial climate. The present work presents the theme of psychoactive substances and its effects drug use among young people aged between 16 and 22 years. The motives that lead young people to drug use, the environment in which they perceive that drug use is frequent, and the way young people are aware of the effects of drug use on people who consume it have been followed. The methodology used to achieve the purpose of this paper is the questionnaire applied to a total of 30 young people, and the answers received are the result of this investigation.",

General practitioners were often unaware that elderly patients lived alone, or that they drank alcohol or drove—even when they were taking prescribed medicines for which drinking or driving were contraindicated. Just over a third of elderly people were taking prescribed medicines of which their general practitioners were apparently unaware. The way doctors prescribe for their elderly patients and supervise this prescribing is suggested as a suitable field for audit. The completeness of their records in relation to prescriptions, drinking, driving, and living alone is another possible area for study.

      "title": "Psychopharmacology of smoking cessation in patients with mental illness",
      "abstract": "A 48-year-old male smoker (35 cigarettes a day for 30 years) with major depressive disorder stabilized on citalopram, 40 mg once daily, wished to quit smoking. Whenever he quit “cold turkey,” he relapsed owing to intolerable anxiety and depression that twice met criteria for an acute depressive episode. His psychiatrist added bupropion SR, 150 mg twice daily. He was advised to quit within 2 weeks. His anxiety increased within a few days of quitting but resolved with a reduction in caffeine consumption. He discontinued bupropion after 12 months. He gained 1 kg, remained euthymic and had occasional mild cravings with minimal anxiety.\r\n\r\nTobacco causes almost 48 000 premature deaths in Canada annually (Makomaski and Kaiserman, Can J Public Health 2004;95:38-44). Those with past-month psychiatric diagnoses consume 44% of all cigarettes (Lasser et al, JAMA 2000;284:2606-10). This significant association is due to a combination of genetic (e.g., P50 deficits in schizophrenia corrected by nicotine), environmental (e.g., pro-smoking policies in patient group homes) and other factors (e.g., “self-medicating behaviours” to reduce anxiety and depression; the use of cigarettes as rewards to shape behaviour). The adverse effects are amplified by obesity and metabolic changes owing to psychotropic drugs and poverty. Fortunately, there is a 50% risk reduction in coronary events within 1 year of quitting and a significant reduction in the risk of developing lung disease and cancer in the long-term.\r\n\r\nBupropion has a large effect size in permanent smoking cessation (19 trials, odds ratio 2.06, 95% confidence interval 1.77–2.40) independent of its antidepressant effects (Hughes et al, Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2004;[4]:{type:entrez-nucleotide,attrs:{text:C31,term_id:30294550,term_text:C31}}C31), with 15% quitting permanently with minimal weight gain. It is also effective in smokers with depression and schizophrenia (Dudas and George, Essent Psychopharmacol 2005;6:158-72). Bupropion may stabilize the dopaminergic reward system and competitively antagonize nicotine at central α4β2 nicotinic receptors (Warner and Shoaib, Addict Biol 2005;10:219-31). Clinically, subjects report decreased cravings and cigarette taste aversion. Responders tend to be moderately dependent male smokers who have tried to quit previously (Hurt et al, Addict Behav 2002;27:493-507). Smokers with the low activity variant (CT/TT group) of CYP2B6 are less likely to be abstinent than are smokers with normal activity variants (CC group) (χ2 = 5.0, p < 0.02) (Munafo et al, Pharmacogenomics 2005; 6:211-23). Bupropion is safe in combination with most neurotropic drugs because it is primarily metabolized by CYP 2B6. However, dose reduction in concomitant caffeine, benzodiazepines and neuroleptic drugs (especially clozapine) may be warranted, because polyaromatic hydrocarbons present in smoke induce CYP 1A2. The induction reverses within days to weeks after smoking cessation.\r\n\r\nDoses of 150 mg or 300 mg are effective within 3 weeks, but there are no studies with higher doses. Motivated smokers may also respond after 4 weeks of therapy. Thereafter, nicotine replacement therapy may be added. Relapse is common on stopping the medication, even after a year, necessitating longer-term use in some smokers (Hays et al, Ann Intern Med 2001;135:423-33).\r\n\r\nInsomnia can be minimized by timing the second dose to be no later than 6 hours before bed. Seizures (1/2000) can be prevented by not exceeding the recommended dose and by observing contraindications.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, psychiatrists have the ability to treat smokers in their practice with a common psychiatric medication with good efficacy.\r\n\r\nPeter Selby, MBBS, CCFP, FASAM Addictions Program Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Departments of Family and Community Medicine, Psychiatry and Public Health Sciences University of Toronto Toronto, Ont.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes: Are we renormalizing public smoking? Reversing five decades of tobacco control and revitalizing nicotine dependency in children and youth in Canada",
      "abstract": "An electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) is a battery attached to a chamber containing liquid that may (or may not) contain nicotine. The battery heats the liquid and converts it into a vapour, which is inhaled, mimicking tobacco smoking. The e-cigarette does not rely on tobacco as a source of nicotine but, rather, vaporizes a liquid for inhalation. E-liquids are often flavoured and may contain nicotine in various concentrations, although actual amounts are seldom accurately reflected in container labelling. The deleterious effects of nicotine on paediatric health are well established. The use of e-cigarettes in the paediatric age group is on the rise in Canada, as are associated nicotine poisonings. E-devices generate substantial amounts of fine particulate matter, toxins and heavy metals at levels that can exceed those observed for conventional cigarettes. Children and youth are particularly susceptible to these atomized products. Action must be taken before these devices become a more established public health hazard. Policies to denormalize tobacco smoking in society and historic reductions in tobacco consumption may be undermined by this new 'gateway' product to nicotine dependency. La cigarette électronique (vapoteuse) est une batterie fixée à un réservoir rempli d’un liquide qui peut (ou non) contenir de la nicotine. La batterie réchauffe le liquide et le convertit en vapeur, qui est inhalée afin d’imiter le tabagisme. La source de nicotine de la vapoteuse ne provient pas du tabac, mais le dispositif vaporise un liquide en vue de son inhalation. Ces e-liquides, souvent aromatisés, peuvent contenir de la nicotine sous diverses concentrations, mais leur quantité réelle est rarement bien indiquée sur l’emballage. Les effets délétères de la nicotine sur la santé sont bien établis dans le groupe d’âge pédiatrique. Le vapotage est en hausse au sein de ce groupe au Canada, de même que les intoxications à la nicotine qui y sont associées. Les vapoteuses produisent de grandes quantités de particules fines, de toxines et de métaux lourds, à des taux qui peuvent dépasser ceux de la cigarette conventionnelle. Les enfants et les adolescents sont particulièrement susceptibles à ces produits atomisés. Il faut agir avant que ces dispositifs deviennent un danger mieux établi en santé publique. Cette nouvelle « porte d’accès » à la dépendance à la nicotine pourrait saboter les politiques visant à « dénormaliser » le tabagisme dans la société, ainsi que les réductions historiques de consommation du tabac.",

      "title": "Smoked Marijuana as a Cause of Lung Injury",
      "abstract": "In many societies, marijuana is the second most commonly smoked substance after tobacco. While delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is unique to marijuana and nicotine to tobacco, the smoke of marijuana, like that of tobacco, consists of a toxic mixture of gases and particulates, many of which are known to be harmful to the lung. Although far fewer marijuana than tobacco cigarettes are generally smoked on a daily basis, the pulmonary consequences of marijuana smoking may be magnified by the greater deposition of smoke particulates in the lung due to the differing manner in which marijuana is smoked. Whereas THC causes modest short-term bronchodilation, regular marijuana smoking produces a number of long-term pulmonary consequences, including chronic cough and sputum, histopathologic evidence of widespread airway inflammation and injury and immunohistochemical evidence of dysregulated growth of respiratory epithelial cells, that may be precursors to lung cancer. The THC in marijuana could contribute to some of these injurious changes through its ability to augment oxidative stress, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibit apoptosis. On the other hand, physiologic, clinical or epidemiologic evidence that marijuana smoking may lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or respiratory cancer is limited and inconsistent. Habitual use of marijuana is also associated with abnormalities in the structure and function of alveolar macrophages, including impairment in microbial phagocytosis and killing that is associated with defective production of immunostimulatory cytokines and nitric oxide, thereby potentially predisposing to pulmonary infection. In view of the growing interest in medicinal marijuana, further epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify the true risks of regular marijuana smoking on respiratory health.",

      "abstract": "La adiccion a cocaina es un fenomeno de gran importancia clinica y social. Las consecuencias negativas que produce el abuso de estas sustancias son significativas, incluyendo problemas medicos, psicosociales y laborales para los individuos afectados. Ademas, su abuso esta asociado a tasas incrementadas de crimen y violencia. La dependencia se caracteriza por tasas elevadas de recaida en un patron ciclico de busqueda y consumo. Estas recaidas pueden producirse incluso despues de periodos prolongados de abstinencia. Dadas estas premisas, uno de los principales objetivos de nuestro trabajo es la identificacion de farmacos que puedan atenuar el deseo compulsivo (“craving”) de consumir y reducir la incidencia de recaidas en animales experimentales. Ademas de mitigar el craving, estos farmacos deberian poseer un escaso o nulo potencial de abuso y carecer de los fuertes efectos psicoestimulantes caracteristicos de estas drogas. La busqueda de nuevas medicaciones para el tratamiento de la adiccion se ha centrado en la identificacion de sustancias que actuen como sustitutos de la droga estimulante produciendo efectos similares en la transmision dopaminergica y/o ejerciendo acciones antagonistas que impidan la union al transportador de dopamina. La mayoria de los esfuerzos se han centrado en el diseno de moleculas que mimeticen la union al transportador pero con un menor efecto estimulante y una accion farmacologica mas duradera. Los estudios presentados han caracterizado el potencial de abuso y e terapeutico de dos analogos derivados de la benzotropina (BZT), el AHN 1-055 y el JHW 007. Estas moleculas se caracterizan por tener una alta afinidad por el DAT y una pauta lenta y duradera de accion farmacologica. Para llevar a cabo el trabajo administramos cada uno de los analogos en combinacion con cocaina o anfetamina empleando diferentes modelos animales de adiccion a psicoestimulantes tales como actividad locomotora, sensibilizacion, preferencia de lugar condicionada (CPP) y autoadministracion (SA), acompanados de tecnicas de Western blot. Los resultados de estos ensayos han mostrado que ambos analogos no se comportan como estimulantes clasicos, mostrando significativamente menor capacidad estimulante a la vez que atenuan o bloquean completamente algunos de los efectos, tanto comportamentales como neurobiologicos inducidos tanto por los psicoestimulantes. Ademas, se muestran evidencias de que el tratamiento sustitutivo con el AHN-1055 como reduce la vulnerabilidad de recaida en individuos consumidores, apoyando la hipotesis de que pueden ser moleculas apropiadas para el tratamiento de la adiccion a los psicoestimulantes.",

Increasing numbers of young people abroad are experimenting with e-cigarettes but no trend data for the Netherlands are available to date. Young people who experiment with e-cigarettes are principally those young people who already smoke conventional cigarettes or have done so in the past; the same applies to adults. There are no indications that experimenting with e-cigarettes can lead to tobacco addiction. Although the vapour from e-cigarettes contains substances that are harmful to health, the health risks from the use of e-cigarettes are far smaller than those from smoking conventional cigarettes. Too few research data are available to be able to conclude that e-cigarettes are an effective aid to smoking cessation.",

      "abstract": "The use of e-cigarettes has dramatically increased over the past few years and their role in smoking cessation remains controversial. Several clinical studies have evaluated their efficacy in smoking cessation but most of them are prospective cohort studies. Only two randomized, controlled trials have compared e-cigarettes versus placebo or patches. A meta-analysis of these two randomized, controlled trials has been performed. Nicotine-containing e-cigarettes appear to help smokers unable to stop smoking altogether to reduce their cigarette consumption when compared with placebo. However, these results are rated ‘low’ by GRADE standards. Many cohort studies have been conducted, with contradictory results. For some, e-cigarettes could increase the risk of nonsmokers developing nicotine dependence and of current smokers maintaining their dependence. The debate remains open and more randomized trials are needed with long-term data about the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes.",

In parts of India, for example, holy men smoke cannabis to quell their appetite for food and sex; in the West, the same drug is successfully used to enhance precisely the same appetites.

While the relationship is the same today as it was in the past, the pervasiveness of the association, and the consequences, are more dramatic. There are two ways in which substance abuse is related to violence. First, violence can be and is perpetrated under the influence of substances, and second, violence related to substance abuse stems from the trade in drugs, which is all too often focused in poor and underserved communities. The elimination of the market for drugs, and thus the reduction in the demand for drugs, will bring about a reduction in substance abuse-related violence.",

Despite their extensive medical use, the evidence suggests they are ineffective or minimally effective in most of the conditions for which they are prescribed. Their widespread use in medical practice is more likely the result of the euphoria and the dependence they induce than of any significant clinical results. This paradox, presented by the legality of amphetamine use, compounds the difficulty of treating youthful drug abusers and educating potential abusers. The following recommendations are urged: prescription of these drugs should, with few exceptions, cease; and production should be sharply curtailed and probably be limited to one or two pharmaceutical companies.",

Smoking increases a person’s risk for diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Associated with these increased risks for disease is a shortened lifespan in smokers. Research has also shown that cigarette smoking alters the body’s response to exercise. Nicotine and carbon monoxide are two compounds in cigarette smoke that may affect cardiorespiratory function, thereby modifying the body’s exercise response. Additionally, research has shown that compared to nonsmokers, smokers demonstrate a greater reliance on glucose as a fuel source during exercise. A focus of this review is on the cigarette smoke compounds nicotine and carbon monoxide and the mechanisms by which these compounds affect the human body. Also addressed are the physiological effects of cigarette smoking on exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, and substrate utilization.",

A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance affects the activity of a drug, i.e. the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce a new effect that neither produces on its own. These interactions may occur out of accidental misuse or due to lack of knowledge about the active ingredients involved in the relevant substances. Regarding food-drug interactions physicians and pharmacists recognize that some foods and drugs, when taken simultaneously, can alter the body's ability to utilize a particular food or drug, or cause serious side effects. Clinically significant drug interactions, which pose potential harm to the patient, may result from changes in pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic properties. Some may be taken advantage of, to the benefit of patients, but more commonly drug interactions result in adverse drug events. Therefore it is advisable for patients to follow the physician and doctors instructions to obtain maximum benefits with least food-drug interactions. The literature survey was conducted by extracting data from different review and original articles on general or specific drug interactions with food. This review gives information about various interactions between different foods and drugs and will help physicians and pharmacists prescribe drugs cautiously with only suitable food supplement to get maximum benefit for the patient.",

      "title": "The health effects of cannabis: Key issues of policy relevance",
      "abstract": "Cannabis remains one of the most widely abused drugs worldwide, with a substantial number of users in many Western societies. Epidemiological studies reveal that most users are young individuals either in their teens or early twenties. The most prevalent pattern of use is intermittent. Traditional use of cannabis is also prevalent in many countries. The main acute adverse effects of cannabis are cognitive impairment, especially of attention and memory, psychomotor impairment, and a possible increased risk of traffic accidents. The main physical and psychological health effects of chronic, heavy cannabis use, especially daily use, over many years, are most commonly respiratory disease, dependence and subtle cognitive impairment. It is estimated that approximately 10 per cent of persons who try cannabis progress to daily use, with a further 20 to 30 per cent using it on a weekly basis. Cannabis use during pregnancy is likely to result in shortened gestation and low-birth-weight babies. Other potential dangers of chronic heavy use that remain to be confirmed include an increased risk of developing cancer, a decline in occupational performance, impaired educational attainment in adolescents and birth defects. While it is known that underachieving adolescents are more likely to smoke cannabis, a cause-effect relationship has not been established. There is considerable anecdotal information regarding the therapeutic usefulness of smoking cannabis. In recent times, the most intense interest has been directed towards the prevention of weight loss in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), although management of pain, prevention of emesis and control of glaucoma and movement disorders still command attention. Of these potential uses, treatment of cachexia in AIDS patients and of chronic pain seems most worthy of scientific validation. Efforts to develop synthetic cannabinoid derivatives should remain a primary goal for treatment of most such disorders. The discovery of an endogenous cannabinoid system provides a means not only of developing new therapeutic agents but also of establishing the biological consequences of long-term cannabis exposure on the brain. The localization of cannabinoid receptors in brain areas associated with some of the most prominent pharmacological effects of cannabis, that is, cognition, pain perception and movement, provides an insight into the physiological importance of those receptors. The identification of anandamide, the endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptor, provided credence for a naturally occurring endogenous cannabinoid system in the brain. This endogenous system adapts to chronic exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by a reduction in the number of receptors, the physiological consequence of which remains to be established.",

Synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Cessation after regular use may result in drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness. Metabolites of THC can be detected in the urine up to 1 month after last use; some medications can cause false-positive tests. Serious medical complications of cannabis use are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users and acute cognitive and motor impairment.

      "title": "Abstract CN02-03: Quitting or switching? Health benefits and risk of electronic cigarettes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although the best way for smokers to avoid the health risks associated with smoking is to quit smoking altogether, for those who do continue to smoke the application of an exposure reduction (“harm reduction”) strategy could result in substantial reductions in mortality and morbidity. Many smokers are concerned about the health effects of smoking and might be interested in trying new products if they believed this would reduce their health risk. The concept of exposure reduction is based on the principle that if dangerous behavior, like smoking, is likely to continue, the harm caused should be minimized. One such approach for continuing smokers would be to promote the substitution of alternative, less toxic means of delivering nicotine, assuming that these were proven to be less hazardous than tobacco smoking and did not cause any additional health risks. Electronic nicotine inhalers, commonly called electronic cigarettes or “e-cigarettes”, represent a new stage in which nicotine is delivered in a method that simulates smoking but without involving a tobacco combustion process. E-cigarette are battery-powered devices that provide inhaled doses of nicotine by delivering a vaporized liquid nicotine solution, usually including propylene glycol or glycerin. The nicotine is extracted from tobacco leaves (in the same way the pharmaceutical industry obtains nicotine for NRT production), and is then diluted and introduced into the e-cigarette's cartridge. In addition to delivering nicotine, the vapor also provides a flavor and physical sensation similar to that of inhaled tobacco smoke, although no tobacco or combustion is actually involved in its operation. When a user initiates inhalation into the device, air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the nicotine solution stored in the mouthpiece cartridge. It is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. On some models an LED on the opposite end of the device is activated during inhalation to serve as an indicator of use as well as simulating the glow of burning tobacco. E-cigarettes have been shown to reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms in abstinent smokers and, as nicotine is delivered without tobacco combustion, are thought to be substantially safer than cigarettes. While e-cigarette use is rapidly increasing, relatively little is known about their efficacy for smoking cessation, particularly compared with established nicotine-containing pharmacological aids. One randomized controlled trial by Bullen et al. showed that e-cigarettes are at least as effective as nicotine patches for smoking cessation. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of participants in this study engaged in harm reduction, becoming long-term e-cigarette users and reducing their conventional cigarette consumption. Thus, against the backdrop of ongoing debates on tighter regulation of e-cigarettes, a sole focus on smoking cessation may be misguided. From a public health perspective, the permanent switch from combustible to noncombustible products is an important endpoint in itself. Nonetheless, the finding that e-cigarettes are at least as effective as existing licensed, nicotine-containing smoking cessation products should go some way towards easing, if not completely allaying, the fears of many health professionals observing their fast uptake among smokers. Distributors of e-cigarettes promote the product as completely free of harmful substances. However, nicotine solutions used in e-cigarettes vary with respect to concentrations of toxicants, and the quality control in e cigarette manufacturing is questionable. Although a number of toxicants have been identified in e-cigarette vapors, the levels of these toxicants are orders of magnitude lower than those found in cigarette smoke, but higher than those found in Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products. Some studies suggest that vapor from e-cigarette is significantly less cytotoxic compared to tobacco smoke. One study found that after switching from tobacco to electronic cigarettes nicotine exposure is unchanged while exposure to selected toxicants is substantially reduced. Although it cannot be said that currently marketed e-cigarettes are safe, e-cigarette vapor is likely to be much less toxic than cigarette smoke. The devices likely pose less direct hazard to the individual smoker than tobacco cigarettes and might help smokers quit smoking or reduce harm by smoking fewer cigarettes. The use of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy among cigarette smokers who are unable to quit, warrants further studies. Further research is needed to evaluate long term effects of switching, including the health effects of continued use of e-cigarettes. Citation Format: Maciej Lukasz Goniewicz. Quitting or switching?

      "title": "Smoking cessation: the psychiatrist's role.",
      "abstract": "Although tobacco use is one of the leading preventable causes of death and the prevalence of smoking in persons with psychiatric disorders is very high, psychiatrists may be missing opportunities to assist patients to stop smoking, perhaps because this health promotion activity is seen to be in the province of the family physician.1 We may be consulted, however, when patients with psychiatric disorders consider smoking cessation or have difficulty in achieving abstinence.\r\n\r\nA patient with bipolar disorder resolved to stop smoking after experiencing several upper respiratory infections. He was a heavy smoker with a high Fagerstrom nicotine dependence score (8).2 His mood was well stabilized by treatment with lithium carbonate, and his only other medication was atorvastatin.\r\n\r\nThe patient decided on a quit date and started to exercise regularly, to avoid smoking while away from the house and to use nicotine gum 4 mg as needed. With this strategy, his consumption went from over 30 cigarettes daily to about 10 daily; he had no problems apart from cravings for cigarettes. A couple of weeks before the quit date and wishing to further reduce his intake of cigarettes, he saw his family physician, who prescribed varenicline according to the usual schedule (0.5 mg/d initially, increasing to 2 mg/d over 1 week). After starting the varenicline, the patient developed several significant symptoms, many attributable to acute nicotine withdrawal: sadness, difficulty thinking and executing actions, poor energy, and somatic sensations including “kinks in (his) body” and burning eyes. He felt as though he had taken a pill with residual effects that included his head not being clear and an “unnatural feeling.” Cigarettes failed to relieve these symptoms, and the usual feeling of satisfaction from smoking was lacking.\r\n\r\nHe was seen in the clinic after 10 days of treatment with varenicline. It was decided that he would discontinue this medication and attempt to quit as originally planned. His mood and ability to function returned to normal about 4 days after stopping the varenicline, by which time all the symptoms mentioned above had resolved. The patient was subsequently able to stop smoking completely (at the time of writing for 3 weeks) with the aid of the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).\r\n\r\nVarenicline is a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is the main site of action of nicotine. Like NRT and bupropion, the use of varenicline increases the rate of complete smoking cessation by a factor of about 2 to 3. These pharmacologic aids are best employed in conjunction with various non pharmacologic approaches, including counselling and strategies such as making the home smoke-free and exercising regularly. Bupropion is relatively contraindicated in patients with bipolar disorder, given that it can cause mood cycling. Varenicline appears to be quite safe for use in patients with psychiatric illnesses, but there have been reports of exacerbation of schizophrenia and induction of hypomania, or even mania, following treatment with this drug.3–5\r\n\r\nSmoking cessation is a risk factor for the development of depression, but the timing of this patient's symptoms suggests a withdrawal syndrome resulting from an acute reduction in stimulation of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors after the introduction of varenicline. Occupancy of the nicotinic receptors by this high-affinity drug also accounts for the failure of smoking to relieve the symptoms or produce a positive effect.\r\n\r\nNRT, bupropion and varenicline can be used in combination, and other drugs can also be employed as aids to smoking cessation. A review of these treatments and other aspects of this important field can be found in an excellent article published in the November 2007 issue of the CMAJ6 (cited in bibliography for the online version of this column appearing on the JPN website). NRT in its various forms (patch, gum, etc.) should, in my opinion, be considered the initial drug of choice for smoking cessation, with the other drugs being reserved for cases in which NRT is not tolerated or is ineffective, particularly in patients with psychiatric comorbidity.\r\n\r\nAssisting patients to stop smoking can be highly rewarding, and the more informed we are about developments in this important field, the more effective we will be in helping our patients.\r\n\r\nNicholas J.

      "title": "Adolescent Feeding: Nutritional Risk Factors",
      "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this review is to describe adolescent nutritional requirements from a scientific, nutritional, and psychosocial point of view, emphasizing the main risks of malnutrition at this age. Currently, too many teenagers are alone at home and prepare their own meals. The influence of friends replaces parental rules. The habits of adolescents are characterized by a tendency to skip meals, especially breakfast, and, less frequently, the midday meal; to purchase carry-out meals away from home; to consume snacks, especially sweets; to eat at fast food restaurants, almost always with high-calorie content; and to eat fried foods, soft drinks, and sweets. Toxic habits, such as smoking, alcohol, and drugs, interfere with a healthy diet, as well. Physical activity usually decreases during adolescence, particularly in girls. The lack of physical activity is due to a precarious knowledge of the benefits associated with practicing physical activity, low motivation, time constraints, and, in many cases, the lack of adequate facilities. Adolescents interested in a body image in accordance with modern ideals follow restrictive and unbalanced diets without any nutritional basis, which they themselves planned. These behaviors increase the risk of nutritional alterations, such as noncompliance with nutritional requirements, meal pattern irregularities, nutritional problems due to low nutrient intake, and self-esteem issues and frustration. In general, in this age group, there is an increase in protein consumption and salt content, often with a supply of unbalanced nutrients, high-fat diets (35–50% of total calories), and low polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio. In addition, adolescents consume a low level of complex carbohydrates, fiber, fruits, and vegetables.",

This unfiltered smoke contains the same toxic components of the mainstream smoke inhaled directly by the smoker, including numerous carcinogens, many in greater concentrations. It has long been known that exposure to this type of smoke leads to increased respiratory and other adverse health conditions in non-smokers, especially children. During the past five years, evidence has been accumulating that risk of lung cancer is also higher, particularly in non-smoking women whose husbands smoke. Despite uncertainties and differences in interpretation of various cancer studies, there is ample justification for public health measures now in place or proposed, such as restriction or elimination of smoking in the workplace and in public places.",

      "abstract": "Despite the well-known health risks associated with smokeless tobacco use, much is unresolved with respect to effective treatment for use of this substance. The present study examined the impact of a nicotine-free smokeless tobacco substitute and confectionary chewing gum on craving, withdrawal, and anxiety among 24 smokeless tobacco users following 24 hours of nicotine abstinence and a laboratory stressor. Although chewing gum did not impact withdrawal, craving, or anxiety compared to a no-product control condition, smokeless tobacco substitute administration resulted in a reduction of withdrawal and craving levels compared to the control condition following 24 hours of abstinence. Furthermore, significantly lower levels of craving and withdrawal were observed in both smokeless tobacco and smokeless tobacco substitute conditions compared to the control condition following the stressor. Results indicate that although general oral stimulation (eg, chewing gum) was not effective in reducing symptoms related to nicotine withdrawal, smokeless tobacco substitute use appears to be helpful in reducing withdrawal levels post-stressor. These data suggest that use of a smokeless tobacco substitute may be an effective aid in helping individuals wishing to quit, especially when managing stressors. (Am J Addict 2010;00:1-8).",

      "title": "Risks of flavored nicotine and nicotine-free substances on adolescents",
      "abstract": "Nicotinic substances, tobacco, and vape pods have been widely used in electronic cigarettes that have been increasing in global popularity among adolescents. Global rise in electronic cigarettes and vaping devices are mainly being promoted through social media platforms such as Instagram advertisements and TikTok commercials1,2. Particularly, the inhalation (vaping) of electronic cigarettes contains toxic particles such as nicotine combined with various flavors that are delivered to the lungs and brain. Chronic vaping of toxic particles can cause addiction, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and increased risks of hypoxemia3,4. Recent commercials promote non-nicotine (0 mg) vape pods consisting of harmful particles that target adolescents to smoke electronic cigarettes and to keep up with current societal norms1,4. Ultrafine particles found in vaping products can harm vital organs such as the lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, and cause neurological dependence on flavored nicotinic substances3,4. A recent study by Smith and colleagues includes computed tomography images of the lungs when exposed to 90 days of smoking electronic cigarette particles to cause acute lung injury. The computed tomography images show ground-glass opacities associated with consolidation in the lungs that can clinically manifest as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, alveolar hemorrhage, and/or respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease3. Flavored inhalation of nicotine or nicotine-free substances increases the risks of lung injury and can cause oxidative stress in the body. A similar study by Caporale and colleagues emphasizes the toxicity of non-nicotine electronic cigarettes to impact the endothelial function of a healthy nonsmoker. Specifically, the study highlights when nonsmokers went through magnetic resonance imaging before and after inhaling nicotine-free cigarette aerosol, there was vascular resistance in the arterioles which resulted in lowering venous hemoglobin saturation that may be a result of hypoxemia. Regardless of smoking, nicotine or nicotine-free substances some microparticles can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which can cause adverse reactions such as neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity4. Therefore, limiting electronic cigarettes in the market should be implemented to promote the healthy development of adolescents. Should the government implement school classes to educate adolescents about the dangers of electronic cigarettes? The benefits of public awareness about the toxicity of vaping outweigh the potential government spending that may be required. Educating the youth about the dangers of vaping can limit its usage and can promote normal adolescent development. However, there is a rise in non-nicotine vape pods, which were originally introduced to assist chronic smokers in quitting conventional cigarettes. Now nicotine-free vape pods are being used as a stepping stone for young individuals to start vaping and potentially use products with nicotine. Some suggestions to counter the rise of vaping can be to increase the prices of electronic cigarettes, raise taxes on each purchase, increase the minimum age to buy vaping devices, and monitor social media advertisements. Another way to curb and limit the usage of nicotine vaping devices in the community is to dispense electronic cigarettes with medical prescriptions. Moreover, a common problem that educational institutions may face is the rise in social media trends that use vaping as a way for students to bond with one another. To counter this trend, institutions should ensure healthier social groups by introducing clubs such as sports, gaming, drama, art, and cooking, or promoting any gathering of students' interest that avoids inhalation or ingestion of toxic microparticles. Therefore, electronic cigarettes should be difficult to purchase for adolescents and further research is necessary on non-nicotine vaping devices and the potential pathologic problems that could cause chronic diseases or halt normal development.

Der Hauptgrund ist das natürliche Erkundungsverhalten in dieser Altersgruppe, bei dem auch fast alles mit dem Mund „untersucht“ wird. Einerseits verleitet die Gestaltung (Farbe, Form, Duft) von chemisch-technischen Erzeugnissen und Gebrauchsgegenständen zum „Kosten“. Andererseits wird das Verhalten der Erwachsenen nachgeahmt. (z.B. beim „Doktorspiel“). Eine für Kinder leicht zugängliche Lagerung der Produkte (z.B. Unterschränke in Küche, Bad und Toilette) begünstigt häufig Ingestionsunfälle. Während im Kleinkindalter Arzneimittel, Wasch-, Reinigungs- und Putzmittel, Kosmetika, Bedarfsgegenstände und Pflanzen als Unfallursache im Vordergrund stehen, wechselt das Spektrum im Schul- und Jugendalter zunehmend zu Vergiftungen mit Arzneimitteln und Drogen. In dieser Altersgruppe kommt es bereits häufiger zu (para-) suizidalen Handlungen oder auch zur missbräuchlichen Verwendung von Produkten (Treibgasinhalation). Exakte Zahlenangaben der jährlichen Vergiftungsfälle im Kindesalter fehlen, weil es keine umfassende Meldepflicht für die behandelnden Ärzte gibt. Sehr unvollständige Meldungen erhält das Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung gemäß §16 e Chemikaliengesetz über Vergiftungen mit Chemikalien und chemischen Produkten, Kosmetika, Pflanzenschutz-, Schädlingsbekämpfung- und Holzschutzmitteln sowie Umweltchemikalien. Schätzungen der deutschen Giftinformationszentren gehen von jährlich insgesamt 100.000 Fällen im Kindesalter aus, davon 10.000 Vergiftungen (10%), darunter 500 vital bedrohliche Fälle (5%) und 20 bis 40 Todesfälle (0,2–0,4%).",

Today, this concept, which was successful with illegal drugs, cannot be applied to tobacco because of a lack of proof. There is no safe cigarette and all brands have the same toxicity. Arguments in favor of smokeless tobacco are still insufficient for a public health decision. A voluntary decrease of tobacco consumption does not decrease morbidity and mortality of heavy smokers. A long-term use of nicotine replacement therapy is acceptable to reduce the daily smoking under medical supervision in smokers with chronic tobacco related disease who have previously failed in attempts to quit smoking.",

Because smoking cessation requires self-control, it was hypothesized that a treatment that builds self-control should help in quitting smoking. A total of 122 smokers either practiced small acts of self-control for 2 weeks before quitting smoking or practiced a task that increased their awareness of self-control or feelings of confidence, without exercising self-control. Their smoking status was assessed using daily telephone calls and biochemically verified. Individuals who practiced self-control remained abstinent longer than those who practiced tasks that did not require self-control. Supplemental analyses suggested that the increased survival times were a product of building self-control strength and were not produced by changes in feelings that practicing should help in cessation, effort exerted on the practice task, or thinking more about self-control while practicing.",

Despite the fact that e-cigarette has become popular in a dramatic way, there are certain differences of opinion regarding its long-term effects on health, in particular. While some people assert that it is less harmful than conventional cigarettes, some others assert the contrary. Although e-cigarette contains less toxic substances compared to conventional cigarette, it contains certain carcinogens existing in conventional cigarette such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. It also contains heavy metals (nickel, chrome) that conventional cigarette does not contain; and therefore, raises concerns about health. E-cigarette leads to upper and lower respiratory tract irritation as well as an increased airway resistance and an increased bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract. It may also cause tahcycardia and increase diastolic blood pressure. Although e-cigarette has been found to have certain benefits in terms of smoking cessation, most of the studies have shown unfavorable results. In this collected work, the effects of e-cigarette on health and its role in smoking cessation are discussed in detail.",

      "title": "Regulation in the face of uncertainty: the evidence on electronic nicotine delivery systems (e-cigarettes)",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Tobacco smoking is the largest single preventable cause of many chronic diseases and death. Effective treatments exist; however, few smokers use them and most try to quit by themselves. Most of the tobacco cigarette's toxicity is related to the combustion process. Models of harm reduction applied to tobacco suggest that switching from inhalation of combustible products to a noncombustible nicotine delivery product would likely result in a vast reduction in tobacco-related death and illness. Currently available evidence raises no doubt that electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are by far less harmful than smoking (although probably not absolutely safe) and have the potential to be the most effective tobacco harm reduction products due to their unique property of resembling smoking and providing satisfaction to the user. A lot of controversy is surrounding e-cigs and their regulation, much of which is based on the precautionary principle. Although monitoring and further research is definitely needed, the arguments used to implement severe restrictions or bans are mostly hypothetical, weakly supported by evidence, and, in some cases, derived from mispresentation or misinterpretation of the study findings. Regulators should keep in mind that the target population is smokers who want to reduce or quit their deadly tobacco consumption. To achieve this goal, smokers should be honestly informed on the relative harmfulness of the different products. E-cigs are not tobacco products and are not used as medications. For this reason, a specific regulatory scheme is needed, separate from tobacco or medicinal products regulation. Regulation should implement specific quality criteria for products, rules for the exclusion of chemicals of reasonable concern, and appropriate testing for possible contaminants. Additionally, manufacturing standards derived from the food industry should be implemented and adjusted for specific conditions related to e-cigs. Finding the appropriate balance between safety and acceptability of use by smokers will be important in achieving the maximum public health benefit. Labeling should be specified, with warnings about exposure to skin or through ingestion and discouragement of use by nonsmokers, related to the presence of nicotine. Finally, advertising and marketing should not be banned, but appropriately regulated in order to encourage use by the intended population while avoiding use by never-smokers. E-cigs should be appealing to smokers (but not to nonsmokers), while availability and pricing should be strong competitive advantages of e-cigs relative to tobacco cigarettes.

El alcohol es una de las drogas, que por su facil acceso y su poderosa propaganda que recibe, se ha convertido en un verdadero problema social en todos los paises y en todas las edades. Los estudiantes universitarios han consumido alcohol por lo menos una vez en su vida y, quiza, haya tomado de mas en alguna ocasion. Esto puede ser normal, pues que un estudiante universitario tome bebidas alcoholicas siendo caracteristico de su edad. Pero cuando el joven lo hace con frecuencia y sin medida, su vida se ve afectada en terminos de su desempeno y calidad, entonces el muchacho es un alcoholico. La problematica derivada del consumo de alcohol en los jovenes es diferente a la del adulto. En los jovenes, las consecuencias negativas derivadas del consumo de alcohol, suelen referirse a alteraciones de las relaciones con la familia, companeros y maestros, bajo rendimiento escolar, agresiones, violencias, alteraciones del orden publico y conductas de alto riesgo, como conducir tras haber bebido, asi como actividades sexuales que conllevan embarazos no deseados o enfermedades de transmision sexual. La mayoria de los estudiantes de la facultad de jurisprudencia concurren los bares cercanos a la institucion en horas de clases para consumir alcohol sin importar las consecuencias que trae este problema.",

      "title": "Electronic cigarettes use and pharmacological strategies as an intervention for tobacco cessation: Myth or reality?",
      "abstract": "Tobacco use is a single leading preventable cause of death worldwide. It contains nicotine, which is one of the most addictive psychoactive drugs; thus, successful quitting becomes a challenging process. Occupation has a profound influence on tobacco use patterns, and in the majority of scenarios, users are unable to achieve abstinence to maintain the need for the psychoactive effect of nicotine to cope up with job stresses and to remain energetic. Various tobacco cessation aids are available with variable success rates. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vaping has become popular, particularly in Western Countries and among occupational workers as they contain less harmful chemicals than combustible cigarettes and can help heavy smokers to quit the habit. Reports of short- and long-term health effects of vaping have currently led to a ban on the production, manufacturing, and advertising of e-cigarettes. Pharmacological interventions such as bupropion and varenicline have been proven to provide long-term abstinence; however, neuropsychiatric side effects limit their use. This paper focusses on the hypothesis that whether the electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) or vaping and pharmacological interventions are an effective tobacco cessation interventions.",

Aunque los habitos toxicos maternos hayan cambiado en los ultimos anos, las enfermedades observadas en fetos y neonatos no presentan diferencias. Los hijos de madres consumidoras de drogas de abuso, legales o no, estan asociados a un elevado porcentaje de prematuridad, aborto, bajo peso, sindrome de abstinencia, infecciones asociadas, problemas sociofamiliares, etc. El consumo mas habitual es el de tabaco, que aunque parece estar disminuyendo, todavia sigue siendo un problema. Existe un alto porcentaje de personas que no saben realmente que efectos pueden producir determinadas drogas. Muchos piensan que fumar un par de cigarrillos al dia no es perjudicial para el feto, asi como el tomarse una cerveza o una copa de vino al dia o en el fin de semana. Desde hace 30 anos se ha querido intervenir sobre el problema de las drogas en la poblacion, elaborando multiples programas que buscaban basicamente la abstinencia de las drogas, pero no han dado grandes resultados. En los ultimos anos se han puesto en marcha programas como el de �reduccion del dano�, que no buscan la abstinencia sino mejorar el estado de salud de los drogodependientes, asi como el de mantenimiento con metadona o el de evitacion del intercambio de jeringuillas, que si han demostrado disminuir notablemente los problemas relacionados con las mismas como la delincuencia o las enfermedades infecciosas. La puesta en marcha de programas de prevencion y la concienciacion de la poblacion son un pilar fundamental para disminuir el consumo y sus consecuencias. La captacion de casos y su seguimiento de cerca son acciones muy importantes para evitar secuelas mayores, asi como el conocimiento por parte del personal sanitario del manejo de estas situaciones.",

      "abstract": "SummaryIn a study of 249 opiate (mainly heroin) addicts special attention was paid to adjunctive drug use. Generally, nicotine (cigarette smoking), alcohol and cannabis preceded the use of heroin, and continued to be used as adjunctive drugs after the establishment of heroin addiction. Nicotine was the most common substance used together with opiates. Alcohol and cannabis were used as adjunctive drugs in about two-thirds of the cases. In the late stages of heroin addiction, benzo-diazepines were also used concomitantly with opiates. The most frequently reported reason for the use of adjunctive drugs was to intensify the effect of the opiate. Three-quarters or more of the addicts had used different adjunctive drugs to boost the euphoric feeling derived from the primary drug, i.e. heroin. Attempt at self-treatment of withdrawal symptoms was a less frequently reported reason for adjunctive drug use. The findings show that heroin addiction is the major problem. The use of adjunctive drugs, especially benzodiazepines, can be partly explained on economic grounds. They must be clearly distinguished from the primary drug of abuse, heroin. For policy-making decisions, it is important that the elimination of heroin abuse through effective prevention measures would ultimately wipe out the problem of adjunctive drug use, while reduction of the overall supply of heroin without reduction in actual demand might result in an increasing trend to adjunctive drug use.Key Words:: Drug dependenceheroin addictionnarcoticscannabisalcoholbenzodiazepinesMalaysia",

      "abstract": "Abstract Smoking among teens and college students is a significant public health challenge. Tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol continue to be the most commonly abused drugs by teens and young adults. Educational efforts have resulted in increased awareness of the mortality and morbidity attributed to smoking, second-hand smoke, and prenatal exposure to tobacco. Short- and long-term consequences of marijuana use are well documented in the literature, but they have received less wide spread attention. Even less well known is the relationship between these substances. Does use of one lead to use of the other? Are there synergistic and/or antagonistic effects when these substances are used together? We need answers to these questions to understand the prevalence of use and the impact of these drugs on our nations youth and young adults. The gateway theory of drug use is often used to describe the progression from using alcohol or tobacco, to marijuana, and later use of other drugs like MDMA, cocaine, and heroin. While tobacco use does commonly precede marijuana use, we propose that marijuana may be a \"gateway drug\" to tobacco smoking. Our research with university students is suggesting that cigarette-smoking initiation often follows or coincides with marijuana use.",

      "title": "Electronic Nicotine Delivery System: End to Smoking or Just a New Fancy Cigarette",
      "abstract": "Smoking and tobacco chewing are the predominant causes of oral cancer. Tobacco is the second-most widely consumed psychoactive substance. There are numerous ways to quit smoking, of which one is electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-cigarette use is a brand-new, global trend. E-cigarette is a battery-operated device that heats a liquid to create a vapor that the consumer inhales. Several countries have acknowledged that the first step toward electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) management is a precise classification of ENDS within the limits of current legislation. Countries have currently categorized ENDS into four generations. People's perceptions about tobacco products have altered recently as a consequence of the advertising of ENDS. The likelihood of starting to smoke cigarettes was four times higher in adolescents who used ENDS, and the probability of quitting was reduced and often prolonged in those who used ENDS. In addition, ENDS normalizes smoking-like actions including inhaling in and exhaling smoke. Adverse marketing via geographic locations and social media platforms, as well as nicotine's irreversible effects on growing adolescent and young adult brains that predispose individuals to addicted behaviors, may be responsible for their rising appeal among teenagers. Despite this, ENDS use has risen among young individuals who have never smoked and undoubtedly face more health risks than those who do not use ENDS. The oral cavity is the first to encounter ENDS in individuals and where it initially affects the human system. As a known contributor to cardiovascular diseases, neurological conditions, and cancers, nicotine seems to be a serious cause for concern. This review provides a concise summary of the research on the components, mode of action, applications, and effects of e-cigarettes on oral as well as systemic systems.",

Fortunately, several new technologies that vaporize nicotine or tobacco may make cigarettes obsolete. Some of these new technologies are developed and owned by the tobacco industry, which invests massively for the research and development of these products. Because of its past scientific misconduct, the tobacco industry is ostracized. In the context of a fierce ideological debate on these new products, it is crucial that regulators and the public are provided with evidence-based guidance. Should the scientific production in this field be done with or without the tobacco industry? This thorny issue is discussed in this comment.",

Some 59 of them had at some time used cocaine more than once a week for a period of some months, when as much as 30 \"lines\" of cocaine were used per day of cocaine use. A sub-group of 28 of the 59 were polydrug users who used opiates, these polydrug users used the largest quantities of cocaine, most often, during their heavy use period and reported most problems with cocaine use. They were also most likely to be unemployed or have low incomes. Nonetheless, both polydrug and heavy users had reduced their cocaine use to relatively low current levels. The implications of these findings for the nature of cocaine dependence and cocaine problems are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Though cocaine has been used by man for centuries for both medical and nonmedical reasons, a knowledge of its effect on the human mind and body remains limited and not yet clearly documented. Sources of information consist of myth, street knowledge, animal studies, and clinical and laboratory studies of man. This paper focuses on findings from the latter two sources. The biological effects of cocaine include the local effects of producing anesthesia and constriction of blood vessels in areas where it is applied topically. Solutions of the drug applied directly to the eye cause the pupils to dilate. Systemic effects include an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. In some individuals, an increase in alertness occurs, and in others a state of drowsiness. The drug also decreases total sleep, REM sleep, and appetite. The psychological effects of the drug vary with dosage, chronicity, and a host of other variables. Increasing doses over long periods of time appear to cause increasingly severe impairment of affective and cognitive functioning. These effects include a strong psychological craving, making cocaine one of the most powerfully reinforcing of all known substances. In addition, cocaine may induce symptoms ranging from mild euphoria to hyperalertness, hyperactivity, anorexia, insomnia, hypersexuality, and proneness to violence. In others, cocaine may produce sadness, melancholia, apathy, and various symptoms of dysphoria. Depression has been reported to occur in people who stop taking the drug, especially those who have taken the drug intravenously. At high doses taken over a long period of time, cocaine may produce symptoms that mimic acute paranoid psychosis with hallucinations, stereotyped behavior, paranoid delusions, insomnia, and proneness to violence. Finally, cocaine may cause delirium, convulsions, and death from cardiorespiratory failure. With over 30 million individuals in the college age group reported to have taken cocaine, college health personnel must be prepared to diagnose and treat symptoms resulting from cocaine toxicity.",

Almost all of their crimes are related to drug abuse beginning about 12 years of age. The epidemic of drug abuse at early ages is based on the failure of families, schools and the communication industry to immunize youths against the contagion of drug abuse and the related rage against our culture which created them. There is one drug abuse arrest every 20 seconds. The growing acceptance of marihuana seems counterproductive. Basically, people want to escape from the rage-creating trends of life. Alcohol and drugs, including marihuana, are easy, but ineffective, ways of doing so.A major overlooked question is “Why? What is our culture doing to make people, beginning in their early puberty, to want to “turn off” rather than eagerly engage in a productive life?” Even those who are well off?

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a spiraling and debilitating condition that has severe social and economic consequences for the individual and society. Recently, much work has examined the relationship between drug addiction and the circadian timing system. The master circadian pacemaker directs a daily temporal rhythm throughout the brain and body including the consumption of alcohol. Many drugs, including alcohol, can have myriad effects at different times of day. Conversely, alcohol can alter circadian physiology at multiple levels within the system. Few studies, however, have examined the role that the timing of chronic drug exposure and withdrawal plays in the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Alcohol use, for example, follows a circadian pattern with consumption peaking in the early evening in non-dependent individuals and withdrawal likely occurring late at night. In the transition to dependence, however, craving and consumption expand earlier into the day. What consequences this altered timing of drug use plays in the physiological and psychological consequences of drug addiction remains to be seen. Herein, we specifically examine if: 1) controlling for time of day in alcohol exposure/withdrawal can alter the development of physical dependence, 2) the development of psychological dependence, and 3) if time of day can become a conditioned environmental cue that triggers craving and behavioral sensitization in an amphetamine model of addiction",

      "title": "Caffeinated energy drink consumption among adolescents and potential health consequences associated with their use: a significant public health hazard.",
      "abstract": "Caffeinated energy drinks (EDs) are increasingly popular among adolescents despite growing evidence of their negative health effects. The consumption of EDs has seen a substantial increase during the past few decades, especially in the Western and Asian countries. EDs contain high levels of caffeine, sugar, and novel ingredients, and are often marketed through youth-oriented media and venues. The known and unknown pharmacology of the constituents of EDs poses a risk of caffeine toxicity and other ill effects when consumed by young people. Caffeine intoxication may result in tachycardia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even death. Other health concerns related to consumption of EDs include obesity and dental enamel erosion resulting from the acidity of EDs. Coingestion of caffeine and ethanol has been associated with increased risk-taking behaviors in adolescent users, impaired driving, and increased use of other illicit substances. Several researchers have demonstrated that consuming alcohol mixed with energy drinks leads to altered subjective states including decreased perceived intoxication, enhanced stimulation, and increased desire to drink/increased drinking compared to consuming alcohol alone. Caffeine's effect on intoxication may be most pronounced when mixers are artificially sweetened, that is, lack sucrose which slows the rate of gastric emptying of alcohol.1) health care providers should educate youth and their parents about the risks of caffeinated drinks; 2) emergency department clinicians should consider asking patients about ED and traditional caffeine usage and substance use when assessing patient symptoms; 3) policy makers should increase their attention on introducing regulatory policies on television food advertising to which youth are exposed; 4) failure to comply with standards for efficacious product labelling, and absence of broader education regarding guidelines, need to be addressed and 5) further studies must be done to improve our understanding of potential negative consequences of caffeinated energy drinks on health.",

Nicotine addiction may be one of the most common in the world, but many people underestimate the health hazards of nicotine. This report, presents nicotine in four parts: harms and addiction; research; conclusions, and further implications. Because nicotine is not like most banned drugs on the market-nicotine cannot be absorbed directly, people must be exposed to nicotine through a certain medium. The most common and intuitive way is through smoking, secondhand smoke, and e-cigarettes. However, most people don’t start smoking because of nicotine addiction, so the authors of this paper conducted experiments on why people start smoking late. Through self-made questionnaires and online experimental surveys, the results showed people were exposed to smoking because of environmental factors, social factors, psychological factors, and so on. People were exposed to nicotine for too long due to their addiction to cigarettes, which evolved into an addiction to nicotine. In the later stage, due to the addictive nature of nicotine, people no longer smoke because of the original addiction to smoking, but because they want to meet the needs of nicotine.",

Tobacco products that can be smoked include cigarettes (manufactured or hand-rolled), cigars and loose tobacco used in pipes and waterpipes.

      "abstract": "Various fitness drinks under the designation of \"energy or power drinks\" or \"brain or athletic food\" are very popular among young people. For those entrusted with rendering expert opinions that poses the question of whether consumption of these beverages is of any importance when a person's ability to drive or mental capacity has to be assessed, especially in combination with alcoholic beverages imbibed at the same time. In the case discussed here-both the 20-year-old car driver and his passenger suffered not inconsiderable injuries-an alcohol concentration of 1.2 per mille was found at the time a blood sample was taken. Furthermore, a caffeine content of 1.5 micrograms/ml was noted. A value also reached after drinking a cup of filter coffee. In contrast, values of 2 to 10 micrograms/ml are reached when caffeine is used for therapeutic purposes. Values of more than 15 micrograms/ml are considered toxic. The measured caffeine content was thus fully insignificant. The same also applies to the \"active ingredients\" (taurine, glucuronolactone) contained in the beverage \"Red Bull\". Another assumption that, namely, the effect of alcohol can be offset by such beverages could lead to a situation in which young people incorrectly assess their ability to drive after imbibing alcohol and fitness drinks. That is naturally given support by corresponding tributes by the manufacturers (\"improves performance\", \"invigorates the mind and body\").",

Este trabajo pretende lograr una aproximacion a las nuevas modalidades de consumo como lo son; el consumo por atracon, el policonsumo y la medicalizacion de la vida cotidiana. Definido el primero como una gran ingesta de alcohol en tiempos reducidos, “el binge drinking”, lo que trajo aparejado el surgimiento de fenomenos tales como la previa en Argentina o el botellon en Espana. Por otro lado a traves de la medicalizacion de la vida cotidiana se persigue farmacologicamente un bienestar perdiendose de vista como fin la curacion, asociandose al bienestar personal y performance socia. Las caracteristicas que adquiere el consumo de drogas en el contexto actual no son mas que definiciones de nueva pauta de consumo sobre sustancias existente a lo largo de la historia, convirtiendose en nuevos desafios para las disciplinas de la salud mental a la hora de abordar la problematica demandando la necesidad de generar nuevos modelos explicativos.\r\nPalabras clave\r\nDrogas Policonsumo Binge Medicalizacion\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nNEW FORMS OF CONSUMPTION In the last century, an increase in drug use has occurred due to problems rising mainly from alcohol and medicine abuse and changes in the use of traditional drugs. As a result, a new appreciation about the consumption problem has been gained. This work attempts to give a closer look to the new ways of consuming drugs, such as gorging, poly-consumption and daily medication intake. Gorging is defined as an excessive intake of alcohol in shorts periods of time, the “binge drinking”what brings about phenomena like “la previa” in Argentina or “el botellon” in Spain. About daily medication intake, it can be said that through it a feeling of personal and social well- being is pursued, leaving aside the purpose of healing. The characteristics acquired by drug consumption nowadays are just definitions of new consumption criteria about substances that existed throughout and which become a challenge for different disciplines and which demand the need of creating new descriptive models to handle this problem.\r\nKey words\r\nDrug Consumption Binge Medicalization",

      "title": "Enhancement drugs: are there limits to what we should enhance and why?",
      "abstract": "Substances, such as alcohol, opiates and cannabis, have been used by humans for millennia. Today, a much wider range of substances are used for a range of purposes, including the enhancement of performance during university studies, sexual experiences, sports, exercise, at celebrations, socializing and the experience of art and music. Substance use is also associated with a range of harmful effects to the individual and society as a whole. Prohibitions, regulation, prevention and treatment have all been used to protect against this harm. In this commentary, it is argued that public health interventions should target relevant harms and not to evaluate which aspects of human endeavors and experiences should be enhanced and which should not. It is argued that interventions should directly target the harmful effects, using the best available evidence. Two examples are given of substances that may be altered to prevent serious harm - one for alcohol and one for cannabis. In the case of alcohol, the addition of dissolved oxygen could reduce both the risk of accidents and the risk of liver damage associated with alcohol consumption. In the case of cannabis, there is strong indication that the reduction of content Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol and the increase of cannabidiol could reduce the risk of psychoses and the addiction associated with its use. The aim of this article is to show that responsible regulation should not necessarily be restricted to preventing the use and/or (in the case of alcohol) a reduction in the amounts and frequency of its use, but should also aim to include a range of other strategies that could reduce the burden of illness associated with illicit substance use.",

While low levels of liquor utilization may have medical advantages, ceaseless ill-use of liquor harmfully affects most body frameworks and adds to or intensifies more than sixty malady conditions. [1] Beverages containing ethanol are normally known as hard beverages. [2] Ethanol is an old recreational and social drink effectively acquired by maturation of sugars and devoured all through the world. The most elevated amount of utilization is seen in created countries. [3] In the course of recent decades the utilization of illicit medications and abuse of helpful medications has spread at a remarkable rate and influences all aspects of the globe.

[6] Liquor utilization is connected with the main sources of death among youth. [7] An anomalous practical association in the cerebrum of a person with addictive issue brings about an upgraded notability of medication related signals and debilitated subjective control. [8] Liquor is a known human teratogen that creates physical, mental, behavioral and psychological abnormalities.

      "title": "Influence of Time of Day in the Development of Physiological and Behavioral Drug Dependence in Mice",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a spiraling and debilitating condition that has severe social and economic consequences for the individual and society. Recently, much work has examined the relationship between drug addiction and the circadian timing system. The master circadian pacemaker directs a daily temporal rhythm throughout the brain and body including the consumption of alcohol. Many drugs, including alcohol, can have myriad effects at different times of day. Conversely, alcohol can alter circadian physiology at multiple levels within the system. Few studies, however, have examined the role that the timing of chronic drug exposure and withdrawal plays in the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Alcohol use, for example, follows a circadian pattern with consumption peaking in the early evening in non-dependent individuals and withdrawal likely occurring late at night. In the transition to dependence, however, craving and consumption expand earlier into the day. What consequences this altered timing of drug use plays in the physiological and psychological consequences of drug addiction remains to be seen. Herein, we specifically examine if: 1) controlling for time of day in alcohol exposure/withdrawal can alter the development of physical dependence, 2) the development of psychological dependence, and 3) if time of day can become a conditioned environmental cue that triggers craving and behavioral sensitization in an amphetamine model of addiction",

      "title": "Smoking Cessation Leads to Reduced Stress, but Why?",
      "abstract": "Recent longitudinal studies have demonstrated that smoking cessation leads to reduced feelings of stress. This finding is not predicted by either of the two main models for smoking behavior. The nicotine resource model (Warburton) states that nicotine is used to cope with external stressors, and predicts that smokers will suffer from increased stress when they quit smoking. The deprivation reversal model (Schachter), suggests that smoking reverses the deleterious effects of deprivation; cessation will then lead to a period of increased stress, followed by a return to baseline. Although the stress/cessation data agree with neither model, they are consistent with a third explanation, namely that smoking causes stress. This model states that acute nicotine deprivation (i.e., between cigarettes) leads to increased stress. Smokers then use cigarettes to reverse these withdrawal effects and \"normalize\" their mood. This model explains some paradoxical aspects of the smoking/mood relationship. First, why smokers are calmed by smoking, yet report high average levels of stress. Second, why stress levels become reduced after smoking cessation; this is because the former smoker no longer suffers from the adverse mood effects of acute nicotine depletion.",

      "abstract": "Avec la montee des plaintes concernant les conditions de travail, le stress, l’intensification du travail, l’angoisse de perdre son emploi et d’etre declasse, il n’est pas rare d’entendre evoquer, dans les medias et les entretiens de certains salaries, la prise de substances psychoactives (legales ou non) pour tenir le coup, etouffer les souffrances ou augmenter les performances. Pourtant il n’existe encore que peu de travaux en sociologie du travail sur le sujet . Sans doute la complexite des liens entre travail et consommation de substances psychoactives tres heterogenes (tabac, alcool, cafe, medicaments, drogues « dures » ou « douces », etc.) explique une part de cette prudence ; tout comme la volonte de ne pas participer a ce que certains percoivent comme la construction du probleme des drogues au travail dans le cadre d’un processus de disciplinarisation de la main d’œuvre. Au sein de plusieurs grandes entreprises, des campagnes de « promotion de la sante » tentent en effet d’agir sur les attitudes des salaries pour reduire les consommations de drogue, de tabac ou d’alcool comme s’il s’agissait de choix individuels sans liens avec le travail. Pourtant, il est bien difficile de dire a priori si une consommation est provoquee par le travail, le contexte personnel et prive ou la simple recherche de plaisir ! Quand des difficultes professionnelles et/ou economiques rejaillissent sur la vie privee et peuvent expliquer la recherche de petits plaisirs consolatoires a travers la consommation de stupefiants, il est delicat d’avoir une attitude moralisatrice et de « condamnation de la victime ». Comment la souffrance – egalement une construction sociale complexe – et la consommation de substances psychoactives (legales ou non) peuvent etre liees ? Les recherches epidemiologiques donnent quelques pistes, mais restent difficiles a interpreter. Il existerait des schemas collectifs tant dans la perception et la gestion du mal-etre au travail, qu’en ce qui en ce qui concerne les representations que les usages de substances psychoactives. Apres avoir rappele le cadre general d’analyse de la construction collective du stress et des consommations ainsi que les differences de genres ou entre CSP, quatre illustrations rapides a partir d’observations sociohistoriques et ethnographiques sur les ouvriers, les infirmieres hospitalieres, les policiers et les conducteurs de bus, donneront un peu de chair a cette analyse.",

Since the vast majority of cigarette smokers begin smoking by age 25, understanding the role of menthol cigarettes in the initiation of smoking in youth (under the age of 18) and young adults (aged 18-25) is especially relevant. Data demonstrate that menthol cigarettes are disproportionately used by youth and young adults. This review seeks to examine what role, if any, menthol plays in the initiation of cigarette smoking. Overall, there is a paucity of data on this topic. The data that do exist suggests that youth who have smoked for less than 1 year are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than youth who have smoked for more than 1 year. A lack of data prevents further conclusions on the role of menthol cigarettes in the initiation of smoking.",

      "title": "CHAPTER 1. Exposure to Lead and Cognitive Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Lead's neurotoxicity has been recognized for centuries. In spite of this knowledge, in the twentieth century, lead-based products— from gasoline to paint to other consumer products—pervaded the consumer and industrial landscape. The upshot was a dramatic increase in humans’ exposures to lead. In the United States, powerful commercial interests, abetted by willing or negligent government officials, overwhelmed the protests of public health advocates, who warned about the harm caused by lead exposure. Thus the removal of lead from these products occurred very slowly. By the 1990s, when lead had been removed from most consumer gasoline and paint, many individuals had experienced protracted exposures, some over the entire course of their lives. The cognitive impairment resulting from high-dose occupational exposure is well-established, and exposure at much lower doses in children can impair their intellectual development. Yet accumulating evidence indicates that long-term exposures at low doses and/or past exposures (that have since ended) may have effects that reverberate in the cognition of older age. Moreover, although lead exposures have declined in many parts of the world, pockets of exposure remain. These continued exposures and an aging global population mean that it is critical to continue to reduce exposures and better understand, and mitigate, the effects of lead exposure on cognitive aging. In this chapter, we review the critical events that resulted in widespread exposures to lead, the mechanisms underlying lead's deleterious effects on cognition, and findings from research on cumulative lead exposure and cognitive function in older age.",

      "abstract": "When we learn from a patient, clinician, or medical record that a drug has been discontinued, it is logical to ask why. The drug may no longer be needed; it may not have produced the desired effect; it may have produced an adverse reaction; a better drug may be available to replace the original drug. The patient may have discontinued the drug because he or she could not see why it was necessary; or the patient may have discontinued the drug because of unpleasant side effects. A drug may not work because its absorption is reduced by physical or chemical interaction with another drug or a food component. It may also not work because the patient's metabolism is speeded up or in hibited to an extent such that the desired duration of drug action is not obtained. Such an effect may be related to a change in diet. Side effects may be related to consumption of specific foods or bev erages or to an overall change in nutritional status. Drug-food and drug-alcohol incompatibility reactions are frequent but are avoidable if a patient is warned of their possible occurrence. Drugs may also produce nutritional deficiencies, especially in a patient whose diet is marginal in those nutrients depleted by the particular drug. Careful prescribing practices together with appropriate nutrient supplements will serve to reduce the risk of these incompatibilities.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion: La Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS) define la adolescencia como el periodo de tiempo considerado de los 10 a los 19 anos, actualmente en Mexico residen alrededor de 12.8 millones de adolescentes entre 12 y 17 anos de edad, representando cerca de la quinta parte de la poblacion total. Es esencialmente una epoca de cambios que trae consigo enormes variaciones fisicas y emocionales, transformando al nino en adulto ya que en la adolescencia se define la personalidad, se construye la independencia y se fortalece la autoafirmacion. Uno de los principales problemas en esta etapa, es el consumo de tabaco lo que constituye un grave problema que cada vez es mayor, ya que muchos adolescentes estan comenzando a fumar desde edades cada vez mas tempranas, por presion social de los amigos, por curiosidad o por el afan de experimentar, lo que pone en riesgo su salud y su calidad de vida Objetivos: Conocer la prevalencia del consumo de tabaco en adolescentes estudiantes; conocer la edad de inicio en el consumo; detectar las posibles causas del inicio del tabaquismo; conocer la prevalencia de adolescentes fumadores pasivos; conocer la permisibilidad en la educacion que reciben los adolescentes por parte de sus progenitores; conocer la valoracion que tiene el adolescente del perjuicio que supone el tabaco; conocer la relacion de prevalencia entre padres fumadores.\n Metodologia: El estudio fue de tipo cuantitativo, descriptivo de tipo no experimental. La poblacion sujeta de estudio fueron 1122 adolescentes de 12 a 15 anos de edad estudiantes de secundaria. La informacion se obtuvo mediante la tecnica de la encuesta misma que fue adecuada para los fines de este estudio. Las encuestas se aplicaron previo consentimiento informado, asegurandose en todo momento la privacidad y anonimato de la informacion.\n Resultados: Los resultados obtenidos reflejan la prevalencia del consumo de tabaco en adolescentes de 12 a 15 anos la cual fue de 24.06%, la edad de inicio del consumo fue mas frecuente en los adolescentes de 12 anos, la causa mas frecuente que indican los adolescentes para el consumo de tabaco es la curiosidad (86.52%) lo que hace que se convierta un factor de riesgo para continuar, el 23.7% de los adolescentes no reciben informacion sobre los danos ocasionados por el tabaco, el acceso al tabaco es facil, tanto por adquisicion o por los amigos, tienen creencias erroneas lo que pueden conducir a un mayor indice de fumadores, asi mismo se encontro significancia entre el habito de fumar y el consumo de alcohol, entre los adolescentes.",

      "abstract": "Youth around the world take up smoking and use tobacco products at high rates. Young people may not grasp the long-term consequences of tobacco use, although tobacco consumption and exposure has been shown to have significant negative health effects. Youth use a variety of tobacco products that are smoked, chewed, or sniffed, including machine-manufactured cigarettes, cigars, bidis, kreteks, sticks, and snuff. Prevention efforts have focused on countering those aspects that are believed to contribute to smoking uptake, such as tobacco industry advertising and promotion, and access to tobacco. There are many aspects of tobacco promotion through the media that have been more difficult to control, however, such as product placement within popular cinema movies. Once a youth has taken up tobacco, he or she is more likely than an adult to become addicted and should be offered treatment for tobacco cessation. Although there is not yet sufficient evidence to prove efficacy, the same treatments are suggested for youth as are recommended for adults, including nicotine replacement products. Given the severity of the tobacco epidemic worldwide and the devastating health effects on an individual and population basis, there are currently many efforts to curtail the tobacco problem, including the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It is through comprehensive and collaborative efforts such as this that the global hazard of tobacco is most likely to be overcome.",

      "abstract": "The intake of alcoholic beverages is a huge social issue. Worldwide, an estimated 2.3 billion individuals consume alcohol, with an average daily consumption of 33 grammes of pure alcohol. Self-esteem is a measure of one’s self-awareness and sense of personal worth. The process of behaving and then thinking about acts, as well as how others interpret actions, shapes one’s self-perception. Self-esteem refers to how we feel about ourselves and how much we regard ourselves. Alcoholism has far-reaching consequences and might result in mental health issues. One of the most typical effects found in alcoholics is the development of poor self-esteem. This term refers to a person’s total subjective sentiments of personal worth and value. It has a wide range of effects. It has an impact on a variety aspect of life, including substance abuse and recovery. The majority of alcoholics have a low sense of self-esteem. They have struggled to cope with their lives and frequently have significant emotional, family, social, and occupational issues, as well as financial, legal, and sexual issues. Coping is frequently studied in terms of its potential to reduce negative consequences. Coping skills can also help you achieve more favourable results.",

      "title": "Risks of Attempting to Regulate Nicotine Flux in Electronic Cigarettes",
      "abstract": "In their recent analysis, Shihadeh and Eissenberg1 support that by regulating nicotine flux in electronic cigarettes (ECs) could be a valuable tool in the regulatory process that would increase effectiveness and reduce the chance for abuse liability. Herein, we present the view that such a regulation could endanger the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as smoking substitutes.\r\n\r\nNicotine Delivery From Tobacco Cigarettes\r\nAlthough tobacco cigarettes deliver 1–3mg of nicotine (from about 14mg in each rod), the levels of daily nicotine intake may vary considerably between users. This is partly attributed to a substantial variability in nicotine intake per cigarette caused by different smoking intensity.2 It is also possible to smoke more than one cigarette consecutively, further avoiding the limitation of the tobacco cigarette rod standardized design. Therefore, smokers can adjust cigarette use based on personal needs, while it is extremely unlikely for smoking to cause nicotine intoxication or overdose.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicotine Delivery From ECs\r\nElectronic cigarettes differ remarkably from tobacco cigarettes in terms of nicotine delivery. There is no standardized unit of consumption. Consumers usually report their daily consumption in milliliters of liquid,3 which cannot be directly compared with daily cigarette consumption. The variability in equipment design and potential, and the range of nicotine content in EC liquids provide consumers with the ability to adjust use patterns and nicotine intake. Surveys of dedicated EC users (which were all former smokers) have shown that high nicotine levels are important especially for the initiation of EC use.3,4 Although nicotine delivery to the aerosol can be similar or higher than tobacco cigarettes,5,6 clinical studies of EC use have shown that the nicotine absorption potential is significantly lower compared with tobacco cigarettes, even when new generation devices are used.7 This is mostly attributed to the low speed of nicotine absorption, and clearly indicates that nicotine intoxication is highly unlikely when ECs are used as intended. Therefore, despite the ability to adjust use patterns, ECs are currently not as efficient as tobacco cigarettes in nicotine delivery.\r\n\r\nWe propose that the comparison between ECs and tobacco cigarettes would be similar to comparing, respectively a car with a large selection of powerful (in selected cases) engines (i.e., nicotine delivery to the aerosol) but very heavy structure (i.e., reduced rate of absorption for a given nicotine content per puff), with a car with less variability and lower-powered engines but very lightweight structure. With current technology, overall performance (i.e., nicotine delivery to the bloodstream) is definitely in favor of the tobacco cigarette, and smokers may be unable to adequately satisfy their nicotine cravings with EC use despite the ability to adjust use patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pleasure Factor in EC Use\r\nIt is physiologically plausible to support that nicotine induces pleasure and reduces anxiety in smokers.8 The pleasure factor has been largely neglected and marginalized by the tobacco control movement which is usually following the pathology paradigm framework for nicotine use.9 Perceived pleasure should not be a reason for anyone to initiate smoking (due to exposure to known risks for health damage) or EC use (due to exposure to yet unknown, although evidently much lower than smoking, risk). However, it should be considered and evaluated when discussing about smoking substitution. Surveys indicate that pleasure could be a potential reason for smokers to choose and maintain long-term EC use.3,10 This is probably one of the main reasons for the enormous variability of different flavors available in EC liquids,10 and could explain the variability of devices with different characteristics, design, and properties. The recent development and marketing of atomizers with adjustable airflow probably reflects the different preferences by users, and the effort of manufacturers to create products which can be customized based on self-preference. Since the main objective should always be elimination of smoking, the pleasure effect could be an advantage of ECs over other products which should be welcomed if it contributes to smoking reduction or cessation. Further studies are needed to examine this aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs There a Need to Regulate Nicotine Flux in ECs?\r\nBased on the evidence presented above, and with current technological evolution, it is our opinion that regulating nicotine flux in ECs, in terms of restricting usage patterns (e.g., restrict puff duration or apply a minimum interpuff interval), is unnecessary. It carries the potential risk of reducing ECs’ efficacy as smoking substitutes, while it provides no benefit in terms of safety. There is already the example of regulatory decisions by the European Union, which defined an upper limit of 20mg/ml nicotine concentration in EC liquids (http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/dir_201440_en.pdf) based on information about potential nicotine delivery to the aerosol.6 They failed to recognize that both effectiveness and abuse liability are determined by nicotine absorption (speed and amount delivered to the blood stream) rather than nicotine delivery to the aerosol. As a result, it is possible that such a restriction could exclude some smokers from effectively using ECs as smoking substitutes.\r\n\r\nResearch on nicotine flux could become an essential tool in the development of more effective EC products and in informing consumers about the characteristics of each device so that they make appropriate choices. There are two options for ECs development: (a) using higher nicotine concentration in liquid and (b) improving the absorption rate. The former results in intense (and, for many users, unbearable) throat irritation (“throat hit”), added to the irritation induced by the humectants in the aerosol (propylene glycol and glycerol). The latter may occur from adjusting use behavior (e.g., taking longer and deeper puffs, although this may make the use tiring), adjusting power delivery (which leads to more liquid consumption and aerosol production per given puff duration) and reformulating EC liquids in order to deliver and deposit nicotine more effectively into the lungs. It is possible that improvement in nicotine delivery efficacy could make ECs more addictive. This is not a concern for smokers (who are already nicotine-dependent) but for nonsmokers who may adopt EC use. However, this raises an important ethical issue: should a product, which is probably beneficial for a part of the population (smokers), be restricted (which could result in reduced efficacy as a smoking substitute) because some other parts of the population (nonsmokers) decide to voluntarily adopt its use and expose themselves to a new (even minor) risk? Measures such as proper education, regulation of advertising, and prohibition of promotion and sales to nonsmoking youth could effectively ensure that ECs will not be used by nonsmokers without restricting their potential to substitute smoking.",

There are different types of Dhumapana, each with specific purposes. For instance, it can relieve headaches, respiratory issues, or eye problems and even help with emotional well-being. Dhoomanetra is a special instrument used to perform Dhumapana. This is designed in such a way that makes sure the smoke is inhaled properly. There are specific instructions to be followed based on the type of herbs and substances used for Dhumapana. However, it's crucial to be aware of the Dhumapana contraindications, such as being too young or old or suffering from specific Pitta-related health issues. Dhumapana can have negative effects if performed improperly or excessively, although these effects can be controlled using ayurvedic treatments. Dhumapana can be included into a daily schedule to assist maintain a healthy body, mind, and senses. It is both therapeutic and preventative measures.",

      "abstract": "People seeking treatment for alcohol problems frequently abuse other drugs as well, such as tobacco, cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, and opiates. The problem of polydrug use raises important issues for treatment providers. A person who abuses multiple drugs may have a more difficult time stopping drinking and a higher risk for relapse to alcohol use after treatment. Conversely, a person who successfully stops drinking may offset this achievement by substituting another drug for alcohol. Successful treatment must take into account both alcohol- and drug-related issues, with particular emphasis on assessment, motivation, treatment design, and outcome evaluation.",

Many patients will not be seeking treatment for their substance misuse but can be reassured that treatment will be forthcoming should their attitude change in the future. Alcohol is an important factor in the addiction picture for many homeless patients. It is a fact of life in the homeless environment, with many homeless people having primary alcohol problems. Even if the patient is not using alcohol at the time of assessment, it is extremely common, if not the norm, for alcohol use to creep in as substitute prescribing is instituted and street drug usage decreases.

      "title": "On the duration of cannabis effects and the presence of THC in the body",
      "abstract": "When tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the most important psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, is present in sufficiently high concentrations it affects brain function. It is important to know the duration of this effect, both for medical and recreational use. New studies indicate that small amounts of cannabis remain present in the brain longer than previously assumed and accumulate with repeated intake. The possible consequences are currently unknown. To guide information-based cannabis choices, we call for further research. Cannabis use is increasing [1], as are the average THC levels in cannabis products [2]. The question of the duration of THC presence in the brain and the subsequent effects thus become more urgent. Long-term negative effects have been suggested to involve cognitive impairment, including memory, learning and impulse control [3]. Some studies indicate that this may have to do with functional or structural changes in the brain [4, 5]. However, most psychoactive effects of THC fade during the first hours after cannabis smoking and are mostly gone 6–8 hours after intake [6]. After occasional smoking of 30–50 mg, a common intake per day for recreational users [7], THC plasma concentrations fall from approximately 50–100 ng/ml at peak to approximately 0.5–2 ng/ml at distribution equilibrium 6–8 hours later [8-10]. Twenty-four hours after smoking, most users will have plasma levels below 1 ng/ml and below the detection limit of several analytical methods (often 0.5 ng/ml). This could give the impression that THC is no longer present in the body. However, with an ultrasensitive analytical method, THC plasma levels have been detected for 10–28 days after smoking of approximately 30 mg THC on 2 consecutive days in an experimental study [11]. That study estimated the terminal half-life (T½) of THC in 10 subjects to be 4.3 (2.6–12.6) days. Recent population pharmacokinetic studies have reported a mean T½ of THC from 21.5 hours to 3.5 days [10, 12, 13]. According to general pharmacokinetic principles, the THC plasma concentration after a period of 5 T½ will be 3% of the level at distribution equilibrium. Taken together, these findings suggest that THC may be present in low concentrations from 5 to 60 days. An important question is whether these very low THC levels, which are comparable with the human plasma levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide [14], will be interfering with the brain function through an impact on the endocannabinoid systems. Repeated smoking within this period would lead to accumulated THC levels and probably increase the risk of interference. The duration of the low-concentration period shows marked individual differences in naturalistic studies of frequent smokers [15-18] and in less frequent cannabis smokers [19]. The reason for this variation in T½ is currently unknown, but could be dependent upon analytical methodology or biopharmacological factors such as gender, age, body mass index, pattern of use and drug interactions. In our opinion, data on the fate of THC in the human body expressed as comprehensive information on its T½, and similar to that required for medicinal drugs, should be available also to all users of cannabis.

      "abstract": "Abstract : Addiction and drug abuse are pervasive in society, and can result in illness, legal and financial trouble, and even death for dependent users. Licit substances, including alcohol, are widely available, easily obtainable, and relatively inexpensive. More than 75% of Americans have used alcohol at least once in their lifetime, and more than half of adults are current drinkers. Unlike most other drugs, alcohol may be health-promoting in low to moderate doses. Excessive alcohol intake can cause serious immediate and long-term consequences to the drinker and to others. There is substantial anecdotal, clinical, and some experimental evidence that environmental factors, especially stress and social environment, affect alcohol self-administration. Stress often is associated with increased alcohol consumption. Social enrichment decreases drug self-administration, but there is mixed evidence regarding social enrichment and alcohol intake. These relationships lack experimental examination and the mechanisms underlying these relationships are not clear. The purpose of this research project was to examine experimentally the individual and combined effects of stress and social enrichment on alcohol self-administration (in two bottle choice and operant self-administration paradigms) and alcohols effects on dopaminergic and serotonergic responses in the brain (nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortex) and on psychological constructs (anxiety via open field center time and depression via forced swim test) in male Wistar rats. The major hypotheses were: (1) stress would increase alcohol consumption and increase alcohols effects on the stress response; (2) alcohol would decrease the biological and attenuate the psychological stress response; and (3) social enrichment would decrease alcohol consumption, attenuate the stress response, and attenuate alcohols effects on the stress response.",

      "title": "Life before birth: are the dice tossed for the rest of our lives?",
      "abstract": "Without any exception, every human being has spent at least a considerable amount of time in the womb and has gone through the stressful process of being born. However, the quantity and quality of our life before birth varies tremendously between people. That is, some individuals survive birth after only 22 weeks of pregnancy [1] and others have the luxury of being born after spending more than 40 weeks in utero. Perhaps more importantly than the duration are the conditions of our stay: Do we receive enough and healthy nutrition? Are we exposed to toxics like tobacco, alcohol or drugs? Is the oxygen supply sufficient? Are we being subjected to high levels of stress hormones? Are we getting infected by bacteria or viruses? And then…birth. By some considered as the most stressful life event we will ever have to endure. A certain amount of stress is actually necessary for survival: The high level of hormones released during birth, which are also involved in the stress response, are believed to make the newborn more alert promoting the bonding process and, by extension, the child’s physical survival [2]. However, while a certain amount of stress is necessary for survival, extreme and/or prolonged stress can affect health adversely [3]. For example, it has been shown that people who had underwent an extremely stressful birth (defined as vaginal delivery with fetal suffering or forceps use, urgent cesarean section indicated by fetal suffering or twin birth with death of the other fetus) were 5 times more likely to have developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in the year following a stressful life event compared to OCD patients without an extremely stressful birth [4]. In other words, the former group had more often a stress-event-related onset of OCD compared to the latter group, indexing the possibility that a very stressful birth creates a life-long enhanced vulnerability to stress and an enhanced risk of developing anxiety related symptoms, such as OCD. Animal studies also suggest that a single aversive life event may be capable of permanently affecting the individual’s sensitivity towards experiences in life after birth [5].\r\n\r\nThe importance of a prosperous prenatal environment and birth process for future health has long been recognized. Conversely, exposure to early adversity during a sensitive period of development is thought to lead to structural, physiological and metabolic changes in the fetus that increase susceptibility to later disease [6]. For instance, antenatal maternal and infant malnutrition [7, 8], antenatal maternal stress [9], low birth weight, younger maternal age and increasing birth order [10–13] have all, amongst others, been linked to poorer mental health. Particularly in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the role of adverse prenatal and perinatal factors is well-documented. Compelling evidence exists for associations between an increased risk for ASD on the one hand and maternal infections during pregnancy, increased parental age, fetal hypoxia, prematurity, and low birth weight on the other hand [14–16]. More broadly viewed, as reported by Guedeney et al. in this issue and previously by others [17–19], associations have been found between pre- and perinatal risks and sustained social withdrawal behavior (more prevalent than ASD but considered a red flag for developing clinical disorders such as ASD, attachment disorders and depression) [20–22]. In any case, life before birth is related to mental health outcomes in life after birth.\r\n\r\nHowever, it remains to be determined to what extent these factors are true risk mediators (causally involved) or rather risk indicators (linked to an increased risk but not contributing causally to the adverse outcome). Two main reasons why prenatal risks may act as risk indicators, are that these factors are associated with postnatal risks (such as social adversity and parent mental health problems) and that they relate to unmeasured confounders, such as maternally transmitted inherited factors [6]. Studies commonly deal with these two possibilities by adjusting for measured confounders. For instance, it was recently shown that when social class, family structure and religion were corrected for, prenatal circumstances were not or only marginally associated with mental health outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood [23]. Further support for the hypothesis that perinatal factors may often act as indicators instead of mediators of poor mental health was reported in a series of elegantly designed studies by Thapar and colleagues [24–26]. Using genetically informative designs, in which mothers were either genetically related or unrelated to their child as a result of assisted reproductive technologies, they showed that relationships between smoking during pregnancy and ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms, and also between breastfeeding and lower levels of conduct problems, were only present in the genetically related group and not in the genetically unrelated group [24–26]. These studies teased apart the intrauterine and genetic influences normally intertwined in explaining the fetal origins of chronic diseases and suggest pre- and perinatal risk factors may sometimes act as a proxy for the underlying genetic risk transmitted to offspring.\r\n\r\nHowever, elegant as these studies may be in examining the role of prenatal risks in isolation from a genetic background, the reality of life is that the vast majority of people are conceived in the natural way and spend their life before and after birth with their biological parents. Therefore, genetic and environmental factors correlate and interact in various complex ways, causing substantial differences between people in their exposure and susceptibility to both positive and negative environmental influences [27, 28]. This differential susceptibility may be labeled as “prenatal programming of postnatal plasticity” [29] and one of the mechanisms underlying this may be epigenetics. Epigenetics can be broadly defined as those heritable changes not dependant on the genomic sequence and encompasses a variety of mechanisms to dynamically modify the expression of the genome [30]. There appear to be “discrete epigenetic checkpoints” [30] during which the genome is extra sensitive to modifications by environmental factors. This illustrates that in real life there is no effect of prenatal risk in isolation from a genetic background or vice versa.\r\n\r\nSo, in life before birth, are the dice tossed for the rest of our lives? The influence of the prenatal environment on mental health later in life is unequivocally present. Often the dice are unfairly being tossed, with some children receiving the best of odds and others the worst. However, what the best odds are is not predetermined, but may vary according to the environment in which the child grows up. In some cases, the last shall be the first.",

      "title": "Strategies to Help Patients Break the Chains of Tobacco Addiction: Evidence-Based Treatments Can Help Patients Quit despite Psychiatric Illness",
      "abstract": "You are treating Mr. P, age 34, for schizoaffective disorder. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and has smoked for approximately 17 years. He has tried to stop but never has been able to quit for more than a few weeks. He reveals whenever he tries to quit, he starts feeling extremely lethargic and and resumes smoking to prevent these symptoms from worsening. However, Mr. P expresses some interest in trying to quit again and asks whether any medications could prevent him from becoming depressed while he tries to quit Cigarette smoking is overrepresented and undertreated among individuals with psychiatric illness, in part because of the largely unfounded belief held by some patients and clinicians that smoking cessation might worsen psychiatric symptoms. In this article, we argue this challenge can be overcome and psychiatrists and other mental health professionals can and should help their patients reap the innumerable benefits of quitting smoking. We discuss: * the short-and long-term effects of smoking cessation * evidence-based treatment guidelines for working with motivated and unmotivated smokers * unique issues that may arise when treating smokers who have psychiatric disorders. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Quitting: Profound benefits Quitting smoking has substantial benefits beginning within minutes after taking the last puff. Some of the benefits that occur within the first few days of quitting include: * decreased blood pressure and pulse rate * improved circulation * improved ability to smell and taste * easier breathing. Longer-term smoking abstinence drastically reduces risk of heart attack, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease, and a host of other illnesses that affect--and kill--individuals with psychiatric disorders several decades earlier than their counterparts in the general population. (1) There also are financial benefits to quitting; using the 2009 national average of $5.33 per pack, a 1-pack-per-day smoker who quits would save > $150 per month, which accounts for only the direct cost of cigarettes. (2) Although the beneficial effects of quitting smoking are profound and far-reaching, in the short-term they are counterbalanced by nicotine withdrawal symptoms--including restlessness, irritability, depressed mood, concentration problems, and increased appetite/weight gain--that are formidable distractions from the positive aspects of quitting. Additionally nicotine withdrawal symptoms tend to be more severe in smokers who have a psychiatric disorder. (3) Fortunately, there are effective, evidence-based methods of reducing withdrawal symptoms and helping smokers cope with these and other challenges of quitting. Combined treatment is best Current treatment guidelines (4) suggest all smokers should be offered pharmacotherapy and counseling to aid quitting because this combined approach has the highest success rate (Algorithm). Table 1 (page 44) (4) provides information about dosing, efficacy, and side effect profile of each of the 7 FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation. Using any of the approved medications at least doubles the odds of successful quitting compared with placebo. (4) These pharmacotherapies can reduce or prevent nicotine withdrawal symptoms and--at least in the case of bupropion and varenicline--decrease reinforcement from smoking, thereby lowering the likelihood a lapse (ie, smoking [greater than or equal to] 1 cigarettes without returning to regular smoking) will develop into a full-blown relapse (ie, return to regular smoking).

      "abstract": "Summary The urge to smoke is by far the most commonly reported subjective response to cigarette withdrawal. It is worse in smokers with higher nicotine intake and can be reduced by a nicotine substitute. Although it may occur at any time during abstinence, it can be increased by stress and boredom and reduced when the smoker is kept occupied. Craving for cigarettes probably has multiple causation arising partly out of the perceived benefits of smoking and negative consequences of not smoking and partly as a direct result of loss of nicotine. Whatever its root causes it would be expected to involve general psychological processes such as associative learning and attribution. This paper draws together the threads of pharmacological and psychological levels of explanation for cigarette craving in an attempt to provide a clearer understanding of this phenomenon.",

There is an unwillingness to recognise the distinction between the concept of illicit drug use and the realities of hard-core abuse. Addictive behaviour involves a wide range of substances. It includes abuse of or dependencies on nicotine, banned or illegal drugs, psychoactive medications and alcohol. Why do people take drugs? Since antiquity, both civilized and primitive people have used a near infinite number of chemical substances for such purposes as seeking pleasure, pursuing divine insight, escapism, and increasing aggression or strength, as well as the socially acceptable purpose of preventing or treating disease. South Africa is in a drug crisis, where substance abuse is now recognised as being the biggest threat facing our youth. The use of drugs by young people is a widespread and growing problem. Adolescent substance abuse is increasing at an alarming rate, and national trends indicate that the average age when chemical experimentation occurs is decreasing. Adolescence is a period of particular vulnerability. During the transition from childhood to adulthood, the young person has no real status in our society. Young people are constantly trying to achieve an identity and find new ways to handle the stresses of growing up. In order to fully understand the impact that substance abuse has, it is important to focus on the latest trends taking place amongst our youth. Cues for drug abuse identification Although drug abuse in its different forms can produce recognisable effects, those effects can be similar to conditions not related to drug abuse at all. Generally there are signs which may suggest drug abuse, and these may include the following: 1. Sudden and dramatic changes in discipline",

      "abstract": "The weight increase which immediately follows the cessation of smoking is often dissuasive. All things being equal otherwise, the weight and adiposity of smokers are lower than those of non-smokers. The calorie intake of smokers is equal to that of non-smokers, but the nicotine absorbed with each cigarette smoked temporarily increases the basal metabolism and in particular the energy expended in all physical activities. The lack of compensatory increase of food intake in response to the increase of energy expenditure explains why smokers are underweight. Food consumption might be reduced by an increase of circulating fatty acids and by a nicotine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion. The weight increase observed after tobacco withdrawal is caused by the normalization of expenditures and by release of the brake on food consumption. Weight increase is usually important in heavy smokers, women and subjects with low physical activity. Fifty per cent of smokers who have given up smoking put on less than 3 kg. The effort required to mitigate this disadvantage is modest and it can be delayed and separated from the acute weaning period with a medicinal treatment.",

Experiments with humans are ethically unacceptable. As an approach to the issue, this article also takes reports from the popular press into account. Altogether, it seems possible to survive without food and drink within a time span of 8 to 21 days. If a person is only deprived of food, the survival time may even go up to about two months, although this is influenced by many factors.

Loneliness and severe depression often accompany these losses, making the elderly especially vulnerable to suicide. Among the warning signs to look for are changes in patterns of sleeping or eating, weight loss, extreme fatigue, increased preoccupation with bodily functions, increased alcohol consumption, mood or behavioral changes, and sudden interest or disinterest in religion. Many of these signal depression. Most of the elderly who commit suicide do so not long after visiting a physician. Thus, responsibility for prevention lies not only with family and friends of the suicidal elderly person but with the physician as well.

      "abstract": "\"Pica\" is the term used to describe craving for non-food and nonnutritive items like dirt, chalk, or paper. Pagophagia (compulsive ice chewing) is a particular form of pica that is characterized by ingestion of ice, freezer frost, or iced drinks. It is usually associated with iron deficiency anemia or mental abnormalities like intellectual disabilities, autism, etc. Very few case reports have reported association of eating ice cubes with compulsive behavior or depressive disorders. In this case report, we present the association of pagophagia with sadness in a patient with recurrent depressive disorder. A 44-year-old female suffering from depressive disorder since the age of 33 years presented with symptoms of an intense desire to eat ice cubes that she was unable to resist and would feel better only after consumption of ice cubes or iced drinks. Initially she would consume about 250-500 g of ice cubes per day, but gradually the quantity of consumption of ice increased to about 10-12 kg of ice cubes per day. These symptoms were related to low mood and stress. The preoccupation with consumption of ice was associated with significant psychosocial dysfunction and interpersona problems with the spouse. She was managed with venlafaxine 187.5 mg/day and cognitive behavior psychotherapy (identifying her cognitive errors, generating alternative thoughts, problem solving, activity scheduling and mastery, and pleasure technique) with which her depressive symptoms improved and her pagophagia reduced significantly but did not subside completely. She learned to use alternative coping mechanisms to deal with her psychosocial stressors.",

We present the case of a 14-year-old adolescent with chronic diarrhoea and weight loss for several months. Extensive complementary analyses were performed, all being totally negative. A careful repeated clinical history revealed that the patient had a significant nicotine intake, confirmed by a urine cotinine test. Withdrawal led to a resolution of the symptomatology. Nicotine consumption in the form of nicotine replacement products among young people is increasing rapidly. Nicotine has multiple health effects, including neurological, gastrointestinal and immune adverse effects.",

Alcoholic beverages greatly affect brain function, but if they are absorbed into the blood or gradually inhibit the activity of the nervous system, alcoholic beverages greatly affect human thinking ability, which can cause children to be guilty. The effect of alcohol on crime is that alcohol abuse has a negative impact on minors. Alcoholic drinks are widely circulated and consumed by minors because there are many illegal liquor sellers who do not have official permission to sell alcoholic beverages because they are consuming alcoholic beverages. Article 300 paragraph 1 reads: (1) a maximum imprisonment of one year or a maximum fine of four thousand five hundred rupiahs; first. Any person who deliberately sells or gives intoxicating drinks to a person who appears to be drunk; Trafficking in women and trafficking of minors is punishable by imprisonment of up to six years. (2). Anyone who knowingly intoxicates a child under the age of sixteen; 3. Any person who by coercion or threat of violence forces someone to drink an intoxicating drink. Meanwhile, according to Erikson (in Alwisol, 2009), adolescence or youth is one of the stages of human development, especially at the age of 12-20 years. Any person who deliberately sells or allows an intoxicated person to drink, deliberately intoxicates a person under the age of 16 and forces him to drink, shall be punished by a maximum imprisonment of six years.",

Se consideran los efectos fisicos y psiquicos tras el consumo de Drogas. La adiccion supone la compulsion o tendencia impulsiva hacia la droga, en muchos casos como una necesidad fisica. El fenomeno de la tolerancia es el acostumbramiento a la droga de modo que el organismo necesita mayor cantidad para obtener el efecto. Las drogas se clasifican en opiaceos, alucinogenos, estimulantes, euforizantes, cannabinoides, etc. La utilizacion de drogas por las personas jovenes es un hecho frecuente, sobre todo el consumo de alcohol y marihuana. Ultimamente se ha incrementado el consumo de drogas de sintesis, lo que constituye una autentica epidemia en nuestro pais. Se ha estudiado las caracteristicas biopsicosociales por analisis de regresion. Se trata de varones, consumen alcohol y tabaco, con falta de creencias religiosas, con estado de animo negativo, con tendencias autodestructivas y sindrome de ruptura social. El tratamiento incluye detoxificacion, en el caso de los opiaceos con metadona, pero es muy importante la interaccion personal, lo que se logra en pequenas comunidades terapeuticas. Pero es fundamental una accion social para facilitar un medio ambiente propicio, con el soporte social, ya que el paro juvenil puede actuar como factor negativo, y facilitar la formacion para un trabajo adecuado. EnglishDrug dependence is considered a state of physical and psychological dependence which arises after administration of a drug. The drug itself determines the type and the extent of such dependence. Addiction means compulsion to take the drug plus evidence, in many cases, of physical need. Related to addiction is tolerance, or need to increase dosage to obtain a given effect. Drugs can be classified into opiates, hallucinogens, stimulants and euphoriants, cannabinoids, etc.. Drug use has become relatively frequent in young people, especially alcohol and marihuana consumption. In addition, drugs are often consumed in combination, being synthetic drugs a recent epidemic in Spain. Bio-psycho-social characteristics associated with drug use, as derived from a logistic regression analysis, are sex (males), alcohol and tobacco consumption, agnostic beliefs, self-destructive behavior, and social breakdown syndrome. Treatment approaches include detoxification, methadone, and personal interaction and behavior modification in small therapeutic communities. Lastly, social environments must be addressed to support social and work acceptance.",

However, despite large numbers of campaigns and interventions, thousands of young Canadians continue to initiate cigarette smoking every year. The increasing popularity of alternative tobacco products and e-cigarettes is also creating new health challenges. Research has shown that the deleterious effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke are significant and long lasting. Health care professionals have key responsibilities in preventing tobacco use among youth and their families, and need to know more about effective smoking prevention and cessation strategies. Clinicians need to integrate tobacco counselling into health assessments of teenagers and be aware of the roles that families, communities and governments can play in promoting tobacco-free environments. Information, effective strategies and opportunities for health care professionals to intervene and advocate for Canadian adolescents are discussed. Ces dernières années, le Canada a connu une diminution générale de la prévalence de tabagisme dans tous les groupes d’âge. Cependant, malgré les multiples campagnes et interventions, des milliers de jeunes Canadiens commencent encore à fumer chaque année. La popularité croissante d’autres produits du tabac et de la cigarette électronique (vapoteuse) engendre d’ailleurs de nouveaux enjeux en matière de santé.

Les professionnels de la santé ont un rôle essentiel à jouer pour prévenir le tabagisme chez les enfants, les adolescents et leur famille, et ils doivent mieux connaître les stratégies efficaces de prévention du tabagisme et d’abandon du tabac. Les cliniciens doivent intégrer les conseils sur le tabagisme à leur évaluation de santé des jeunes et être conscients du rôle des familles, des communautés et des gouvernements dans la promotion de milieux sans tabac.

Presentation of an aversive conditioned stimulus suppressed drug seeking in rats with limited cocaine self-administration experience, but no longer did so after an extended cocaine-taking history. In contrast, after equivalent extended sucrose experience, sucrose seeking was still suppressed by an aversive conditioned stimulus. Persistent cocaine seeking in the presence of signals of environmental adversity after a prolonged cocaine-taking history was not due to impaired fear conditioning, nor to an increase in the incentive value of cocaine, and may reflect the establishment of compulsive behavior.",

      "title": "Food Addiction and Eating Addiction",
      "abstract": "There is a growing view that certain foods, particularly those high in refined sugars and fats, may be addictive and that some forms of obesity may be treated as food addictions. This is supported by an expanding body of evidence from animal studies, human neuroscience, and brain imaging. Obese and overweight individuals also display patterns of eating behavior that resemble the ways in which addicted individuals consume drugs. Scientific and clinical questions remain: Is addiction a valid explanation of excess weight? Is food addiction a behavioural (i.e., eating) or substance (i.e., sugar) addiction, or a complex interaction of both? Should obesity be treated as a food addiction? Should we distinguish food addiction from other forms of disordered eating like Binge Eating Disorder? It is also unclear what impact food addiction explanations might have on the way in which we think about or treat people who are overweight: What impact will a food addiction diagnosis have on individuals' internalised weight-bias, stigma, and self-efficacy? Should some foods be regulated like other addictive commodities (i.e., alcohol and tobacco), whose advertising and sale is restricted, or like certain foods, which are taxed? This Special Issue addresses questions raised by the concept of food addiction.",

      "abstract": "Nalmefene modulates the motivational system by blocking the opioids receptors. Nalmefene indication is the alcohol consumption reduction in alcoho dependent patients. We describe the case of a patient with weekend alcohol abuse that was followed by cocaine use and sex. After being treated with nalmefene, the patient decreased alcohol consumption and did not engage cocaine use and sex. The patient is a 36-year-old man with a previous history of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol abuse. After detoxification the patient became a weekend drinker. Two months later he started complaining that after drinking he needed to consume cocaine and this led him to having sex with prostitutes. These behaviours had a serious impact on his finances that lead him to asking for help. Nalmefene, 18 mg at dinner before going out, was prescribed. Taking one pill of nalmefene “allowed me to drink several shots without feeling a need to continue drinking and, most importantly, I didn’t feel the need to consume cocaine and have sex”. In an attempt to ascertain if what had happened the previous weekend was “psychological” the patient went out without taking nalmefene. The pattern of alcohol use, control loss, and consumption of cocaine and sex repeated itself. During the following two months, the patient took nalmefene during dinner before going out every weekend and the results were the same as when he first took the treatment. Conclusion Nalmefene may be helpful in the treatment of several other addictions by blocking the positive reinforcements of the drugs.

      "title": "Commentary on Brose <i>et al</i>. (2015): Protecting individual and public health by regulating electronic cigarette nicotine delivery",
      "abstract": "Brose and colleagues 1 used a national data set from Great Britain to demonstrate that, in current tobacco cigarette smokers, daily but not non-daily electronic cigarette (e-cig) use shows a significant association with increased tobacco smoking cessation attempts and reductions in smoking behavior. However, e-cig use was not shown in this study to be associated significantly with tobacco smoking cessation. Taken together, this new study 1 and the extant literature (e.g. 2, 3) provide little empirical support for the contention that e-cig use leads reliably to smoking cessation for the majority of users. Tobacco cigarette smokers self-administer the stimulant drug nicotine with every puff that they inhale, and most of them are dependent on the drug 4. This dependence makes cessation difficult, in part because of an aversive abstinence syndrome that occurs during a cessation attempt (e.g. 5). Nicotine replacement medications act by delivering nicotine to the user and thus suppressing at least some aversive abstinence symptoms: the more nicotine, the greater the symptom suppression (e.g. 6). E-cigs are not marketed as medications in many countries, but are a class of products that use an electric heater to aerosolize a liquid that usually contains some combination of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavorants and nicotine. Despite not being marketed as medications, many smokers are attempting to quit tobacco cigarettes by using e-cigs daily; however, there is little information regarding the long-term health risks associated with daily e-cig use. Putting aside that concern, if daily e-cig use is to lead to smoking cessation for the majority of users, then e-cigs will probably need to deliver nicotine in doses necessary to suppress abstinence symptoms as effectively as a tobacco cigarette. Unfortunately, there is wide variability in e-cig nicotine delivery: 10 puffs from an e-cig may, for example 7, or may not 8, result in reliable nicotine delivery to the user's blood. Differences across studies can be explained by a combination of factors, including characteristics of the e-cig device and liquid, as well as user behavior 9. Those e-cig device/liquid combinations that are most likely to lead to smoking cessation may well be those that approximate the nicotine delivery profile of a tobacco cigarette (e.g. 10). Strangely, e-cigs that are far less effective at delivering nicotine continue to be marketed to smokers. For instance, 50 puffs from either of two Blu e-cig (Lorillard, Inc., Greensboro, NC, USA) models that are currently available on the US market deliver 23–53% less nicotine to the user relative to approximately 10 puffs from a conventional tobacco cigarette 11, yet Blu e-cig brands are rated as the most popular among US young adults 12. Perhaps relatedly, more than 80% of all US televised e-cig advertisements geared toward youth and young adults were for Blu e-cigs 13, and 90% of all US advertising expenditures for e-cig brands have been for Blu E e-cigs 14. The fact that some e-cigs that are advertised to youth and young adults actively also deliver very little nicotine is reminiscent of so-called ‘starter products’ common in the smokeless tobacco arena 15. Starter products allow nicotine-naive users to self-administer low doses of nicotine without experiencing drug-mediated adverse side effects and then, as tolerance develops, these users can ‘graduate’ to products that deliver increasing doses of the drug (e.g. 15). Public health policy-makers may want to recall this industry strategy when considering regulatory action regarding e-cigs. Further complicating this issue is that at least 466 distinct brands of e-cigs are marketed currently 16, some by major tobacco companies. Tobacco companies in particular may be interested in smokers who purchase an e-cig as part of a smoking cessation strategy but, as Brose et al.’s 1 data suggest, ultimately do not quit smoking, perhaps because the e-cig they bought underperforms a tobacco cigarette in terms of nicotine delivery to the user. Under this scenario, the tobacco company that sells the under-performing product profits from sales of e-cigs and tobacco cigarettes, while the smoker who purchased the under-performing product in addition to tobacco cigarettes continues to be at risk for tobacco-caused disease and death. Much has been written about the potential for e-cigs to provide public health benefit through a dramatic reduction in tobacco cigarette smoking (e.g. 17). This potential benefit may require science-based regulatory intervention to ensure that e-cigs deliver nicotine effectively to cigarette smokers, while avoiding e-cig-induced nicotine dependence in non-smokers via the starter product strategy. Also, some e-cig device/liquid combinations on the market today may deliver nicotine more effectively than the highly addictive tobacco cigarette 18; there is no clear public health rationale for such products, and regulation can help to limit their availability. Relevant foci for regulatory intervention that address drug delivery include product characteristics 9 and nicotine flux 19. Without meaningful, science-based regulation, there may be many future opportunities to report, as do Brose et al. 1, that e-cigs are not effective tools for helping the majority of smokers to quit using lethal tobacco cigarettes.

De hábito en los años 60, el consumo pasó a ser considerado como dependencia psicológica en los años 70, después como adicción en los 80 y en los años 90 se instauró la clínica del fumador. Para entender el mecanismo del hábito de fumar debemos considerar que fumar representa mucho más que la dependencia física a la nicotina. Con el paso del tiempo el fumador pasa a recibir estímulos sociales, comportamentales o culturales que refuerzan su hábito y probablemente serán los elementos causantes del establecimiento de la dependencia psicológica.

Los inhalantes son un grupo variado de sustancias volatiles, cuyos vapores quimicos se inhalan para producir efectos psicoactivos (alteracion mental). Debido a su accesibilidad, se tiende a considerar que son sustancias poco lesivas, pero en realidad se asocian a efectos negativos muy importantes sobre la salud de los que los consumen. Diversos factores, como la delincuencia, la personalidad antisocial, el hecho de tener una familia de origen desestructurada, ser “ninos de la calle”, o presentar comorbilidad con otros trastornos mentales se han asociado con el desarrollo de problemas de abuso o dependencia de inhalantes entre los mas jovenes. Se requiere un mayor esfuerzo investigador para aumentar el actual conocimiento sobre el consumo de inhalantes, y para implementar tratamientos que actuen sobre estos trastornos y sus consecuencias biopsicosociales. EnglishThe prevalence rates of inhalant use among adolescents highlight a serious and under studied problem until date. Inhalants are a diverse group of volatile substances whose chemical vapors can be inhaled to produce psychoactive (mind-altering) effects. Because of its accessibility inhalants could be considered harmless, but in fact they are harmfully and have been related to negative effects on consumers’ health. Factors such as crime, antisocial personality, to grow up in a dysfunctional family, to be a “street child”, or the presence of comorbid mental disorders, have been associated with the development of inhalant use disorders among young people. A stronger effort is needed to conduct inhalants abuse research in order to increase the present knowledge, and to implement interventions for these disorders and its biopsychosocial implications.",

Nontherapeutic use of psychoactive drugs poses an important danger to individual persons and society. What are the quantitative estimates of these risks? Are they acceptable?Because the basic mechanism of the toxic effect of alcohol or other drugs is unknown, deciding on acceptable risks is difficult. Based on current information, the recreational abuse of inhalants, hallucinogens, stimulants, narcotics and sedative-hypnotic drugs poses unacceptable individual and societal risks. Groups at special risk should not consume alcohol or any drug unless they are under medical supervision. The threshold for increased morbidity from the regular use of alcohol in adults is in the range of three to five drinks per day; this rises sharply after six drinks per day. The apparent \"safe\" level of alcohol consumption appears to be one to two drinks per day. Further basic studies are required to refine these risk estimates.",

Complications are rare but can be severe and may include injury to the esophagus, trachea, laryngeal nerve, or adjacent structures. More than 97% of battery ingestion cases have mild effects or none at all.",

      "title": "Reducing polypharmacy in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Why is it so hard to stop medications? Pharmacists see it all the time—elderly patients taking 15, 20, sometimes 25 medications. Pill burden can be as high as 60 doses per day. Patients are unsure of the reasons for medications, take them haphazardly and often have other medications added to treat side effects. They tell us they hate taking these drugs. Family doctors express frustration, sometimes inheriting an elderly patient with little medication history and struggling to keep up with changes made during multiple hospital admissions or specialist visits. They feel pressured by various clinical guidelines to start medications, aren’t sure what a patient is actually taking, may have difficulty distinguishing symptoms from side effects, but don’t have a ready-made solution to the problem.1\r\n\r\nPolypharmacy is variously defined as high numbers of medications (e.g., more than 5-10), use of more drugs than clinically indicated or use of inappropriate medications. In 2009, 63% of Canadian seniors were taking more than 5 medications, and 30% of those older than 85 years were taking more than 10. The prevalence is even higher for those living in long-term care.2\r\n\r\nThe impact of polypharmacy on our elderly population is significant. It is associated with poor adherence, drug-drug interactions, medication errors and adverse drug reactions—including falls, hip fractures, confusion and delirium—accounting for a significant percentage of potentially preventable emergency room visits and hospitalization.3,4\r\n\r\nBut interventions to reduce medication use are not consistently used. There are consensus-developed screening criteria for inappropriate medications, as well as algorithms and acronyms to help health care professionals conduct medication reviews to identify drug-related problems.5 However, there is little guidance with regard to how to implement suggested changes to reduce medication use. Many prescribers are reluctant to make such changes, often fearing adverse drug withdrawal events,6 and say they do not want to “rock the boat.”\r\n\r\nIn the Geriatric Day Hospital of Bruyere Continuing Care, our elderly patients often have multiple issues such as cognitive impairment, falls, pain and deconditioning. They attend twice weekly for functional assessment and rehabilitation with an interprofessional team. Patients referred for medication review are typically taking 15 medications per day and have an average of 9 drug-related problems.7 We see prescribing cascades (in which a medication has been started to treat a side effect of another medication) and adverse effects of drugs on multiple systems, including hypotension, impaired cognition and balance problems. One by one, over a 10- to 12-week admission, we taper and stop those medications for which we have little evidence for continued use and those that might be contributing to adverse effects. We focus on reducing pill burden, facilitating independent medication management, furthering knowledge and understanding of medication use and communicating changes clearly. The outcome can be amazing. We’ve seen patients demonstrate significant improvement in symptoms with reduction in medication.\r\n\r\nFrustrated with the never-ending supply of patients suffering with polypharmacy, and the lack of broadly implemented clinical guidance to reduce polypharmacy, we have developed a series of case reports about polypharmacy in the elderly that demonstrate the strategies we employ to reduce medication use in our patients. Identifying drug-related problems, prioritizing them, using tapering approaches, monitoring for adverse drug-withdrawal events, reducing pill burden and appropriately using compliance strategies are demonstrated throughout these cases. As an interprofessional team, each member plays a role in helping to reduce medication use and monitor the effects. We have therefore designed the case reports so they can be used for interprofessional education in geriatric pharmacotherapy. The series is planned for the Canadian Pharmacists Journal, Canadian Family Physician and the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Each case will link to online resources to facilitate interprofessional discussion.\r\n\r\nWe hope pharmacists and other health care professionals will find the strategies in this series supportive of their own efforts to reduce polypharmacy. With recent regulatory and remuneration changes, pharmacists are even better placed to actively participate in optimizing therapy in the elderly.8 We hope those who develop clinical guidelines will take note and consider how they might include “deprescribing” guidelines to further support tapering and stopping of medications when evidence is limited or when pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters affecting medication distribution and effectiveness change with age.8\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank the Bruyere Academic Medical Organization for its support, our colleagues in the Geriatric Day Hospital of Bruyere Continuing Care for their collaboration and our patients who willingly work with us to taper their medications, particularly the many patients who enthusiastically agreed to share their stories. We hope you enjoy the series and welcome your comments and feedback. ■",

      "title": "HUBUNGAN TINGKAT KECEMASAN DENGAN PERILAKU MEROKOK MAHASISWA TEKNIK ANGKATAN 2011 DI FAKULTAS TEKNIK UNIVERSITAS ANDALAS",
      "abstract": "Menurut Istiqomah perilaku merokok adalah tindakan menyalakan api\r\npada rokok atau cerutu atau tembakau dalam pipa rokok yang kemudian dihisap\r\nuntuk mendapatkan efek dari zat yang ada dalam rokok tersebut yang dinilai\r\nberdasarkan intensitas rokok yang dihisap (Satria, 2014). Menurut komalasari &\r\nhelmi dalam bambang (2015) perilaku merokok dapat juga didefnisikan sebagai\r\naktivitas subjek yang berhubungan dengan perilaku merokoknya, yang diukur\r\nmelalui intensitas merokok, waktu merokok, dan fungsi merokok dalam\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Menurut Aditama (2002), perilaku merokok adalah\r\naktivitas menghisap atau menghirup asap rokok dengan menggunakan pipa atau\r\nrokok. Rokok merupakan zat adiktif yang dapat membahayakan kesehatan\r\nindividu atau masyarakat yang mengkonsumsinya.\r\nMeningkatnya prevalensi merokok menyebabkan masalah rokok semakin\r\nmenjadi serius. Jumlah perokok di dunia mencapai 1,35 miliar orang. Di US di\r\nperkirakan perokok remaja sebanyak 4,5 juta orang. Diantara remaja yang\r\nmerokok menghabiskan 100 batang rokok selama hidupnya, mereka mengatakan\r\ningin berhenti merokok tapi tidak bisa. Saat ini pada 3,800 remaja ≤ 18 tahun\r\nmemulai merokok untuk pertama kali sedangkan 850 lainnya mulai\r\nmengkonsumsi rokok sehari-hari (CDC, 2012).\r\nIndonesia merupakan negara berkembang yang mengalami pertambahan\r\npenduduk yang sangat pesat. Hal ini mengakibatkan banyak sekali masalah yang\r\ntimbul, terutama permasalah yang berkaitan dengan kesehatan tersebut,\r\npemerintah membuat rumusan MDGS yang salah satunya adalah mengendalikan\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria, dan penyakit menular lainnya. Salah satu penyakit menular\r\ntersebut ialah TB yang salah satu faktor resikonya adalah merokok (sedyaningsih,\r\n2010).\r\nIndonesia menduduki peringkat kelima dalam konsumsi rokok dunia yaitu\r\n181.958 milyar batang rokok dalam satu tahun, setelah jepang yang menduduki\r\nperingkat ke empat, yang menghabiskan 299,085 milyar batang rokok dalam satu\r\ntahun sementara peringkat ke tiga adalah rusia yang menghabiskan 375.000\r\nmilyar batang rokok dalam satu tahun, dan peringkat pertama adalah china yang\r\njuga sebagai salah satu negara dengan padat penduduk yang menduduki peringkat\r\npertma yang mampu menghabiskan 1.697.291 milyar batang rokok dalam satu\r\ntahun (Tjandra, 2011).\r\nDi negara-negara berkembang seperti Indonesia jumlah perokok dari\r\nwaktu ke waktu semakin meningkat. Pada tahun 1994 prevalensi perokok\r\npenduduk ≥ 15 tahun adalah 26,9%. Pada tahun 2001 meningkat menjadi 31,5%.\r\nPada tahun 2010 meningkat menjadi 34,2% (Riskesdas, 2013). Di Indonesia\r\nproporsi perokok aktif umur 15-19 tahun adalah 11,2 % sedangkan proporsi\r\nperokok umur 20-24 tahun adalah 27, 2%. Dari data WHO terhadap perilaku\r\nmerokok di Indonesia memperlihatkan prevalensi perokok laki-laki lebih tinggi\r\ndari pada perokok wanita, yaitu perokok laki-laki sebanyak 64% dari jumlah\r\npenduduk laki-laki sedangkan perokok wanita sebanyak 2,1% dari penduduk\r\nwanita. Menurut penelitian Global Adults Tobacco Survey (GATS) pada\r\npenduduk kelompok umur ≥15 tahun, proporsi perokok laki-laki sebanyak 67,0 %\r\nsedangkan perempuan sebanyak 2,7% (riskesdas 2013). Provinsi Sumatera Barat\r\nurutan kedelapan dari seluruh provinsi di Indonesia dengan perokok aktif setiap\r\nhari sebanyak 26,4 % dari jumlah penduduk yang ada di Sumatera Barat dan\r\nperokok kadang-kadang sebanyak 3,9% dari seluruh penduduk di Sumatera barat\r\n(riskesdas 2013).\r\nMenurut survey menemukan 16 % mahasiswa melapor merokok selama\r\nsebulan terakhir dan prevalensi mahasiswa merokok juga termasuk tinggi yaitu\r\n24,5 % sampai 28, % (CDC, 2012). Banyak faktor yangmempengaruhi perilaku\r\nmerokok salah satunya menurut Sabanada (Ayuningtyas, 2011) yaitu faktor\r\npsikiatrik, adanya kecemasan. individu yang memperlihatkan gejala cemas\r\nmempunyai resiko yang lebih tinggi untuk memulai rokok daripada individu yang\r\ntidak mengalami kecemasan. Mahasiswa yang mengalami cemas akan sering\r\nmerokok karena mereka menganggap dengan melakukan hal ini akan membuat\r\npikiran tenang dan rileks (Nasution, 2007).\r\nKecemasan adalah perasaan takut, gelisah, ragu-ragu akibat ancaman\r\nnyata atau dirasakan (Varcarolis & Halter, 2010). Kecemasan merupakan aspek\r\nyang selalu ada dan menjadi bagian dari kehidupan. Menurut Hawari (2008)\r\ngejala-gejala yang ditunjukkan oleh orang yang mengalami kecemasan dapat\r\nbersifat fisik (somatik) maupun psikis. Gejala muncul secara fisik antara lain, rasa\r\nsakit pada otot dan tulang, pendengaran berdenging (tinitus), berdebar-debar,\r\nsesak nafas, gangguan pencernaan, gangguan perkemihan, sakit kepala dan lain\r\nsebagainya. Gejala yang bersifat psikis antara lain merasa takut, khawatir, firasat\r\nburuk takut akan pikirannya sendiri, mudah tersinggung, gangguan konsentrasi,\r\ngangguan pola tidur, takut sendirian, tidak tenang, gelisah, merasa tegang, mudah\r\nterkejut. Beberapa gejala-gejala ini banyak terlihat pada mahasiswa yang tingkat\r\nakhir. Kecemasan dalam mengerjakan tugas akhir adalah respon emosional\r\nindividu yang dapat menimbulkan persaaan yang tidak berdaya dan tidak nyaman\r\ndalam menyelesaikan tugas akhir.\r\nFakultas Teknik Universitas Andalas adalah salah satu fakultas di\r\nuniversitas andalas yang memiliki lima jurusan yaitu teknik mesin, teknik industri,\r\nteknik lingkungan, teknik civil, dan teknik elektro. Mahasiswanya yang dominan\r\nadalah mahasiswa laki-laki dan dari kaum minoritas adalah mahasiswi\r\nperempuan. Menurut penelitian Bambang (2015) mengenai gambaran perilaku\r\nmerokok di fakultas teknik universitas andalas mengatakan bahwa fakultas teknik\r\nmemiliki angka perokok aktif yang tinggi. Dan motif merokok adalah 37 %\r\nkarena pengaruh lingkungan, 23% untuk mengurangi kecemasan atau rasa bosan,\r\n25% karena kebiasaan, 25 merasa kenikmatan dan relaksasi, 52% karena tidak\r\nmerokok sulit untuk berkonsentrasi. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian dari Gunawan\r\nmengatakan adanya hubungan yang signifikan antara tingkat kecemasan dengan\r\nperilaku merokok dengan p value p= 0,000.\r\nBerdasarkan survey awal yang dilakukan oleh peneliti pada 10 orang\r\nmahasiswa teknik angkatan 2010 di fakultas teknik universitas andalas didapatkan\r\n4 orang mahasiswa mengalami kecemasan ringan, 5 orang mengalami kecemasan\r\nsedang dan 1 orang mengalami kecemasan berat. Mahasiswa yang mengalami\r\nkecemasan ringan mengalami gejala tidak tenang, gelisah, dan mudah marah.\r\nKecemasan edang yang dialami oleh 5 orang mahasiswa mengatakan mengalami\r\ngejala ketegangan, sakit kepala, mual, pusing dan mimpi buruk. Sedangkan 1 oran\r\nyang mengalami kecemasan berat mengalami gejala takut akan fikiran sendiri,\r\nlesu, gelisah, insomnia, kurang nafsu makan, jantung berdebar-debar. Dari 10\r\nmahasiswa teknik tersebut, 9 mahasiswa mengatakan merokok dalam satu bulan\r\nterakhir dan alasan yang di paparkan diantaranya untuk meningkatkan\r\nkonsentrasi, mengurangi rasa bosan, mengurangi kecemasan dan merokok bisa\r\nmembuat rileks. Melihat penjelasan di atas, hal ini membuat peneliti tertarik untuk\r\nmeneliti “hubungan tingkat kecemasan dengan perilaku merokok mahasiswa\r\nTeknik Angkatan 2011 di Fakultas Teknik Universitas Andalas”.",

One hundred-nine adults completed a cross-sectional study examining disordered eating, EDs, and alcohol use. Based on “tendency to abuse alcohol” frequency, drinking was dichotomized into misuse or non-misuse and examined as a predictor of disordered eating and EDs. Sixteen (14.7%) reported alcohol misuse and had significantly higher drive for thinness, anxiety associated with specific foods, frequent dieting, feelings of guilt/shame with eating, and binge eating disorder (BED) than non-misusers. Alcohol misuse may be associated with disordered eating and BED, warranting larger studies and screening efforts.",

      "title": "TOBACCO: POLICING AND SOCIAL POLICY",
      "abstract": "Tobacco has exercised the interest of the nation since Elizabethan times, and the inhalation of its smoke for pleasure has become very widespread. It was not until the mid‐twentieth century, however, that its effects upon health were suspected. It is now widely accepted that tobacco smoke is implicated in a range of dangerous diseases, although the tobacco industry sometimes argues that the link is not proven. The arguments about the conflicting needs of a large, world‐wide industry and the health and prosperity of individuals and society are complex, and often influenced by conflicting vested interests. Government's involvement in the issues is further complicated by its reliance upon large tobacco revenues. The link between advertising and increased smoking, either by existing or new smokers, is not proved by research, although there are strong indications that it exists. The behaviour of most parties involved, including the tobacco companies, indicates that they share the belief of a link. Voluntary controls upon tobacco advertising have had some effect, in that, for example, advertising in the U.K. is no longer overtly directed at children, but various anti‐smoking lobbies believe voluntary control to be ineffective. The present British government has toyed wth the possibility of statutory control, but faces stiff opposition from back‐benchers and within the cabinet; it is also probably philosophically opposed to such measures. More research is needed into the link between advertising and smoking behaviour.",

      "title": "Extinction Burst after Varenicline Titration: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Background: The mechanism of action of varenicline as a partial agonist may make it useful for cigarette reduction as smokers experience reduced craving and withdrawal at the same time their cigarettes provide reduced reinforcement value. Case Description: The current case report describes a 51-year-old African American woman using varenicline to reduce her cigarette use. After making a substantial reduction in cigarettes per day (from 25 to 8), the patient unexpectedly began smoking considerably more (from 8 to 20) after 11 days treatment with varenicline. Conclusions: The temporary increase in smoking while taking varenicline was likely the result of an ‘extinction burst’ where the extinction of a reward (e.g., nicotine's rewarding effects after smoking a cigarette) was temporarily associated with an increase in the behaviour usually associated with the reward (e.g., smoking a cigarette). Once explaining to her that no amount of cigarettes would overcome the feeling of reduced reward she likely felt while taking varenicline, she was able to reduce her smoking again.",

In India, there are plenty of options for smoking and smokeless tobacco, including jarda, pan masala, gutka, bidi, and cigarettes. Every year, tobacco usage claims the lives of almost six millions individuals globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tobacco smoking caused 100 million premature deaths worldwide in the 20th century. If present tobacco use rates continue, this number is predicted to climb to 1 billion in India in the 21st century. For a variety of reasons, including peer pressure, stress, alleviation, sadness, and social media ads advocating smoking, people begin to smoke or chew tobacco. The lower socioeconomic classes like and prefer tobacco more than other drugs because it is more affordable and readily available. One tobacco addicted patient tried to quit chewing tobacco, but as withdrawal symptoms, he reported having headaches, indigestion, anorexia, anxiety and body aches. The patient was treated with powder of Punarnava (Boerhavia diffusa Linn.), Sheerisha( Albizzia lebbeck L.) and Sarpagandha (Rauwolfia serpentine L.) ghana vati for his withdrawal symptoms.

      "title": "[Why stopping smoking is difficult in patients suffering from schizophrenia? How better to take care of them?]",
      "abstract": "Smoking is much higher among patients suffering from schizophrenia compared to the general population. These patients inhale the smoke more deeply and extract a significant amount of nicotine from the cigarette. They are highly addicted to tobacco and their attempts to stop smoking are more frequently marked by failures. The continuation of consumption exposes them particularly to the risk of diseases and mortality related to smoking. Various hypotheses are advanced to explain the association between schizophrenia and tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke and/or nicotine appear to compensate for certain cognitive deficits due to the disease or to correct adverse events of anti-psychotics. Furthermore, genetic factors, personality traits and socio-cultural factors appear to be jointly implicated in mental illness and smoking. Smoking cessation, which does not aggravate schizophrenia, combines psycho-social approaches and medication treatments; it can be helped by the use of the electronic cigarette and the practice of physical exercise. Professionals must ensure long-term personalized follow-up.La consommation de tabac est beaucoup plus élevée parmi les patients souffrant de schizophrénie comparativement à la population générale. Ces patients inhalent plus profondément la fumée et extraient une importante quantité de nicotine de la cigarette. Ils présentent une forte dépendance tabagique et leurs tentatives d’arrêt du tabac sont plus fréquemment marquées par des échecs. La poursuite de la consommation les expose particulièrement au risque de maladies et de mortalité en lien avec le tabagisme. Diverses hypothèses sont avancées pour expliquer l’association entre la schizophrénie et le tabagisme : le tabagisme et/ou la nicotine paraissent compenser certains déficits cognitifs dus à la maladie ou corriger des événements indésirables des anti-psychotiques. De plus, des facteurs génétiques, des traits de personnalité et des facteurs sociaux culturels paraissent conjointement impliqués dans la maladie mentale et l’usage du tabac. Le sevrage tabagique qui n’aggrave pas la maladie associe les prises en charge psycho-sociales et les médicaments d’aide à l’arrêt; il peut être aidé par l’usage de la cigarette électronique et la pratique de l’exercice physique. Les professionnels doivent assurer un suivi personnalisé de longue durée.",

Smokers mostly acknowledge the harm they are doing to themselves and many report that they do not enjoy it – yet they continue to smoke. Smoking behavior is maintained primarily by the positive and negative reinforcing properties of nicotine delivered rapidly in a way that is affordable and palatable, with the negative health consequences mostly being sufficiently uncertain and distant in time not to create sufficient immediate concern to deter the behavior. Tobacco smoking increases the risk of contracting a wide range of diseases, many of which are fatal. Despite reductions in prevalence in recent years, tobacco smoking remains one of the main preventable causes of ill-health and premature death worldwide.

      "title": "Bulimia and parotid swelling: A review and case report",
      "abstract": "Bulimia, or “ox hunger,” is characterized by episodes of binge eating, during which there is a large intake of food over a short time span, followed by induced vomiting and occasionally periods of fasting. Classically, the problem starts in a teenage female who perceives herself as being too fat. As a result, the person develops feelings of guilt and low self-esteem.‘,’ An attempt at dieting leads to some weight loss and simultaneous hunger. In the susceptible individual, this hunger results in an eating binge. To counter the effect of the weight gain from the eating binge, self-induced vomiting is initiated. Once the individual realizes that the weight gain caused by the binge can be nullified by vomiting, less restraint is exerted on the binges. A natural progression is for the person to resort to binges not only when hungry, but also when tense or anxious.3 Vomiting is usually carried out in secret, and often with the aid of the emetic ipecac. Laxatives and diuretics frequently become adjunctive agents. Although bulimics may binge and vomit as little as twice a week, the frequency varies and it can become as high as 140 episodes each week.3-6 The average intake of food is 3,400 calories in a 1.2-hour period, with some patients ingesting as much as 50,000 calories in a 24hour period.5 Casper3 characterized the three major manifestations of bulimia nervosa as recurrent episodes of binge eating with an awareness on the patient’s part that the pattern is abnormal, the presence of depressed moods, and the absence of any known physical disorder. In addition, at least three of the following are present: high-calorie intake during the binge, inconspicuous eating during the binge, self-induced vomiting at the end of the binge, repeated attempts to lose weight through dieting and",

      "title": "Blood pressure up in a puff of smoke",
      "abstract": "We should begin by stating that it may not matter whether smoking tobacco products, either directly inhaling or indirectly from the environment, increases blood pressure (BP). Proof that it does will only add to a litany of other reasons why smoking is bad for vascular health and these are already sufficient to support major public health campaigns that are reaping huge benefits around the world [1–3]. Direct or active smoking has been tried, convicted and sentenced as a major cause of death and disability from cardiovascular and other diseases. The effects on BP are not simple, however. Blowing tobacco smoke in the face or the respiratory tract of an experimental animal is a sure way of eliciting an acute stress response [4]. The neural pathways are well established and this technique has contributed much to our knowledge of the pathophysiology of stress. Habitual smokers, however, are reported to have slightly lower BP than nonsmokers, perhaps because they tend to be lean, although a cigarette will elicit a transient pressor response [2,5]. Indeed, different conclusions on the BP effects of smoking have been derived from epidemiological surveys as compared with experimental studies. Experimental evidence is available that cigarette smoking induces an acute rise in BP and in plasma catecholamine levels [6–12]. The increase in BP seems to persist during repeated smoking. In a study by Groppelli et al.[10,11], carried out in 10 normotensive smokers asked to smoke one cigarette every 15 min for 1 h, BP and heart rate were continuously monitored during the smoking period and during the preceding nonsmoking hour through a Finapres device (TNO, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). In six other normotensive smokers asked to smoke two cigarettes per hour throughout the day, BP and heart rate were monitored noninvasively in ambulatory conditions for 8 h during daytime. BP monitoring was repeated during a nonsmoking day. Ambulatory BP and heart rate were measured once every 10 min to study the BP effects of repeated cigarette smoking in details. In resting conditions, the first cigarette caused an immediate and marked increase in BP and heart rate, and the peak BP and heart rate achieved were similar for the remaining three cigarettes. In each instance, the hemodynamic effects were so prolonged that throughout the smoking hour, BP and heart rate were persistently higher than during the nonsmoking hour [11]. The SDs of SBP and DBP and heart rate were also higher during the smoking hour, indicating an increase in BP and heart rate variability. In the six ambulant smokers, daytime BP and heart rate were also persistently higher during smoking than during nonsmoking. The authors concluded [11] that heavy smoking is associated with a persistent rise in BP and also with an increase in BP variability and that these effects (which may escape recognition during an office visit as office BP measurements are performed during nonsmoking) may account for some of the smoking-related cardiovascular risk. Few years later, these findings were confirmed by Verdecchia et al.[13], who found that, although clinic BP was nearly identical in smokers and nonsmokers (158/99 versus 158/98 mmHg), daytime ambulatory BP was significantly higher in the smokers than in the nonsmokers (150/97 versus 143/93 mmHg), whereas night-time BP did not differ between the two groups (129/79 versus 126/78 mmHg). Smokers had a higher heart rate over 24 hours, but not at the time of clinic visits. On the contrary, in many epidemiological studies, BP was reported to be comparable or even lower in smokers than in nonsmokers [14–16]. Such a discrepancy between the results of experimental studies on the direct effect of smoking on BP and the BP data derived from epidemiological observations in smokers might be explained not only by the fact that in the latter case at the time of BP measurement participants were required to stop smoking for a period ranging from at least 30 min to hours, but also by the lower body weight usually found in smokers as compared with nonsmokers, which, in turn, is associated with lower BP levels. Controversial data are available also on the effects of passive smoking on BP. To say that passive, second hand, environmental or indirect smoking (the terms will be used interchangeably) is under a cloud is both a poor pun and an understatement [17]. The circumstantial case is very strong for vascular damage through a broad range of pathways. Nevertheless, the 'killer' piece of experimental evidence is lacking. Passive smoking is difficult to quantify outside of the laboratory and the influences are likely to be different if exposure occurs at critical times of development, at differing intensity, frequency and proximity. We do not know the shape, threshold or linearity dose–response relationship in free-living humans; these are likely to vary according to the biological response in question. Passive smoking is easily considered as a lighter form of exposure to the toxic effects of tobacco smoking. Like so-called 'light' cigarettes; however, this is misleading and indeed there is a case that passive smoking may be more harmful based on the relative exposure to main stream and side stream smoke [18]. Main stream smoke is what the smoker inhales and exhales and makes up about 15% of the smoke exposure of a passive smoker. The remainder is produced at the tip of the cigarette and contains a higher concentration, in some cases, an order of magnitude more of many of the toxins associated with cigarette smoke. As mentioned above, the dose–effect relationship for indirect smoking is difficult to establish in humans and it has been proposed that the threshold is such that even minimal amounts of exposure produce maximal vascular damage [17,19]. Estimates of the excess risk of coronary disease in passive smokers as a proportion of the excess in active smokers vary from almost 40 to almost 100%. Passive smokers at home have about one-third greater risk of cardiovascular death than those living in smoke-free homes. The mechanisms may include reprogramming in infancy [20], impairment of endothelial function [21], platelet function changes favouring aggregation [22], reduction in circulating endothelial progenitor cells number and/or function [18] and sympathetic overactivity [23], a possibility supported also by the evidence that cigarette smoking is associated with a reduced arterial baroreflex sensitivity [24]. All of these effects have been observed in passive smokers, at least after acute exposure and in most cases in the chronic situation. The adverse effects seem to be present in both the indolent stages of atherosclerosis progression and the acute stage associated with plaque disruption and sudden cardiac death. What about the effects of indirect smoking on BP? Stroke rates are consistently higher in those exposed regularly, often an indicator of an effect on BP [25]. Maternal smoking has been reported to increase cardiovascular reactivity in general in infants, including BP responses to environmental stimuli suggesting some programming changes in reflex centres involved in BP control [20]. In fact, the evidence for enhanced sympathetic nervous responses is perhaps better for passive than for direct smoke inhalation. Makris et al. [26] have reported ambulatory BP measurements in a subgroup of hypertension clinic patients who were found to have normal clinic BP on presentation. Those who were passive smokers had a number of characteristics that differed from those not generally exposed to tobacco smoke. They were younger, dietary assessment suggested a less healthy diet, they consumed more alcohol and more of them had hypertension on ambulatory BP measurement. This raises two possibilities. First, passive smoking may be no more than a marker of a less healthy environment and personal habits. The finding of normal clinic BP and high BP during daily activities, termed masked hypertension, in this group also raises the possibility that the short or perhaps long wait for an appointment in a smoke-free clinic environment was sufficient for the effects of passive smoking on BP to wear off, as suggested for the effects of active smoking. More detailed ambulatory BP studies in controlled environments with measurement of cotinine or other markers would help resolve this question. In the present issue, Seki et al. [27] provide another piece of the jigsaw from the well conducted Ohasama study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to classify participants into those with no exposure, exposure at home, exposure in the workplace and exposure in both the workplace and at home. Self-administered questionnaires of smoking exposure have known limitations, and it would have been wise to combine these with biomarker measurements if anything more than a qualitative assessment is sought. The main finding was a consistent association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and SBP, when this occurred at home or both at home and at work. It was not seen in those taking antihypertensive therapy and was also not evident in those exposed only at work or elsewhere, a curious finding that demands further examination. Although some of the measurements at different times of the day were not significantly different between those exposed or not exposed to environmental smoke, there seemed to be about 3 mmHg difference in SBP. This is a novel study in the use of home BP, whereas much of the previous literature has been based on occasional clinic measurements. Some selection occurred and not surprisingly the groups were not well matched in some variables. Particularly, the only group of similar age to the control nonexposed group were those exposed at home. There was also a large difference in the proportion of those taking alcohol between the control and the other groups. The relationship to BP persisted when these differences were taken into account in the statistical analysis. The other variable related to the level of exposure is its intensity. There may be a great difference in response between someone who is exposed to a workmate who has one cigarette per day, compared with another worker who is surrounded by chain smokers, even though both would have been categorized as having exposure every day. In conclusion, if we needed yet another reason to pursue the elimination of tobacco smoking in the community, we may have one in a possible effect not only of active but also of passive smoking on BP. We can be comforted that if exposure cannot be eliminated, the results of the study by Seki et al. suggest that antihypertensive therapy eliminates the difference in BP in hypertensive individuals. However, the public health consequences of the small rise in BP are potentially much greater in the normotensive community and the quest must continue to make smoking a historical quirk without contemporary relevance.",

      "title": "Effects of acute and chronic nicotine administration on probability discounting",
      "abstract": "Nicotine use is a continuing public health concern. Smokers are more likely to make risky or maladaptive decisions compared to nonsmokers, so the relation between nicotine and risky choice warrants further investigation. Risky choice can be operationally defined as the choice for a larger, uncertain reinforcer over a smaller, certain reinforcer and can be assessed through a probability-discounting procedure. Acute nicotine administration has been shown to alter risky choice, but because the everyday smoker uses nicotine repeatedly, more research on chronic administration is needed and would allow for assessment of tolerance or sensitization of any effects. The present study examined effects of acute and repeated nicotine administration on probability discounting. Sprague–Dawley rats were used as subjects and the probability-discounting task involved discrete-trial choices between a small, certain reinforcer and a larger, uncertain reinforcer. The probability of larger-reinforcer delivery decreased across blocks within each session. Acute nicotine (0.1–1.0 mg/kg) administration dose-dependently increased risky choice, increased lose-stay ratios (a measure of response perseveration), and decreased reinforcement frequency. Tolerance to nicotine’s effects on larger-reinforcer choice was observed after repeated 1.0 mg/kg nicotine administration. The results of the present study add to the existing literature that acute nicotine administration increases risky choice and demonstrates that tolerance to this effect develops after chronic exposure to the drug. Possible behavioral mechanisms behind this effect are discussed, as are suggestions for future research on nicotine and risky choice.",

      "abstract": "Beverages containing caffeine are consumed by most people in most countries most days. Consumption is mostly in beverages such as coffee, tea and some soft drinks, and smaller amounts from other foods such as chocolate. Children also consume caffeine, though in smaller amounts even relative to their smaller size. Many questions have been asked about possible health effects of caffeine and have been answered by scientific research. Studies on pregnant women consuming caffeine show no effects on the fetus, infants, or on development followed up to school age. There have been many studies on children of school age. For example, it has been shown that a single dose of 3 mg/kg is without appreciable effect on a variety of behavioral and physiological functions, and even 10 mg/kg, had only minimal effects, within the normal range of differences between the children without caffeine. While newborn infants metabolize caffeine slowly, children from less than 1 year to adolescence metabolize caffeine about twice as fast as non-smoking adults. The numerous studies showing safety of caffeine in adults, combined with the direct studies in children showing they are similar and not more susceptible to caffeine than adults, gives assurance that lifelong consumption of caffeine in foods and beverages, starting in childhood, is without deleterious effects on health.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette consumption, excessive amounts of alcohol, poor and unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are just some of the common habits that impair human health in the long run. Tobacco smoke initially damages the respiratory system and then leaves consequences that cause the whole organism to suffer. The basic active pharmacological ingredient of tobacco is nicotine, one of the strongest poisons known to man, which causes addiction and the habit of smoking. Archaeological findings confirm that people drank and produced alcoholic beverages 30,000-40,000 years ago. Young people have a strong desire to become adults and mature as soon as possible and like to behave like adults, then they resort to forms of behavior that are forbidden to them and allowed to adults. The family, school and sports organizations play an important role in health education and learning about harmful habits, in order to protect and improve health. Alcohol consumption among young people can be part of experimentation as part of psychological development during adolescence, but it can also become a habit and lead to addiction and damage to health. It has been found that some people drink, not because they want to drink, but because there have been major personality changes that they cannot stop drinking so they have become addicted to alcohol. Many studies show that children start drinking very early, unaware of the consequences of alcohol. Determination of obesity is performed on the basis of body mass index, which is a criterion for obesity, when it is higher than 30 kg / m2. The European Office of the World Health Organization monitors the movement of overweight in Europe and the data show that Europe has been affected by an epidemic of obesity of similar dimensions as in the United States. On the epidemiological side, obesity has reached pandemic proportions with more than 700 million obese adults worldwide and is a growing public health problem with all the efforts that have been made. A survey on harmful habits among students was conducted for the purpose of writing the Final Thesis. The results of the survey show that 49% of respondents smoke cigarettes, citing: stress, boredom, habit and pleasure. As for alcohol consumption, 66% of respondents admitted that they sometimes enjoy drinking, most often wine or beer. Respondents mostly consume alcoholic beverages for the sake of company, going out and for pleasure. The results of student nutrition are very worrying. Namely, only 25% of the surveyed students said that they eat healthy, while the rest try to eat healthy. In the last question of the survey Which harmful habit did you start consuming the most due to pressure at college? We can see how as many as 60% of respondents started eating unhealthily.",

      "abstract": "What is this ‘physical activity’ thing people keep talking about? Simply put, physical activity is movement of the body (this may be your upper or lower body or both) which expends energy. It is important to remember that physical activity does not just mean exercise! Physical activity is an ‘umbrella term’ which encompasses a range of domains, such as being active in your leisure-time (like taking the dog for a walk or going to a dance class), walking and cycling for transport (this may be going to the local shops or it may be in an effort to beat the peak hour traffic), being active at work (like lifting boxes or laying bricks) and even undertaking active chores at home such as gardening and vacuuming. In Australia, it is recommended that adults accumulate 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity (equivalent to that of a brisk walk) on most, if not all days of the week. If preferred, this activity may be broken up into three 10-minute bouts, which is good news for busy people! This ‘dose’ of physical activity is the minimum amount required for health benefits and has been shown to prevent a number of chronic illnesses that will be discussed in further detail later in this chapter. So why has the government spent up big on mass media campaigns such as ‘Life. Be in it’ (thinking back to the 90s — who remembers the couch potato cartoon character Norm who was the face of that campaign?), and more recently the ‘Swap it, don’t stop it’",

There has been so much focus on these devices that we risk losing our focus on what we know works—a comprehensive strategy to reduce smoking prevalence.3 We must not lose, through neglect, the debate on standardised tobacco packaging or the need to further increase the price of tobacco. We need to move away from fixed positions to some key principles against which we can debate the evidence.\n\nThe first principle must be to ask whether electronic cigarettes are safe. First do no harm. Compared with smoking tobacco it is very clear that electronic cigarettes are much safer.

      "title": "Alcohol and Breastfeeding, a review of the issues",
      "abstract": "Moderate alcohol use by breastfeeding women appears to be relatively common. Alcohol concentrates in breast milk at levels slightly higher than in maternal blood, peaking at 30-60 minutes after consumption. Most studies find no link with the duration of breastfeeding unless drinking is fairly heavy (&gt;2 standard drinks/day). However, seven studies have found that moderate maternal alcohol consumption was associated with a shorter duration of exclusive breastfeeding; one found no difference and one found an increase. Alcohol affects oxytocin release, leading to reductions in breast milk consumption in the following hours. Infant alcohol exposure may increase fussiness and reduce sleep, both temporary if the mother does not continue to drink. These effects on the infant and on the breastfeeding process could be interpreted by mothers as signs of infant dissatisfaction with their breast milk, “insufficient milk,” or other commonly expressed causes for suboptimal breastfeeding patterns. Chronic alcohol consumption, even if moderate, may have a number of more serious effects, including on infant development. In the early weeks or months of life, infant toleration of alcohol is lower than it is at later stages of infancy, and the early breastfeeding process is more susceptible to disruption. Therefore, it may be wise to advise mothers to continue their abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy into the first few months of breastfeeding. Little research has been done on how often women time their drinking so as to avoid infant exposure to alcohol. Health workers and others sometimes propagate myths that alcohol, especially alcoholic beer, is beneficial to breastfeeding. Research is needed in different cultures into whether various forms of cautionary messages are likely to discourage moderate drinkers from initiating breastfeeding or to shorten its duration, and which type of messages if any actually lead to a reduction in drinking during breastfeeding.",

      "abstract": "The most effective way to reduce the health hazards associated with smoking is to prevent children from taking up the habit and to develop better programs to help smokers quit; however given the large number of smokers it is also necessary to determine the relationship between specific tobacco smoke components and the development of various diseases so that manufacturers can develop less harmful cigarettes. In reference to smoking prevention among children educational programs necessitating the active participation of students are more effective than passive programs. In passive programs the student is simply lectured on the effects of smoking but in active programs they are required to record over a period of time their health habits in conjunction with the results of cholesterol blood pressure and physical fitness tests. Smoking cessation clinics offering long term assistance to their clients have higher success rates for one year than clinics providing only short term help. Efforts to clarify the relationship between specific tobacco components and the development of diseases need to be intensified. In reference to cancer a number of animal carcinogens have been found in tobacco smoke. Although a causal relationship between these substances and the development of specific cancers in man has not been proved it is advisable to reduce the amount of these substances in cigarettes. In regard to cardiovascular disease nicotine has been shown to indirectly affect ventricular fibrillation but the role of carbon monoxide in the development of arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease is still in dispute. The relationship between specific components and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has not been determined. The use of filtered cigarettes has reduced the risk of larynx and lung cancer but its role in the development of other diseases has not yet been determined. Graphs include 1) % of teenage smokers by year and by sex; 2) test results comparing smoking habits of an experimental group in an active smoking program with a control group; 3) % distribution of nonsmokers ex-smokers and smokers by sex and education; 4) cigarette sales information for low tar types; and 5) % distribution of lung and larynx cancer cases for filtered and nonfiltered cigarette smokers by sex and amount smoked. Summary tables listing tumor initiating agents carcinogenic agents and organ specific carcinogens in tobacco smoke are provided.",

Hal ini akan sangat berpengaruh terhadap kehidupan bangsa dan negara pada masa mendatang. Perilaku sebagian remaja yang secara nyata telah jauh mengabaikan nilai-nilai kaidah dan norma serta hukum yang berlaku di tengah kehidupan masyarakat menjadi salah satu penyebab maraknya penggunaan narkoba di kalangan generasi muda.

It is not appropriate to suggest that alcohol use should be eliminated but it is important that we take steps to minimise harm produced by intake of inappropriate amounts of this drug. Many alcohol related problems are irreversible once established and thus it is imperative that information be made available to the public and to health care workers to help minimise problems before they become permanently established. It is suggested that harm may be minimised by a number of strategies that include measures to: 1. Prevent the desire or need to drink excessively. 2. Prevent the ingestion of excessive amounts of alcohol. 3. Prevent the effects of excessive intake by protecting susceptible tissues. 4. Treating tissue damage early to prevent progressive injury. Early detection and intervention must play an increasing role in any attempt to minimise alcohol related problems.",

      "abstract": "Ties between the United States military and the tobacco industry trace back to the early parts of the 20th century. During the second world war, for example, cigarette advertisements praising service members were widespread on popular radio programmes and in periodicals.1 Some ads even featured cigarette-using doctors vouching for the great taste and mildness of particular brands. Cigarettes were also included as part of the K-rations and C-rations provided to soldiers and sailors during the second world war, and these cigarettes frequently became more valuable for trading or selling than the food items in the rations.\n\nDuring times of war and peace, many young people (predominantly men, as they have traditionally comprised the bulk of military personnel) started smoking after they joined the military. In fact, it has been widely acknowledged in military circles that many young soldiers and sailors first started smoking during their initial military “boot camp” training. Before 1987, when tobacco use was banned at most training commands across the military services, giving or denying “smoke breaks” was a common form of reward and punishment used by drill instructors and company commanders training new soldiers or sailors.2 If recruits did not already smoke when they entered the military, in boot camp they quickly learned that smoking to get a work break was a desirable thing to do. Even beyond recruit training, the military culture—at least until relatively recently—has traditionally fostered the stereotype of heavy-smoking, hard-drinking, and adventuresome service members.\n\nThis image has had empirical support from several studies indicating that military rates of tobacco and alcohol use have been higher than those found in comparable civilian sectors.3-7 As of 1995, however, the military/civilian differences in tobacco use have narrowed.8 Considering all the services combined, the differences between the military and standardised civilian samples …",

Whereas craving for opioids frequently has been conceptualized as the negative reinforcer of protracted withdrawal or “drug hunger,” craving for cocaine has been conceptualized as the positive reinforcer of remembered euphoria. Medications can reduce both sustained cocaine craving and acute craving induced by a single dose of cocaine, and reductions in both types of craving are correlated with reductions in cocaine use. Furthermore, high levels of craving during treatment or during cue‐induced challenges predict poor treatment response and later relapse to cocaine abuse in those who have attained abstinence.",

      "title": "Alcohol consumption among adolescents in the City of Zagreb and the presence of alcohol drinking among their parents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdolescence is a period in which majority of youth first come into contact with psychoactive substances. For some, this contact is ephemeral and without major consequences, while for others it can be fatal and lead to a complete change of lifestyle and development of addiction. Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that most adolescents consume. This is, besides its legality and availability, due to its eternal presence and incorporation into lifestyle and customs. Adolescents are not attracted by alcohol only because of the identification with the lifestyle of adults, but also as a means to temporarily take away the anxiety associated with feelings of being lost and confused in their current life phase. Alcohol consumption in adolescence is usually characterized with daily need for drinking, and often, intensive drinking on weekends. Experimenting with addictive substances among youth is usually motivated with curiosity, a desire for self-affirmation, imitation and self-assertion. As with adults, alcohol consumption among young people can stimulate and/or be accompanied by a number of other psychiatric disorders.1 With adolescents prone to alcohol use and general psychoactive substances, we can frequently observe behavior disorders, origins of antisocial and borderline personality disorder and mood disorders. These disorders may induce the use of psychoactive substances and lead to a behavioral model characterized by impulsivity, self destructive tendencies and disregard for the consequences of their actions.2-5Previous studies have suggested a number of factors that influence the use of psychoactive substances, such as the structure of adolescent personality, family dynamics, genetics and neurochemical and social factors. Due to the complex interaction of these factors it is difficult to determine the hierarchy of their importance in the development and preferences to alcohol consumption.6-9 Considering the important, if not the most important role that family has in the formation of identity in adolescence10 it is to be expected that the family functioning would be associated with general psychic adjustment of adolescents, their perception of self-esteem, a sense of competence, school achievement and behavioral disorders - delinquent behavior and use of addictive substances.11-13Early psychoanalytic theories made reference to oral regression and the similarity of the phenomenon of addiction with the earliest stage of libidinal development, when the child demands gratification of its desires without any ability to give. Addictive behavior is understood as a narcissistic phenomenon of obsession with achieving personal satisfaction. Recent theories describe dysfunction of the ego, the inability of processing painful and unpleasant feelings related to early object relations, while the cognitive approach attempts to identify negative models of thought related with the experience of adolescent identity confusion, lifestyle, projections of their future, relationship with their parents and peers, with the inability to develop different cognitive schemes. Some studies have shown that, among adolescents who are prone to consuming psychoactive substances the traits of pessimism, impulsiveness, auto-aggression and low self-esteem are more accentuated.2'4SUBJECTS AND METHODSThis study was conducted on 701 high school students in Zagreb during the school year 2011/2012. Selection included 13 general secondary school classes and 18 vocational high school classes. In each school, students engaged in the study came from 1st to 4th grade or, for vocational schools, 1st to 3rd grade. After attaining a written permission of the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, the directors of schools in which the study was conducted were informed on the implementation of research and parents of students in selected classes were sent a notification in which the objectives, methods and modus of research were briefly explained. …",

      "title": "Growing Trend Of Drug Abuse And Misuse And Its Impact On Society A Case Study Of Hyderabad City",
      "abstract": "Drug abuse is the consumption of drug apart from medical need or use, in unnecessary or in excessive quantities.Drug misuse is the use of drugs for the purpose or conditions for which they are not suitable choice or even if they are suitable choice but used in improper dosage.The menace of drug misuse and abuse is increasing globally day by day and Hyderabad being one of the largest cities of Pakistan is experiencing this practice widely.Psychoactive drugs, sedatives, hypnotics, antibiotics, multivitamins, laxatives, heavy tonics, steroids, antacids, cough syrups and analgesics etc, are commonly misused and abused in our society.Among these psychoactive agents and antibiotics are the most frequently misused and abused drugs.Psychoactive agents have great potential for physiological and psychological addiction hence the users continuously use them to cope the situation of anxiety, insomnia, depression and pain. It has been observed that repeated use of such agents creates tolerance, which leads to frequent increase in dose of the drug.On other hand, misuse of antibiotics leads to microbial resistance ultimately leading to decreased efficiency of the drug in particular family or community.Self medication and over medication have become the norm.Self medication is risky and highly unsafe and at times dangerous too, it leads to misuse and abuse as well.Non-medically qualified people (Quacks / Store keepers) are not able to judge the correct use of medication or determine the dose, nor are they aware of the risks involved in drug misuse and abuse.It is because all the drugs which are available in market have great potential to be misused and abused.\r\nThe initially oobserved causes of drug abuse and misuse are lack of patient’s awareness regarding side effects or complications of drugs, improper patients’ counseling, prescriber’s lust for heavy OPD (because of which incomplete message regarding proper usage of drug is transferred to patients), wrong prescription (generated by unqualified people), prescriptions error, drug advertisement, busy pharmacies, easy availability of controlled drugs, dispensing error, pharmacies or medical stores being run without professional person (without registered Pharmacist), Improper follow-up of patients, lack of concentration of drug regulating agencies and unethical promotions of pharmaceutical companies etc.Lack of patient counseling has a significant role in drug misuse and may result in drug abuse or addiction.Prescription error is one the most important factor that leads to drug misuse and abuse.A prescribing error occurs as a result of a prescribing decision or during prescription writing process.Prescription writing skills / instructions should be according to the WHO guidelines which suggest giving the medicine to the patients in the proper manner by Pharmacist / dispenser / storing keeper.Many countries have adopted WHO guideline for the prescription in their health care system.The Pharmacist is the person professionally equipped with knowledge to understand all the drawbacks /complications of drug abuse and misuse and its harmful impacts on health of people.The objectives of this study are to explore the causes of drug misuse, abuse and their contributing factors in Hyderabad city.The survey study was conducted in different main targeted areas of Hyderabad city A questionnaire and analysis sheets were designed with the study objectives. W.H.O parameters (World Health Organization Guidelines / Standards) for prescriptions writings,Drug information hand book (Lexi-comp) and BNF (British National formulary) were used for evaluation of proper dose of dosage form and drug-drug interaction. Ms-Office 2007 and Statistical tools such as Mean, Standard Deviation, Cumulative Frequencies,Relative Frequencies, Chi square test, Z test, ANOVA, Regression Analysis, and Graphical Representation of data have been applied through the Statistical package SPSS17.0.Trend of sales at medical stores in Hyderabad city shows that sale with prescription is 41.6% and without prescription is 58.4%.It reflects easy availability ofvdrugs on large scale without prescription whereas on other side 49.4% of patients/customers were even not asked about availability of doctors’ prescription by medical store keeper.\r\nAmong the interviewed customers/patients male (62.4%) and female (37.6%) responded positively. It was observed that 29.1% patients/customers were between 31–45years ages. Maximum patients/customers without prescription (13.7%) were found in Pretabad, Hyderabad, on other hand maximum patients/customers with prescription (8.6%) were found in Saddar, Hyderabad, respectively.The available prescriptions (41.6%) were evaluated and categorized in four types.As Specialist prescriptions (56.4%), General practitioner prescriptions (19.8%),Hospital /Medical center prescriptions (15.7%) and prescriptions without name and address of doctor (8.1%); this includes non qualified persons/quacks as well. As the prescription error factor in drug misuse was considered the error was 30.6% in all prescriptions categories, whereas maximum errors were found in the prescriptions, which were without name and address of prescribers.Collectively 8.3% prescriptions were found very old and 11.8% were without date of generation of prescription.Trend of self medication is another factor of drug misuse identified on large scale in Hyderabad.According to data collected from patients/customers without prescription (58.4%), the decision of self medication, 55.8%, is influenced /suggested by self judgment, chemist, drug advertisement, friends, relatives,neighbors etc.and about 44.2% patients/customers were influenced by doctor.Majority of these customers/patients, 43.6%, were not clear regarding dose, frequency and duration of therapy.In 7.4% cases medicines were sold to 46 years age customers are involved mostly in drug misuse and abuse.Furthermore, 500 Patients/Respondents were interviewed in Out Patient’s Department (OPD) of a government hospital in Hyderabad to analyze the contribution of improper patient counseling factor in drug misuse and abuse.Out of 500 patients,\\159 (31.8%) were not counseled by any health professional, whereas 341 (68.2%) were counseled by the prescriber, store keeper/dispenser or both.Out of 159 uncounseled patients, the highest number of patients 76 (47.7%) were unaware regarding duration of therapy.On the other hand, among 341(68%) counseled patients, 218 (63.92%) were counseled by both prescriber and storekeeper/dispenser, 65(19.06%) by prescriber only and 58(17.0%) by store keeper / dispenser only.The underlying reasons for improper counseling may be lack of pharmacist in hospital settings, heavy OPDs and busy pharmacies. Since the calculated value Z = 9.7061 falls in the critical region, so we reject the null hypothesis, it shows P1 ≠ P2, at 0.05 level of significance and concludes on the basis of data, that the proportion of both gender (male and female) are different with respect to the drug misuse and abuse.\r\nAdditionally a total of 286 antibiotic containing prescriptions were randomly sampled from a government hospital.These prescriptions were categorized according to the antibiotic classes and errors were identified according to various standards W.H.O (World Health Organization) guidelines/standards for prescription writing.The extent of errors were calculated and the highest proportion of the prescriptions (89.86%, n=257) failed to demonstrate the patient’s weight and the least number of prescriptions (2.44%, n=07) contained the dosage form errors.The mean error per prescription was observed as 6.35 with S.D 3.138 and 95% confidence interval for μ is (5.98, 6.71).The major reasons were heavy patients’ influx, insufficient knowledge regarding prescription writing guidelines to prescribers and the lack of pharmacists. Continuous educational training programs regarding prescription writing skills, introduction of computerized prescription order entry system and by recognizing and appreciating the role of pharmacist in evaluating the prescriptions can substantially reduce these widespread errors.On other side 150 related peoples of health care systems (Doctors, Retailers/Store keepers and Pharmaceutical marketing personals) were interviewed to assess the role of these peoples in the eradications of drug abuse and misuse in our society.It was largely observed that there is lack of concentration, especially doctors and store keepers/retailers in the process of counseling with patients/customers regarding harmful effects of drug abuse and misuse on the health of patients/customers.Our results also found that majority of medical stores / pharmacies have no any criteria for dispensing the all types of medicines, which is contributing to easy availability of drugs and lack of concentration of drug regulating agencies at pharmacies/medical stores.This study will recommend the proposals for eradication of this social evil, which has been affecting the health of considerable portion of population in Hyderabad.The findings of this study will help Government to realize the importance of pharmacist in health care system and formulate the long-lasting strategy/policy to deal with problem of drug abuse and misuse and their contributing factors.",

      "abstract": "The use of alcohol is often intimately associated with sport. As well as providing a source of energy, alcohol (ethanol) has metabolic, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, and neuromuscular actions that may affect exercise performance. Strength is minimally affected, and performance impairments depend on the dose of alcohol and subject habituation to alcohol intake, exercise duration, environmental conditions, and other factors. Central nervous system function is impaired at high doses, resulting in decrements in cognitive function and motor skill, as well as behavioral changes that may have adverse effects on performance. Effects may persist for hours after intoxication.",

This opinion is part of a larger speculative web, namely, that tobacco use is genetically predetermined and that the people destined to use tobacco are the very people who are prone to have smaller babies and who are most likely to develop the sundry ills more commonly regarded as being caused by tobacco use. 1-3 Hickey's hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for the observation that people who use tobacco often feel more normal while smoking than immediately after stopping. The conventional interpretation of this phenomenon is that nicotine is a psychoactive drug that induces tolerance, and the abrupt cessation of tobacco use often precipitates a withdrawal syndrome. 4,5 As in alcohol or narcotic withdrawal, the newly abstinent person may feel ill and experience a temporary decrement in performance.

      "abstract": "En las ultimas decadas ha adquirido especial relevancia, entre los jovenes y adolescentes, el patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol, el cual presenta alta prevalencia en la mayoria de los paises occidentales. En la literatura anglosajona se denomina binge drinking (BD) y se caracteriza por la ingesta de grandes cantidades de alcohol en un corto periodo de tiempo, normalmente el fin de semana, que suele llevar a la embriaguez, y alternando periodos de abstinencia entre los episodios de consumo intensivo. El consumo intensivo de alcohol (CIA) parece resultar significativamente mas danino para el cerebro que su consumo regular, y mayores aun son las implicaciones al tratarse de poblacion juvenil. El cortex prefrontal, soporte neuronal de los procesos ejecutivos y de los rasgos de personalidad, parece resultar especialmente afectado por el consumo de alcohol. Aspectos como la desinhibicion o la impulsividad, plausiblemente mediado por la actividad neuronal en los circuitos prefrontales se han considerado como una consecuencia habitual del consumo de alcohol; sin embargo esta misma impulsividad puede representar un indicador de vulnerabilidad para la adiccion al alcohol y otras sustancias. El objetivo general de este estudio es determinar las relaciones existentes entre el consumo intensivo de alcohol en jovenes y su actividad prefrontal, estimada a partir de su rendimiento neuropsicologico y su perfil de personalidad. Los resultados obtenidos nos permiten establecer las siguientes conclusiones: Existen diferencias en el perfil de personalidad entre los jovenes CIA y No CIA. El perfil de personalidad de los sujetos CIA permite explicar aspectos relacionados con el consumo de alcohol. De este perfil, el factor desinhibicion es el que mejor explica estas conductas. El mayor consumo de alcohol se asocia con mas errores atencionales y disminucion de la velocidad de procesamiento, pero no con menor rendimiento en memoria de trabajo u otras funciones ejecutivas. Existe asociacion entre el perfil de personalidad CIA y el rendimiento neuropsicologico. El perfil de personalidad predice en mayor grado que el rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas el consumo de alcohol al cabo de dos anos. El mantenimiento del patron CIA implica la persistencia de diferencias de rendimiento en tareas de control atencional y velocidad de procesamiento, sensibles al funcionamiento prefrontal.",

      "abstract": "A.Latar PendahuluanPada kehidupan remaja saat ini, merokok merupakan suatu pemandangan yang sangat tidak asing. Kebiasaan merokok dianggap dapat memberikan kenikmatan bagi perokok, namun di lain pihak dapat menimbulkan dampak buruk bagi perokok sendiri maupun orang-orang disekitarnya. Berbagai kandungan zat yang terdapat di dalam rokok memberikan dampak negatif pada tubuh penghisapnya. Sekarang ini kegiatan merokok juga banyak dilakukan oleh remaja yang biasanya dilakukan di depan orang lain, terutama dilakukan di depan kelompoknya karena mereka sangat tertatik kepada kelompok sebayanya atau dengan kata lain terikat dengan kelompoknya. Hal ini sebenarnya telah diketahui oleh remaja khususnya dan umumnya masyarakat dunia, bahwa merokok itu mengganggu kesehatan. Masalah rokok pada hakekatnya sudah menjadi masalah nasional,bahkan internasional. Pemerintah tentunya juga tidak tinggal diam atas fenomena banyaknya kebiasaan merokok pada kalangan masyarakat,khususnya kalangan remaja yang masih berstatus pelajar. Selain kebijakan-kebijakan pemerintah akan larangan merokok diberbagai tempat umum seperti rumah sakit, di kantor-kantor, lingkungan sekolahan, serta tempat umum lainnya tentunya pemerintah juga mengeluarkan peraturan yang sah seperti 3HUDWXUDQ 3HPHULQWDK 5, 1RPRU 7DKXQ WHQWDQJ ³3HQJDPDQDQ 5RNRN %DJL.HVHKDWDQ¥\\DQJGLNeluarkan resmi oleh Presiden. Masalah perilaku mengkonsumsi rokok tidak hanya terjadi pada kalangan remaja ataupun kalangan pelajar pada masyarakat kota metropolis saja, akan tetapi sehubungan dengan berbagai pengaruh dan perilaku remaja karena pergaulan, maka pemuda atau remaja bahkan pelajar di pedesaan saja juga telah banyak yang melakukan kegiatan merokok. Termasuk dalam hal ini para pelajar SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Dari kondisi itulah maka dalam penelitian ini akan mengangkat topik dan masalah penelitian tentang perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Penulis merasa tertarik untuk melaksanakan penelitian ini karena kehidupan remaja khususnya para pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar sebagian besar merokok. Bahkan tidak hanya dilingkungan Sekolahan tempat penelitian saja tetapi secara umum merebak keseluruh penjuru pelosok desa di sekitar tempat penelitian. Adapun rumusan masalah yang menjadi dasar penilitian mengenai perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar,yaitu; (1)Apa yang mendorong seorang pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar, memiliki perilaku merokok?(2)Apa dampak yang ditimbulkan",

These electronic nicotine-delivery systems come in a wide variety due to differences in nicotine concentrations, e-liquid volumes, carrier compounds, additives, flavours, and battery voltages. Each EC device typically operates using a standard system, which includes a rechargeable lithium battery, a vaporisation chamber, and a cartridge. The lithium battery powers the vaporisation chamber, which contains the atomiser. Users inhale through a mouthpiece, and the airflow activates a sensor, initiating the atomiser to deliver nicotine to the lungs. The liquid nicotine stored in a small cartridge is then vaporised and inhaled.",

Some are willing to use it occasionally, to enjoy it socially with friends; but it is not important to them and they can happily do without it. Some become regular users and integrate the drug into their lives, but nevertheless are able to give it up without much trouble if they decide to. Finally, there are those who use a drug frequently and regularly and find themselves unable to quit, or at least can quit only with the greatest difficulty, and even then are likely to relapse. This last group—the addicts—represents the greatest problem for society and the greatest challenge for medical science.",

Thus it was not easy to refrain. Moreover , these offenders had a low standard of living, and a low level of education. Therefore, they had an urge to try drugs as an escape. After their first use of drugs they felt relaxed by the effects of the drugs. As a result, they become happy, relaxed, and they could work better. This made the drug users want to continue the use. Also, these drug users had a belief that heroin was the most dangerous kind of drug. Thery believed that other kinds of drugs were safer than heroin, and therefore not dangerous . Moreover, those who lived near the offenders did not pay particular attention to drug addiction problems. These factors contributed to the tendency to use drugs continuously. Finally , they became addicted to drugs. It was found that each drug user had tried more than on kind of drug. They usually began with the mildest and changed to the more dangerous ones, At the end almost all became drug dealers themselves.In the Northeast of Thailand the selling And buying of drugs was done in habitation region both in and out of town.",

Die Lebensumstände dieser Menschen sowie ihr Drogenkonsum wirken sich insgesamt genommen eher negativ auf ihre Gesundheit aus. Das soll anhand empirischer Daten genauer dargestellt werden. Perspektivisch geht es bei den älteren Abhängigen von Strassendrogen allerdings weniger um verbotene psychoaktive Substanzen, sondern erheblich häufiger um legale Medikamente zur Behandlung von Abhängigkeit (Substitutionsbehandlungen usw.) und von anderen Medikamenten, die zur Behandlung von weiteren gesundheitlichen Beschwerden eingesetzt werden. Die Betroffenen selbst konsumieren darüber hinaus weitere legale Drogen, was sich ebenfalls negativ auch ihren Gesundheitszustand auswirken kann.

In North America there is a tendency to regard physical dependence, as revealed by a withdrawal reaction, as the cardinal feature of addiction, but this is putting the cart before the horse. The essence of addiction is drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior that has become a central element of the individual's life pattern. If the frequency and amount of drug taking are sufficiently high, and the circumstances of use are appropriate, tolerance and physical dependence are likely to result, and social, psychiatric and medical problems of various kinds may be produced, but these are all consequences of addiction.

      "abstract": "Addiction (or drug dependence, as the World Health Organization now recommends that it be called) is a concept that was originally clear in empirical terms, but became progressively more confused by successive attempts at official definitions. In North America there is a tendency to regard physical dependence, as revealed by a withdrawal reaction, as the cardinal feature of addiction, but this is putting the cart before the horse. The essence of addiction is drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior that has become a central element of the individual's life pattern. If the frequency and amount of drug taking are sufficiently high, and the circumstances of use are appropriate, tolerance and physical dependence are likely to result, and social, psychiatric and medical problems of various kinds may be produced, but these are all consequences of addiction. The fundamental question is: What causes the drug-taking behavior to become so strongly established as to generate these consequences?",

Delirium tremens is a potentially fatal symptom complex which may develop when a prolonged daily drinking pattern is interrupted by illness or injury. It was first described by Thomas Sutton in 1813. The withdrawal period is usually less than 72 hours but may be as long as ten days. It is not necessary to maintain a measurable blood level of alcohol for this therapy to be effective. Ten to 15 milliliters of ethanol given hourly, either orally or intravenously, is usually sufficient to prevent or control serious withdrawal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Consumption of drugs by human beings has had a long history, extending millennia before the first written accounts of wine consumption or the smoking of opium. Because drugs take so many different forms and are consumed in so many different ways, the most inclusive definition of “drug” is desirable. Alcohol is certainly a component of human drug repertoires, and archaeological evidence indicates that it is one of the most ancient of plant‐derived drugs. Human trends in drug consumption have moved in the direction of increasing purity and potency of plant‐derived preparations, for example, distilled spirits that evolved from fermented brews of grape juice, malt water, or corn mash. Concepts of drug abuse and drug dependence emerged as potent preparations gained popularity and established perceptions of chronic intoxication. Both of these terms appear aimed at denoting consumers of drugs who are not necessarily addicted to them. “Drug abuse” and “alcohol abuse” have become parts of the names of two national agencies in the United States dedicated to the study of drug‐using patterns. “Drug dependence” denotes a condition similar to addiction but without the additional stigma of vulnerability to withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Current smoking cessation treatments largely address pharmacological dependence on nicotine. New approaches are needed that address both nicotine dependence and psychological dependence on cigarettes as the source of nicotine. One such approach is the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content. We reviewed the available literature on the use of reduced–nicotine content cigarettes as a cessation aid. One case series study and trial data indicate that reduction in the level of nicotine in cigarette tobacco can reduce the level of nicotine dependence in smokers and do so without adverse effects on cardiovascular biomarkers or significant compensatory smoking. We identified three clinical trials (total n = 489) that suggest that smokers can dissociate nicotine delivery from the act of smoking if they use reduced–nicotine content cigarettes in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. The identified studies point to a benefit but involved only a small number of participants and provide only limited data on long-term abstinence. More definitive evidence from larger trials with longer follow-up is needed to clarify the role of reduced nicotine cigarettes as an aid to smoking cessation.",

CONCLUSION.Tobacco smoking serves as a mild stimulant followed by a slight degree of narcosis, the supersensitive become calm and lose their irritability, and the dull anid apathetic are stimulated.The physiological evidence clearly points to this effect, but the explanation has yet to be learned.Smoking, however, leads to digestive and circulatory dis- turbainces.There is an increasing impressioni amongst clinicians that the insidious action of niicotine spread over many years of continuous absorption is responsible for at least some of the cardio-vascular diseases so common in middle and later life.It may be argued that if nicotine adds to the agreeable- liess of life, why not use a path so pleasanit?In persons of vivid sensations, to calm the commotion of conflicting sensations may be beneficial, even to the higher faculties; in the dull and listless to stimulate thought must be bene- ficial.It may well be that living in a civilization sucll as ours, under the conditions of strain imposed by residence in cities, the ordinary man shows in his nervous responses variations from the normal, and on such tobacco exerts a beneficial function.To what extent strict moderation in the use of tobacco leads to vascular degeneration is un- eertain; is it the rule or the exceptionP?This is the vital question to which we require an answer, and upon this answer something of the well-being of the nation depends.In conclusion I venture to suggest that the collective sagacity of this society, and that of the.medical profession as a whole, could occupy itself witlh no subject more important to the nation than that of tobacco smoking.REHERENCES.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity and a particularly common and intractable addictive disorder. Research shows that nicotine is a sine qua non of tobacco addiction and that it produces the hallmark effects of addictive drugs: sensitization, tolerance, physical dependence, and euphoria/elation. Research on the development of smoking reveals that although smoking prevalence has declined from a peak in the mid-1990s, close to 30% of twelfth graders still smoke. Smoking in adolescents is related to development of physical dependence, ethnicity, impulsivity, affective disorder, and peer influences. However, which of these exerts the greatest causal effects is unknown, and their influence no doubt varies across individuals and across development. Once dependence on tobacco smoking is established, evidence suggests that tobacco motivation is strongly influenced by a reduction in withdrawal symptoms, an expectation of stress reduction, and conditioned reinforcement. Nicotine motivation may also be influenced by modulation in stimulus incentive value.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The association between cigarette use and Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been well known in the literature since more than 50 years ago. Large population studies showed that smokers developed PD less often than non-smokers and that the duration of smoking was inversely proportional to PD risk. There are two primary hypotheses for this association in the literature. First, long-standing hypothesis, is that smoking cigarettes is neuroprotective. The second, recent hypothesis, is that there exists biological predisposition to PD, which also manifests in decreased stimulus seeking behavior, hence lesser likelihood to smoke or use nicotine (reverse causation). The objective of this article is to summarize the evidence available in the literature and evaluate the causality of the association between Parkinson’s disease and smoking cigarettes or nicotine ingestion. It is found that the first, directly causal hypothesis is a stronger contributor to the effect, although the reversely causal mechanism could play a role. It is found that smokeless tobacco use decreases the risk of PD stronger than smoking cigarettes does, suggesting that nicotine is more important in neuroprotection than other cigarette smoke constituents.",

Una delle maggiori sfide del fumatore in remissione e quello di riuscire a gestire il desiderio impulsivo di ricominciare a fumare che compare specie nelle situazioni ad alto rischio. L’obiettivo della ricerca e stato quello di comprendere quali sono le situazioni ambientali di forte richiamo al fumo nei primi cinque giorni dopo l’interruzione ed esplorare le strategie di adattamento alla situazione astinenziale, in particolare le modalita di coping messe in atto dai soggetti durante la comparsa delle tentazioni. I risultati indicano che i momenti e i contesti della giornata di maggiore tentazione sono la mattina e la situazione post-prandiale, la prima connessa con meccanismi fisiologici, la seconda di ordine psicosociale. Per quanto riguarda le strategie di coping, e stata creata una tavola tassonomica in cui si distinguono tre macro-categorie: agire, pensare e aspettare che passi. Le strategie comportamentali, piu frequenti, allontanano il soggetto dalla situazione ad alto rischio rendendo piu difficile il richiamo della sigaretta; le strategie cognitive mirano ad aumentare il livello di fiducia in se stessi e di autoefficacia del soggetto, alimentando la convinzione di diventare un ex-fumatore; infine nel terzo caso, i soggetti resistono all’impulso aspettando che questo autonomamente si affievolisca, mantenendo lo stato comportamentale precedente alla sua comparsa.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco addiction is one of the oldest known addictions with annual death toll of three million. And India is the second largest consumer of tobacco in the world because of easy availability of variety of smoking and smokeless tobacco products in the market. This has made the situating very complex in India, as the same tobacco generating billions of revenues for India is also a financial burden over the health care sector. Tobacco is a risk factor for approximately 50 serious health care diseases including infertility. But it is surprising that only 22% of the general population are familiar with the reproductive risks associated with smoking. This shear ignorance has led to increase in smoking among women too. Tobacco use not only decrease fecundity and reproductive potential of the individual, but also causes relationship disharmony among the already emotional wrecked infertile couple. Though this stress might be the contributory factor towards tobacco abuse but ironically this tobacco use further escalates the financial ‘stress’ in these couples. Multiple attempts may be required during the process of quitting and the likelihood of success increases with each attempt. The ultimate key is counselling, education, and encouragement at each clinical visit.",

Psychoactive substances have also a negative impact on pregnancy, the fetus, and the neonate. Tobacco addiction may accompany other dependencies and be one of useful markers of them. Smoking cigarettes in the substance dependent pregnant women also substantially increases the risk of both maternal and fetal complications.

      "title": "The Negative Impact of Food Neophobia on the People of Chandigarh Tri-City, India",
      "abstract": "Food neophobia (FN) is the person’s fear to try eating new or unfamiliar foods. Food neophobia is directly attached with low quality of diet in adults; thus, the understanding of the relationship between FN and food consumption in more depth appears to be a key issue [1]. There are various factors that influence this eating behaviour of a person such as fear, taste, unwillingness, bad experience and lack of knowledge etc. The level of food neophobia generally decreases with late childhood to adult and increases with adult to old age.\r\nThrough the demographical influences or the inherited properties of the individual food neophobia can be displaced.  At some point of time in our life we all have said no to some particular food item because of our liking or disliking. Sometimes we do not eat some food due to the fear of trying a new food. A bad experience with a particular food may become the reason with some people not trying new food; similarly, lack of knowledge about different foods has been a factor that many people avoid trying a new food. There may be many other reasons for people to avoid or not trying new food. These eating behaviours of people leave them from getting proper nutrition that they need. Because they have restricted them to limited types of food, they may not be eating enough vitamins or nutrients. It’s been observed that neophobia can not only lead to malnutrition, but it also refrain the individual from social abilities. Food neophobia also restricts the individual from taking the healthier alternative of the food and also restricts in trying the new or traditional food items [2] [3].\r\nThe aim of the study was to access the relationship between food neophobia with demographic factors, and education in adults living in urban versus rural areas. This research has been conducted in the Tri-city, Punjab India. Primary data was collected from urban, suburban and rural areas through Google forms, print questionnaires and personal interviews. The questionnaire used in the study indicates the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS), the gender based choices, questions regarding food choice based on demographic factors like gender, age and income, questions on eating behavior and the different eating habits in relation to urban and rural. Data were collected via questionnaire. Total 600 people of age groups (30-45 years & 46 – 60 years) among diversified population of tri-city, Chandigarh, Panchkula & Mohali were given the questionnaires to fill-up.  441 useful responses were received which includes 246 responses from females and 195 responses from males.\r\nThe questionnaire was designed in such manner that it captures data regarding age and gender under demography, and education among people residing in rural as well as urban areas of the tri-city.\r\nThis research will give a insight about the malnutrition due to food neophobia specially in females, we found that geographical location plays an important role and the type of food preferred by urban and rural and the outcomes due to eating habits. This study will give an insight about the eating habits in relation to income and expenditure. We found that food neophobia strongly influence the variables selected for the study. Overall, the results suggest that food neophobia is an important barrier to dietary change and addressing diet-related health problems.  Actions focusing on alternate food choices may help to reduce the neophobia in adults thus increase the chances of maintaining the nutritious diet. Certain theoretical and practical implications in relation to food consumption and food neophobia are offered. Further research is recommended to confirm the observed relationships under different socio-cultural conditions.",

Participants used palm-top computers to record their first lapse, and their reaction to it, within minutes of the event, and were followed for 3 months to assess subsequent smoking. Indicators of the Abstinence Violation Effect--self-efficacy, attributions, and affective reactions to the lapse--generally failed to predict progression to relapse, but participants who felt like giving up after the first lapse progressed more rapidly to a second lapse. Participants who attempted restorative coping were less likely to progress to another lapse on the same day. Those whose lapses were triggered by stress progressed more quickly, whereas those triggered by eating and drinking or accompanied by alcohol consumption progressed more slowly. More nicotine-dependent participants progressed more rapidly toward relapse, but neither the amount smoked in the first lapse nor its subjective reinforcement predicted progression.",

Este ultimo e citado frequentemente como o principal motivo para a relutância em parar de fumar e recaida depois da cessacao,especialmente nos fumadores que apresentam preocupacoes com o seu peso. Contudo, e hoje consensual que os beneficios da cessacao do consumo de tabaco superam eventuais riscos que esta possa apresentar.De forma a promover um consumo alimentar adequado durante a cessacao tabagica, fazem-se diversas recomendacoes, baseadas na evidencia cientifica mais recente, facilitando a adesao terapeutica e a continuacao do processo e reduzindo o risco do aumento de peso corporal.",

      "title": "Tobacco and smoking cessation",
      "abstract": "Background: Tobacco products have been used by human for a long history. The prevalence of tobacco use varies in different countries. Tobacco use is different from tobacco use disorder. Tobacco use disorder is a problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to significant distress or impairment. Cigarette smoking is a chronic relapsing substance use disorder caused by addiction to nicotine. Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 different chemical compounds, of which 93 of them are harmful substances. Methods: In this review, the authors intended to address the issues of harmful effects of cigarette smoking and how to cease smoking. Results: Abundant studies showed that tobacco use is the main risk factor of morbidity and mortality in the world. People who use tobacco products should be advised to quit smoking and offered appropriate treatment. It is better for health-care providers to make the smoking cessation treatment as a standard component of medical care. Data from evidence-based literature showed that smoking cessation therapy can significantly raise smoking cessation rates and should be routinely in persons who are willing to quit tobacco smoking. Smoking cessation treatment includes psychosocial interventions and pharmacological treatment, which may be used in combination. Nonpharmacological management may be individual or group sessions, and it may include motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and others. Delivery formats of stop-smoking interventions are varied. Pharmacological therapy includes nicotine replacement treatment and smoking aids such as bupropion and varenicline. Morbidity and mortality rates are decreased with tobacco cessation at any point in time, although cessation before the age of 40 years has the most significant effect. Conclusion: The Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act took effect since 1997 in Taiwan. Rates of Taiwanese tobacco use have been steadily declining. Brilliant achievements in the field of tobacco control in Taiwan draw international attention.",

En utilisant un modèle à effets fixes et des données de panel provenant de la cohorte Gazel, les résultats montrent que le choc de santé a un impact significatif sur ces comportements de santé. Plus précisément, il induit une baisse significative et durable de la consommation de tabac et d’alcool pendant, respectivement, 5 ans et 3 ans, mais n’influence pas l’IMC. Ces résultats sont à mettre en exergue avec ceux des tentatives d’arrêt ou de diminution de la consommation de tabac qui durent, en moyenne, 2,4 mois. Ce qui est 25 fois moins long que la diminution effective suite à un choc de santé. Ainsi, les résultats montrent que subir un choc de santé est un déterminant majeur de la durée de réduction de la consommation de tabac.",

      "abstract": "Weight-loss supplements typically fall into 1 of 4 categories depending on their hypothesized mechanism of action: products that block the absorption of fat or carbohydrate, stimulants that increase thermogenesis, products that change metabolism and improve body composition, and products that suppress appetite or give a sense of fullness. Each category is reviewed, and an overview of the current science related to their effectiveness is presented. While some weight-loss supplements produce modest effects (&lt;2 kg weight loss), many have either no or few randomized clinical trials examining their effectiveness. A number of factors confound research results associated with the efficacy of weight-loss supplements, such as small sample sizes, short intervention periods, little or no follow-up, and whether the supplement is given in combination with an energy-restricted diet or increased exercise expenditure. There is no strong research evidence indicating that a specific supplement will produce significant weight loss (&gt;2 kg), especially in the long term. Some foods or supplements such as green tea, fiber, and calcium supplements or dairy products may complement a healthy lifestyle to produce small weight losses or prevent weight gain over time. Weight-loss supplements containing metabolic stimulants (e.g., caffeine, ephedra, synephrine) are most likely to produce adverse side effects and should be avoided.",

In assessing the causal relationship, I estimate fixed‐effects instrumental variable models by using exogenous variation in adopting a reduced workweek in South Korea as an instrument for work hours. The estimation results reveal that shortening work hours induces individuals to exercise regularly and decreases the likelihood of smoking, with more pronounced effects for heavy smokers. While a work‐hour reduction substantially increases the probability of drinking participation, it does not significantly affect the likelihood of frequent or daily drinking habits. In addition, the effect of a work‐hour reduction on regular exercise is salient among women and older groups, and the effect on smoking behaviors is more pronounced among men and middle‐aged groups.

      "title": "Auswirkungen des Passivrauchens auf die Entwicklung von Kleinkindern",
      "abstract": "Solange Tabakwaren konsumiert werden, existiert auch das Problem des Passivrauchens. Empfanden fruher Nichtraucher den Rauch hauptsachlich als Belastigung, so sind heute auch die gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen ein bedeutender Faktor. Fur die Arbeitswelt gelten bereits Verordnungen, um Arbeitnehmer vor dem unfreiwilligen Mitrauchen zu schutzen.\r\nGrundlage hierfur sind Erkenntnisse uber die Zusammensetzung der Schadstoffe des exhalierten Rauches und des verglimmenden Tabaks (Nebenstromrauch). Im privaten Bereich ist man auf die Rucksichtnahme der Raucher angewiesen.\r\nZiel dieser Arbeit ist es, den Fokus des Passivrauchens auf die Gruppe der Kleinkinder zu richten. Fur die nachste Umgebung der Kinder gibt es keine gesetzlichen Regelungen zum Schutz vor Passivrauchen. Ob dies notwendig ist, soll mit Hilfe folgender Fragestellungen nachgegangen werden: Wie verhalten sich rauchende Eltern gegenuber ihren Kindern zu Hause oder im Auto? Nehmen sie Rucksicht und vermeiden sie den Tabakkonsum in der Wohnung? Wissen sie, dass Passivrauchen ihren Kindern schadet? Sind Ihre Kinder haufiger krank als Kinder in Nichtraucherhaushalten? Oder stellen die Eltern bei ihren Kindern andere Auffalligkeiten fest? Hat Passivrauchen kurz- oder langfristig Auswirkungen\r\nauf ihre kindliche Entwicklung? Die Beantwortung dieser Fragen kann moglicherweise Aufschluss geben, in wie weit der soziale Hintergrund der Eltern (z.B. niedriger Bildungsabschluss) ein Einflussfaktor darstellt, der sich auf die Entwicklung von\r\nKleinkindern auswirken kann. Weiterhin soll aufgezeigt werden, ob es eine gesundheitliche Ungleichheit zwischen Tabakrauch exponierten und nichtexponierten Kindern gibt oder nicht.\r\nAus der Literatur kann man entnehmen, dass gesicherte Daten uber die Auswirkungen des Passivrauchens bei Kleinkindern vorliegen. Kinderarzte und Kinderkliniken warnen aufgrund von Studien vor Gefahren, wenn Kinder dem Tabakrauch exponiert sind. Zur Klarung der Fragen wird wie folgt vorgegangen:\r\nIm theoretischen Teil (II) werden die Hintergrunde des Tabakkonsums und den sich daraus ergebenden Auswirkungen beschrieben. So wird zunachst die Droge Tabak vorgestellt. Es soll ein Eindruck vermittelt werden, warum sie in unserer Gesellschaft einen relativ hohen Stellenwert besitzt. Hierfur werden die kulturhistorischen Zusammenhange, die pharmakologischen Eigenschaften des Nikotins, Definitionen der Abhangigkeit,\r\npsychosoziale Erklarungsmodelle sowie Praventionsansatze aufgezeigt. Daran anschliesend wird auf das Passivrauchen eingegangen, Definitionen aufgefuhrt und Auswirkungen fur mogliche somatische Erkrankungen oder andere Auffalligkeiten dargestellt. Das daran folgende Kapitel geht auf die Entwicklungsvoraussetzungen ein und welche Folgen Storungen auf die weitere Entwicklung haben konnen; teilweise werden Hintergrunde ausfuhrlicher vorgestellt. Der rechtliche Anspruch des Kindes\r\nauf eine ungefahrdete Entwicklung wird hier auch kurz aufgezeigt. Im praktischen Teil wird die empirische Untersuchung vorgestellt, Hypothesen dargelegt. Es folgen die Untersuchungsdurchfuhrung, Ergebnisdarstellung, Interpretation, Hypothesenuberprufung sowie Konsequenzen, z.B. hinsichtlich der Pravention und neue Fragestellungen. Eine personliche Stellungnahme bildet den Abschluss der Arbeit.\r\nAn dieser Stelle soll darauf hingewiesen werden, dass das Verhalten der rauchenden Eltern nicht verteufelt werden soll. Das ist nicht das Anliegen dieser Untersuchung. In Deutschland haben wir eine demokratische Drogen- und Suchtpolitik (vgl. HURRELMANN, 2000, S.:455). Der Gebrauch von psychoaktiven Substanzen liegt in der Entscheidung des\r\nBurgers. Das Rauchen hat in unserer Gesellschaft eine so hohe Akzeptanz und wird auch von staatlicher Seite nur wenig restringiert, so dass man Eltern allein nicht verurteilen oder stigmatisieren sollte. Auch einen personlichen Konflikt sollte man mit dem Raucher vermeiden. Er weis meistens selbst, dass er andere schadigt. Vielmehr sollte man die Konsumenten und in besonderer Weise die Eltern als Partner gewinnen und durch ein Angebot an geeigneten Masnahmen sie vom Tabakkonsum abbringen, um ihren Kindern eine Rauchexposition zu ersparen.",

De hecho, casi todas las culturas disponen de una droga que acompaña sus rituales sociales, religiosos, o ambos. El ejemplo más cercano se nos presenta en la transformación del vino en la liturgia católica.El consumo de drogas viene condicionado por la interación individuo/ambiente, con toda su complicidad cultural, educativa, consumista, etc. Su prevención es, por tanto, de enorme complejidad y supone una confluencia de esfuerzos entre las diferentes estructuras sociales, que van desde procedimientos legales hasta programas educativos, campañas de consumo, marketing, reestructuración de la economía, educación sanitaria y procedimientos individuales de tratamiento y rehabilitación.Este trabajo hace especial hincapié en los procedimientos psicológicos que deberían formar parte o tomarse en consideración en los programas educativos y de rehabilitación dirigidos a la labor preventiva.ABSTRACTProbably, human drug consumption is as old as humanity. In fact, almost all cultures dispose of some drug to accompany their social and/or religious rites, the closest example we have is the transformation of wine in the Catholic Liturgy. Drugs consumption is conditioned by the individual's interaction with the environment, in all its educational, cultural and consumer complexity. So, its prevention is enormously complex and supposes a confluence of forces between different social structures, that include legal proceedings to educational programs, consumer campaigns, marketing, economy restructuration, health education and treatment and rehabilitation individual programs. This paper enphasizes the psychological steps that must be a part of those educational and rehabilitation programs directed towards a preventive labor.PALABRAS CLAVE: Psicología ambientalconsumo de drogasabuso de drogasdependenciaprevencióncontrol contigencialcomportamiento aditivoaspectos educativosaspectos psicológicosaspectos socialesKEYWORDS: Environmental psychologydrug usedrug abusedependencepreventioncontingent controladitive behavioureducation aspectspsychological aspectssocial aspects",

      "abstract": "College students with positive (FH+) and negative (FH-) family history for heavy frequent alcohol use showed no differences in age of first drink, amount consumed then, amount currently consumed, current frequency, maximum consumed, or effect of current alcohol consumed. However, there were FH background differences in the reasons identified for ending, but not for starting, drinking episodes involving intoxication. The realization of already drinking too much ended these drinking episodes more often among FH- than for FH+ subjects. In contrast, nausea and lateness of the hour were related to the end of drinking more often for FH+ subjects.",

      "title": "Why I Smoke: Sociology of a Deadly Habit",
      "abstract": "Smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the United States. In the twenty first century everyone knows the harm that smoking can cause and yet people still willingly risk their lives for the habit. I am one of these people. I would not throw myself in front of a bus; I would not take Drano from my kitchen and choose to ingest it. One of human being's greatest instincts is survival. So why do I engage in this life threatening activity? The question cannot simply be answered in one way. There are physical, biological, social, and psychological reasons for the attraction of cigarettes. For our purposes I will use various sociological theories to understand why smoking has become such a huge force in my life and how society has played a role in this manifestation. Perhaps through researching why I smoke I will be able to see how I can stop. To people of my generation smoking carried along a million perceptions of what it symbolized. Smoking was cool and sexy. When we used to play house in third and fourth grade part of the game was to make fake cigarettes and pretend we were smokers. One of the most popular candies among my friends was candy or gum cigarettes that our parents would buy us. When my dad was a smoker I used to steal his packs and throw them away because I was taught in school how bad cigarettes were for you. As I got older and my parents became less and my peers more significant, it mattered more to me what kind of persona smoking illustrated than what I had been taught. I remember the first cigarette I ever smoked. I was in the seventh grade, twelve years old, behind a tree in my back yard with my best friend. She had smoked before, I hadn't. The girl I was with was a new friend. Until I met her I wasn't much of a rebel; I was more of a drama kid violin player who did what her mother said. This new friend was different from any I'd ever had. When she lit the cigarette and taught me how to inhale, I did not hesitate--as far as I can remember. It was too exciting; doing something I knew I shouldn't. It wasn't about smoking the cigarette, it was about what that symbolized in the life of junior high kids trying to find their place. I didn't start buying my own packs of cigarettes until the end of eighth grade. It became a pastime, a social event. We'd all go buy cigarettes after school and sit in the woods or at the park, or outside the mall and smoke them together. We'd practice how we smoked and look at ourselves in the mirror. When I was young the antismoking campaigns you see today weren't around. We knew it was bad for you but it was still cool. It said something about who you were and almost defined the kind of person or group you fit with. In ninth grade I began to be loyal to a certain brand of cigarettes, Parliament Lights. Despite what common research says I had never even seen these brands advertised before. I started smoking them because it was what all of my friends smoked not because Joe Camel told me to. Throughout my first two years of high school I was still a social smoker and could smoke and quit as many times as I wanted to. The fact of the matter is addiction sneaks up on you. Nicotine is an addictive substance. Obviously some of the reasoning for my becoming a full fledged smoker had to do with my body's dependence on the drug. At the same time cigarettes are addicting in other ways. I became socialized into and addicted to the smoking lifestyle. After all of my friends would sit down to eat, or when we were bored, upset, needed a break from work, or were drinking at a party, we would smoke a cigarette. It's a social thing. Sitting down with friends, smoking and talking is something that has occupied a great amount of time in my life. Smoking is even a way to make new friends. Asking for a lighter is a great pick up line at a bar. At Orientation before my first year of school I didn't know one single person. The boy sitting across from me at the lunch table said he was getting up to go smoke a cigarette. …",

There are several mechanisms which have been identified and proposed to explain adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes associated with maternal nicotine exposure through cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use or other smokeless routes. Nicotine replacement therapies such as gum, lozenges, patches or inhalers provide a sustained, yet lower level of nicotine compared to cigarettes. Vaping or e-cigarette aerosol may also expose the user to volatile organic compounds and heavy metals, in addition to the nicotine or other substances commonly delivered. Tobacco use not only impacts the health of the mother and fetus but carries over into the postnatal period. Many pregnant women can remain smoke free during their pregnancy but postnatal relapse rates are high.",

Harmful use of alcohol is associated\r\nwith approximately 25 per cent of our healthcare\r\nspend annually, but still it is the illegal drugs that are used by\r\na significant, but small, minority of Irish men and women that\r\ngrab the headlines. Of course, we have always had a love/hate\r\nrelationship with alcohol. We have been using and abusing it as\r\na nation for the past hundred years, albeit the level of use has\r\nescalated dramatically with the increase in disposable income\r\nof the past thirty years. From the days when alcohol was strictly\r\nconfined to public houses and off-licences or restaurants, we\r\nhave reached a point in our history when you can pop into your\r\npetrol station and buy a crate of beer for €20 without anyone\r\nraising an eyelid. For all that, the level of addiction to alcohol\r\nand of harmful use of alcohol remains fairly stable over the past\r\nthree decades, with approximately one in six alcohol drinkers\r\ndeveloping problematic use.",

With regard to this matter, the present-day employer of consumption of toxic substances proves to be worrisome for part of teens and young people. It has to do with of conducts risk that characterizes for the ingestion of important quantities of alcohol in short periods of time the weekends itself, that implies a succession of episodes of intoxication and later alcoholic abstinence. This practice causes noxious effects on health. An important element in the configuration of the perception of risk constitutes it the social performance, complex issue once his character of legal drug was given. As of the present moment the alcohol is a part of our social and cultural life, and in general an excessive permissiveness in consumption is observed and even I use too much alcoholic drinks; although, at the same time, all that sounds like alcoholism is refused.",

      "title": "Cocaethylene: When Cocaine and Alcohol Are Taken Together",
      "abstract": "Cocaine is taken frequently together with ethanol and this combination produces a psychoactive metabolite called cocaethylene which has similar properties to the parent drug and may be more cardiotoxic. Cocaethylene has a longer half-life than cocaine, so that people who combine cocaine and ethanol may experience a longer-lasting, as well as more intense, psychoactive effect. Cocaethylene is the only known instance where a new psychoactive substance is formed entirely within the body. Although known to science for decades, cocaethylene has not been extensively studied and even its metabolic pathways are not entirely elucidated. Like its parent drug, cocaethylene blocks the reuptake of dopamine and increases post-synaptic neuronal activity; the parent drug may also block reuptake of serotonin as well. Cocaethylene has been studied in animal models in terms of its pharmacology and its potential neurological effects. Since the combination of cocaine and alcohol is commonly used, it is important for clinicians to be aware of cocaethylene, its role in prolonging or intensifying cocaine intoxication, and how it may exacerbate cocaine-induced cardiovascular disorders. Most cardiac-related risk assessment tools do not ask about cocaine use, which can prevent clinicians from making optimal therapeutic choices. Greater awareness of cocaethylene is needed for clinicians, and those who use cocaine should also be aware of the potential for polysubstance use of cocaine and ethanol to produce a potentially potent and long-lasting psychoactive metabolite.",

Paradojicamente, esta dependencia dual no ha sido una prioridad de estudio para la comunidad cientifica, por lo menos hasta el momento. Actualmente, la interaccion del tabaco y el alcohol tiene en nuestra sociedad el mayor coste social y sanitario de la historia, muy por encima de los causados por otras dependencias. Sin ninguna base cientifica, muchos profesionales han considerado que el tratamiento antitabaquico en alcoholicos recientemente desintoxicados provoca recaidas etilicas. Por ello, habitualmente se pospone el tratamiento para dejar de fumar hasta el momento en que la abstinencia alcoholica esta mas consolidada. Sin embargo, aumentan las publicaciones de estudios que ponen entredicho esta creencia y cada vez es mas cuestionada la veracidad de este postulado. Cuando el abordaje terapeutico para el alcoholismo y tabaquismo es simultaneo, los resultados son mas evidentes en el caso del alcohol. Una posible explicacion de los pobres resultados en relacion al tabaco, podria residir en que hasta la fecha, los tratamientos antitabaquicos que se realizan en dichos estudios, son de baja intensidad. Quedan por tanto, cuestiones sin resolver que deberian ser prioridad de nuevos estudios, como el tipo de intervencion antitabaquica y el momento adecuado para abordar las dos dependencias.",

The main causes of drug taking, listed by the soldiers, include: stress associated with the service and noticeable pleasure. Soldiers taking drugs buy them from their civilian colleagues, from dealers in the area of the unit or the neighborhood.

      "abstract": "The nightlife scene in Slovenia occupies bars, which are open until midnight or slightly longer,\r\nclubs, which open their doors at around ten o’clock and close in the early morning hours\r\n(typically at 6 a.m.), and public events, which take place outdoors or in larger venues from ten\r\no’clock until seven in the morning. The youngest partygoers, however, rarely attend organized\r\nparties due to a lack of funds. For them, it is financially more convenient to buy alcohol\r\nin stores and settle in parks or other open spaces. Although the Restrictions on the Use\r\nof Alcohol Act strictly prohibits the sale of alcohol to persons under the age of 18, minors\r\nnevertheless find ways to get their hands on alcohol, either from older peers or because the\r\ncashier simply fails to verify their age.\r\nThe party scene comes to life mainly on Fridays and Saturdays. A typical night out for youths\r\nand young adults starts out in bars or at home. Alcohol remains the drug of choice, however,\r\npartygoers tend also to spice up their evenings with marijuana and stimulants (cocaine,\r\namphetamines, ecstasy or recent synthetic drugs such as Methylone). Bars are usually the\r\nplace to meet before setting off to clubs or public events, whereas many people end up there\r\nhaving started the evening at private parties.\r\nUsually, the first arrivals to clubs and other ‘main events’ appear at midnight or later. In order\r\nto encourage crowds to show up earlier, organizers offer discount prices on tickets and\r\ndrinks until midnight. Clubs and electronic music events tend to turn on the lights somewhere\r\nbetween six and seven in the morning and from there, the party moves to an organized\r\nor private ‘after-party’.\r\nThrough outreach work, we have recently noticed an increased awareness on the part of\r\nyoung drivers of the dangers of driving under the influence. Oftentimes, a group of young\r\npeople will tell us that each week one of them makes the necessary ‘sacrifice’ and remains\r\nsober to drive the others around for the night. Two of DrogArt’s projects are devoted to alcohol-\r\nrelated harm reduction. The Choose Yourself project takes place in high schools where\r\nwe provide valuable information to youngsters on how best to plan a safe night out and on\r\nthe main risks lurking along the road to and from the party. The After Taxi project provides\r\na system of subsidizes taxis to encourage people to use public transport instead of getting\r\nbehind the wheel of their own cars or in the passenger seat with a drunk driver. The project\r\nis a fine example of a transfer of good practices as it was originally conceived and set in motion\r\nin Italy by the Etnoblog organization and later adopted in Slovenia within the scope of\r\nthe Safe Coast project.",

      "abstract": "One person dies every six seconds from a smoking-related disease and this problem is likely to worsen. While many people try to quit smoking on their own or with using medicinal products, many of them fail. There is an ongoing debate within the public health community about e-cigarettes on whether they have a potential role in smoking cessation, whether their use can reduce harm for individual users, whether the widespread use of these devices has the potential to reduce or increase population-level harm, and how best to regulate e-cigarette use to minimize both individual and population-level harm. Although the long-term effects of e-cigarette use among smokers and non-smokers are not known, nicotine aerosol produced from a solution, rather than from burning tobacco, releases fewer harmful substances than cigarette smoke does. Some experts advocate wider availability and softer regulations regarding e-cigarette use and perceive them as having the potential to help smokers quit or switch to a harm-reducing means of consuming nicotine. Based on scientific evidence on e-cigarettes, this article explores its pros and cons to public health in order to guide practice, policy, and regulation through reviews of debate articles. 'Quit or die' is no longer the only option for those who cannot quit. Safer nicotine products offer another way. There is substantial international and independent evidence that these products are safer than cigarettes.",

Nicotine dependence among smokers is variable, and in some cases, fails to develop even after years of smoking. This variation can influence treatment outcome and presents a challenge to treatment developers. Gender differences are evident sometimes in smoking prevalence, in smoking cessation, and smoking rate. Gender, however, may be a superficial indicator; reasons for smoking, individual reactions to nicotine, and cultural sanctions and role definitions may be more influential. Analyses of individual differences should focus on identifying the underlying processes that control smoking behavior.",

      "abstract": "The current electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) format was made known to the public in recent decades. Since then, it has gained widespread popularity, particularly among adolescents. A significant portion of young people in the United States and around the world are reported to use e-cigarettes. The reasons for its popularity might be related to its many enticing flavors and being rechargeable. There are many different delivery systems and devices used for e-cigarettes. It took some time for governing organizations, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to place limitations and regulations on the distribution, advertisement, and easy access by minors. E-cigarettes have been advertised as a safer version of the typical (combustible) cigarettes. Nicotine is the main ingredient of most e-cigarettes. Small amounts of other chemicals, including heavy metals and known carcinogens, have also been detected. Evidence of the harmful nature of e-cigarettes is emerging and alarming. Short-term health effects of e-cigarette use may include oral, respiratory, and cardiac illnesses. Long-term outcomes of e-cigarette use, particularly among adolescents, are unknown. E-cigarettes may help with smoking cessation in adults, but their benefits among adolescents are lacking. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the risk factors and discuss potential complications associated with adolescent e-cigarette usage. We will also discuss the evidence for concurrent use of other legal and illegal substances with e-cigarettes. Evidence for the most effective ways for cessation is lacking, and further research is needed.",

      "title": "Role of nicotine pharmacokinetics in nicotine addiction and nicotine replacement therapy: a review.",
      "abstract": "Smoking is a complex behaviour involving both pharmacological and psychological components. Nicotine is the main alkaloid found in tobacco, and is responsible for its addictive potential. Nicotine-positive effects on mood and cognition are strong reinforcements for smokers that contribute to their addiction, and cigarette smoking is particularly addictive because inhaled nicotine is absorbed through the pulmonary venous rather than the systemic venous system, and thus reaches the brain in 10-20 seconds. As the likelihood that a substance will be abused depends on the time between administration and central reinforcement, tobacco smoking can easily become addictive. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is available in different forms (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler, sublingual tablet and lozenge), and has been shown to relieve withdrawal symptoms and to double abstinence rates compared to placebo. Most NRT forms deliver nicotine more slowly than smoking, and the increase in nicotine blood levels is more gradual. Compared to tobacco smoking or even tobacco chewing, few positive (reinforcing) effects are obtained from NRT use. Nasal spray provides faster withdrawal relief than other NRT, but compared to smoking absorption is slower and nicotine blood levels obtained are lower than with smoking. These differences in pharmacokinetic profiles compared with smoking may explain that some smokers still have difficulties quitting smoking even when using NRT (apart from psychological and/or social factors). Combination therapy (e.g., patch+gum, patch+inhaler), higher dosage, temporary abstinence or smoking reduction (using NRT to reduce smoke intake) may be needed to help more smokers to quit.",

Limited information exists about the proximal predictors of light smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes per day, particularly among college students. Participants (N = 118 young adults) completed a 7 day Tobacco Consumption Diary by recording for each cigarette smoked: time and day, location, number of people present, number of smokers present, mood, and whether alcohol was consumed. Results suggest light smoking is most strongly associated with the alcohol intake, later time of day, and multiple locations both within and outside the social context (but not at work). The amount smoked per day by light smokers does not appear to be influenced by the number of people present and number of smokers present. Overall, young adult light smokers appear to be cue oriented in their smoking similar to heavier smokers, despite lower levels of addiction and fewer cigarettes per day than heavier smokers. Light smokers may benefit from tailored intervention approaches to identifying the ideographic triggers that occur in certain locations and later time of day and are likely to include alcohol intake.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely used psychotropic drug in the world. Most of the caffeine consumed comes from coffee bean (i.e., a misnomer for the seed of Coffee plants), beverages (i.e., coffee, tea, soft drinks), in products containing cocoa or chocolate and in medications (i.e., analgesics, stimulants, weight-loss products, sports nutrition). The most prominent behavioral effects of caffeine take place over low to moderate doses are amplified alertness and attention. Moderate caffeine consumption leads very rarely to health risks. Higher doses of caffeine encourage negative effects such as anxiety, insomnia, restlessness and tachycardia. The habitual use of caffeine causes physical dependence that displays as caffeine withdrawal symptoms that harm normal functioning. Contrariwise, rarely high doses of caffeine can encourage psychotic and manic symptoms usually, sleep disturbances and anxiety. Even though caffeine does not engender life-threatening health difficulties frequently related to the utilization of drugs of addiction, for example amphetamine, cocaine and heroin, an incrementing number of clinical studies are exhibiting that some caffeine users become dependent on the drug and are unable to reduce consumption despite knowledge of recurrent health complications linked to constant use. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), includes caffeine addiction and withdrawal as mental disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies caffeine dependence as a clinical disorder. Furthermore, diagnosis process of caffeine dependence syndrome is accepted by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10). Therefore the intention of this study was to analyze the neuropsychological effects of caffeine and try to assess in which respect caffeine could be considered a potential drug of addiction.",

      "abstract": "Rates of childhood obesity have increased greatly in the past 3 decades. [1] Although the causes of this trend are multifaceted, there is growing evidence that food commercials are a major contributor. [2] Food consumption can be activated by salient environmental cues in an automatic and difficult to control way. [3] Content analyses reveal that the majority of food products promoted are energy-dense and high in fat, sugar, and/ or salt, which is in sharp contrast to (inter)national dietary guidelines. [2]Cue reactivity theory states that food cues induce craving for food and actual eating behavior owing to the presence of sensory inputs associated with past consumption. [4,5] The sight, smell, or thought of tasty food induces appetite, and insuffcient inhibitory control causes failure in inhibition, leading to increased food intake. [6,7] Impaired behavioral inhibition (ie, impulsivity) might make it more diffi cult for children to resist the temptation of energy-dense food. [8,9] Impulsivity is generally defi ned as the tendency to control, think, and plan insuffi ciently. [10] Two aspects ofimpulsivity can be distinguished: insuffi cient inhibitory behavioral control and reward sensitivity or the inability to delay reward. [11] Being able to control impulsive behaviors can be an important explanation for the individual susceptibility to food advertisements, but this has not been examined before.",

      "title": "Smoking kills (alcoholics)! shouldn't we do something about it?",
      "abstract": "In general, 'drinkers smoke', and a high proportion of the alcohol-dependent population is also nicotine-dependent. Statistically, the majority of alcoholics will die of smoking-related, rather than alcohol-related, disease. This co-dependent sub-population may have higher levels of nicotine dependence, and find smoking cessation more difficult. Major reasons are that concurrent alcohol use, and/or prior alcohol exposure, may change the reinforcing effects of nicotine, and that each drug becomes a pharmacological cue for the expectation of the other. If so, then smokers whose nicotine dependence is impacted by alcohol, represent a large and distinct sub-population in which both the therapeutic and molecular targets for smoking cessation are altered. This, in turn, has implications for the validity of animal models of nicotine reinforcement, and for the development of novel smoking cessation medications. It is no longer possible to ignore the fact that the two most prevalent and damaging addictive drugs in our society are very commonly used by the same individuals. Without a better understanding of the psychological and pharmacological interactions between alcohol and nicotine that impact dependence, we cannot hope to provide appropriate medications for this large and problematic patient group. Our intention in this opinion overview is to use the current literature to provide a framework for future studies into the impact of alcohol use on the reinforcing effects of nicotine.",

      "abstract": "Almost every former smoker has ceased smoking by himself. Everybody has collected his own experience with it and tried different methods to avoid withdrawal symptoms and the urge to start smoking again. During the last decades, many different methods for the therapy of smoking cessation have been applied. These techniques were often developed with the help of individual experiences. Many times, there is a lack of a scientific ground and verifiable investigations for these activities. The most important parameter for the smoking cessation is the clear and strong intention to quit. This intention may be supported by different methods. The mental requirements are discussed and the numerous methods and drugs available to quit smoking are described.",

      "title": "Moderate Alcohol Consumption in Later Life: Time for a Trial?",
      "abstract": "“Antonio Todde, the world's oldest man, has died just short of his 113th birthday. … Relatives said Todde attributed his longevity to a glass of red wine every day.” (BBC News, January 5, 2002) “The world's oldest man celebrated his 113th birthday on Thursday … Tanabe … believes the key to longevity is not drinking alcohol.” (http://Reuters.com, September 18, 2008) In this edition of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Lee et al.1 report a survival advantage associated with moderate alcohol consumption in later life and show that this effect is still present after adjustment for socioeconomic status and number of functional limitations. Their study is the latest piece of research to investigate the possibility that consuming alcohol at “moderate” levels—typically defined as one or two drinks per day—in later life is associated with better health outcomes than abstention. It seems clear that heavy regular or occasional (binge) drinking is harmful at all ages, and there is little controversy over the need to avoid alcohol in combination with certain medications or when operating a vehicle. A systematic review published in 2002 found insufficient evidence to specify the magnitude of risk posed by alcohol use for falls and fall injuries, functional disability, cognitive impairment, and all-cause mortality in older people2 and identified a need for more longitudinal studies. Since then, a number of longitudinal analyses have investigated relationships between moderate alcohol consumption and outcomes, including physical function,3, 4 falls (e.g.,5, 6), and cognitive function.7, 8 Most (although not all) of these studies have affirmed the presence of a protective effect on health associated with moderate alcohol consumption in later life. Furthermore, the recently published Second Expert Report of the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) stated that, although the evidence on cancer alone would justify a recommendation to avoid alcohol consumption altogether, the apparent reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease suggested an overall beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption.9 In general, the observational evidence of a J-shaped curve with alcohol consumption, with abstainers and heavier drinkers being at higher risk of adverse outcomes than moderate drinkers, is fairly consistent, and the advantage of moderate drinking is not trivial. Lee et al. estimate an odds ratio of moderate drinking, compared with no drinking, of 0.72 (95% confidence interval=0.57–0.91), even after adjustment for functional status and socioeconomic status. So why does uncertainty still appear to surround this potential benefit? Why, for example, does the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommend that people aged 65 and older limit themselves to one alcoholic drink per day, half the recommended limit for adult men younger than 65? Much of this uncertainty relates to the limitations of observational research. The difficulty of managing subtle forms of bias and confounding has led to concerns about the value of observational epidemiology in assessing small-effect lifestyle-related risks of adverse outcomes.10 This certainly applies to studies of alcohol consumption, which are particularly susceptible to bias and confounding because they rely on self-reported levels that tend to be inaccurate and are probably underestimated; at the same time, heavy or problem drinkers are less likely to participate in studies. Perhaps most significant is the suspicion that moderate drinkers differ from abstainers in ways that are difficult to account for in epidemiological modelling. For example, researchers in Australia found moderate drinking to be associated with better cognitive function throughout adult life,11 suggesting that the effect seen in old age may be due to lifelong differences between abstainers and moderate drinkers.12 Although inaccuracy in measurement (misclassification) in exposures or outcomes generally results in attenuated associations, inaccuracies in accounting for confounders can result in inflated residual effects in statistical modelling. A powerful way to deal with these problems would be to do as Lee et al. propose and conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of alcohol consumption on clinical endpoints. There are at least two important pragmatic questions that a trial could address: Should middle-aged moderate drinkers be recommended to reduce their consumption to one drink per day once they pass the age of 65, consistent with current NIAAA recommendations? Should abstainers (with no specific contraindications to alcohol consumption) be recommended to drink moderate amounts of alcohol to reap the potential health benefits? As Lee et al. point out, limited trials of the effects of alcohol consumption on health have already been conducted. A more-extensive trial could provide valuable insights into how a set dose of alcohol is related to health outcomes. Optimum levels of alcohol consumption could be identified, and specific biomarker outcomes could be used to identify likely mechanisms of effect. A trial could also help determine the health effects of different forms of alcohol identified by some13 but by no means all14 observational studies. Recent studies report a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease morbidity15 and all-cause mortality16 in those who newly begin consuming alcohol in later life, and a trial of alcohol consumption in older people would allow these findings to be verified. However, a trial would tell less about how alcohol consumption in everyday life influences health and well-being. It would not indicate, for example, what happens when people drink when they should not because they are taking prescription drugs that interact with alcohol;17 what happens when people drink in binges rather than in regular small doses, a pattern of consumption identified as harmful;18 or to what extent the social context of alcohol consumption contributes to health outcomes.19 A further challenge would be to ensure that encouraging moderate drinking did not result in heavier drinking, thus doing more harm than good overall. There are other possible approaches to this issue. Genetic variations in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (which is involved in the metabolic breakdown of alcohol) are associated with abstinence, without changes to other health behaviors. Data exploiting this “natural” or “Mendelian” randomization support the hypothesis that higher alcohol consumption results in higher blood pressure and risk of hypertension.20 Although not conclusive by itself, such an approach sidesteps some of the difficulties facing observational studies and clinical trials. A study of health outcomes in older populations with and without this mutation would go a long way toward clarifying the issue. A final question to be answered is what is meant by “moderate.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines moderate as “of medium or middling quality, size, or extent; average in intensity, difficulty, or degree.” What is probably meant, in relation to alcohol consumption, is “not excessive,”“some, but not too much”—with the implication that there is a point at which one is consuming too much. In fact the point at which “some” becomes “too much” is likely to differ depending on the outcome of interest, as the comments of the WCRF/AICR suggest. Moreover, this point will tend to shift with age, as the body undergoes age-related physiological change and as the likelihood of various types of outcome shifts—making the job of the epidemiologist trying to define safe levels all the harder. This epidemiological uncertainty is surely troublesome for clinicians who want straightforward answers to the straightforward questions posed above: “Should I encourage or discourage moderate alcohol consumption in my older patients who have no specific contraindications to alcohol consumption?” and “How much is ‘moderate’ in older people?” There is little doubt that an effective randomized controlled trial that was able to address these questions would be valuable and could have major implications for practice. If the observational effect was borne out experimentally, this might provide a useful way of improving functioning and survival in old age. In the absence of such a study, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that older adults who drink at moderate levels should cut down their consumption (if there are no specific contraindications) and insufficient evidence to recommend that abstainers should take up drinking.

      "abstract": "One of the major advances in alcohol studies over recent years has been concerned with analysis of alcohol consumption statistics. The idea that alcoholism is a discrete entity has been undermined by a second major line of advance — the survey investigation of population drinking practices. In any culture where alcohol is an accepted recreational drug, dependence on alcohol is in a statistical sense a normal condition -most people will have some degree of drive toward seeking alcohol actuated by a variety of external or internal cues. Traditionally a distinction has been made between psychological dependence and physical dependence. In Anglo-Saxon literature the 'psychopathic' alcoholic is a familiar stereotype. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms are typically experienced on waking, but with the highly dependent person careful questioning may reveal that he experiences sub-acute withdrawal during the day, or indeed wakes during the night disturbed by withdrawal symptoms.",

      "title": "Determinants of Food Choice: Relationships with Obesity and Weight Control",
      "abstract": "Abstract The decision to eat, and to eat particular foods, varies for different individuals and situations. Individual differences in food likes and desires develop throughout life because of differing food experiences and attitudes. There are many internal and external cues, not just stimulation from foods or hunger, which can trigger the immediate desire to eat or orient eating toward certain foods. Food desires and intake are an outcome of interactions between these cues and more stable individual physiological and psychological characteristics. Overweight and obese individuals show a tendency toward greater liking and selection of energy‐dense foods, which may contribute to development and maintenance of these conditions. However, although liking (pleasure from eating) is an important part of food choice, it may make only a modest contribution to overall variation in food choice and eating behaviors. Indeed, difficulties of weight control may reflect problems with cues and motivations to eat, rather than with heightened pleasure derived from eating. Paradoxically, individuals highly concerned with food intake and weight control may be particularly susceptible to thoughts, emotions, and situational cues that can prompt overeating and undermine their attempts to restrain eating. Repeat dieting, high day‐to‐day fluctuations in intakes, and attempts to enforce highly rigid control over eating all seem to be counterproductive to weight control efforts and may disrupt more appropriate food choice behaviors. Longer‐term weight maintenance solutions and programs that offer a degree of structuring of the personal food environment, while retaining flexibility in choices, therefore, may be particularly beneficial in weight management.",

Although mild or moderate substance use may be harmless and even beneficial to one’s health, substance abuse presents a host of health and safety concerns for individuals and society at large (it is associated with crime and traffic accidents, for example). Human services practitioners must be able to assess clients for substance-use disorders and have knowledge of their available treatments.

      "title": "E-cigarette effects on vascular function in animals and humans",
      "abstract": "Abstract Smoking tobacco cigarettes is a significant (cardiovascular) health risk factor. Although the number of tobacco cigarette users declined over the last decades, shisha smoking and e-cigarette vaping partially compensated for this health benefit. E-cigarettes may create highly addicted dual users (vaping and smoking). E-cigarettes seem not to represent a healthier alternative to tobacco smoking, although they may be less harmful. E-cigarette vaping causes oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and associated cardiovascular sequelae. This is primarily due to a significant overlap of toxic compounds in the vapor compared to tobacco smoke and, accordingly, a substantial overlap of pathomechanistic features between vaping and smoking. Whereas the main toxins in vapor are reactive aldehydes such as formaldehyde and acrolein, the toxic mixture in smoke is more complex, comprising particulate matter, reactive gases, transition metals, volatile organic compounds, and N-nitrosamines. However, it seems that both lifestyle drugs impair endothelial function to a quite similar extent, which may be due to the role of oxidative stress as the central pathomechanism to mediate endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage. Finally, the main selling argument for e-cigarette use that they help to quit smoking and get rid of nicotine addiction may be false because it seems that e-cigarettes instead trigger the opposite—younger entrance age and more frequent use. With our review, we summarize the adverse health impact of tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes, emphasizing the detrimental effects on endothelial function and cardiovascular health.",

GTS occurs through skin exposure to dissolved nicotine from tobacco leaves. Symptoms of GTS include weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, abdominal cramps, breathing difficulty, abnormal temperature, pallor, diarrhoea, chills, fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate, and increased perspiration and salivation. The onset of the illness is three to 17 hours after exposure and the duration of illness is one to three days. Initial treatment includes cessation of work, change of clothing, showering, fluid intake, and rest. In more extreme cases, intravenous rehydration, anti-emetics, and dimenhydrinate are administered. Protective, water-resistant clothing; chemical-resistant gloves, boots, and socks; working in dry conditions; and dimenhydrinate can reduce the likelihood of contracting GTS. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> It is important to provide education to tobacco workers and employers about GTS. An international public awareness campaign about GTS timed to coincide with the tobacco harvest, along with enforced worker safety regulations, should be undertaken to protect the health of individuals working in tobacco production.",

      "abstract": "En Espana, el consumo de alcohol se ha asociado tradicionalmente a la poblacion adulta y se ha caracterizado por la regularidad de su uso, la vinculacion a la dieta y a los acontecimientos sociales. Sin embargo, los ultimos informes del Observatorio Espanol sobre Drogas han destacado la emergencia de un nuevo patron de consumo de alcohol con una gran prevalencia entre adolescentes y jovenes adultos. Esta forma de consumir se caracteriza por la ingesta de grandes cantidades de alcohol en cortos espacios de tiempo, principalmente en fin de semana, que suele llevar a la embriaguez. La literatura anglosajona denomina mayoritariamente a este patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol binge drinking (BD) o heavy episodic drinking (HED).\nEstudios realizados recientemente mediante modelos animales apuntan a una mayor vulnerabilidad del cerebro adolescente a los efectos neurotoxicos del alcohol, debido a la importante reestructuracion estructural y funcional que sufre el cerebro durante esta etapa, que en humanos abarca la segunda decada de la vida. Ademas, parece que el patron de consumo BD puede resultar significativamente mas danino para el cerebro que el consumo regular de alcohol.\n Sin embargo, a pesar de estos preocupantes datos y de la alta prevalencia del patron BD, el estudio de las posibles consecuencias neuropsicologicas asociadas a este modo de consumo es todavia escaso, no existiendo resultados concluyentes al respecto.\n El presente estudio tiene por objetivo principal determinar las consecuencias neuropsicologicas asociadas al patron de consumo BD en estudiantes universitarios de primer ano de carrera. Para ello, administramos una amplia bateria de pruebas neuropsicologicas que nos han permitido valorar diferentes funciones cognitivas. Los resultados muestran que los jovenes BD presentan, en relacion con sus pares No BD, un menor rendimiento en tarea que impliquen: memoria de trabajo verbal, memoria declarativa episodica verbal (tanto de forma inmediata como demorado) y funcionamiento ejecutivo (mayor susceptibilidad a la interferencia proactiva, menor flexibilidad cognitiva, y mayores dificultades de planificacion). Asimismo, tambien se ha comprobado que con una historia de consumo breve (media de cuatro anos), la vulnerabilidad a los efectos neurotoxicos del alcohol entre jovenes con patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol es semejante para ambos sexos.",

      "title": "The Effects of Caloric Preload and Dietary Restraint on Smoking and Eating Behavior",
      "abstract": "Rates of smoking are elevated in eating-disordered populations, especially among females (Pomerleau & Snedecor, 2008; Klesges & Klesges, 1988). Restrained eaters ignore physiological cues of satiation and hunger, and instead attempt to employ cognitive control over decisions to eat. Additionally, they are prone to eat in a disinhibited manner after a salient emotional or food cue interrupts their restraint. This eating style is also associated with increased rates of smoking compared with the general population. Although there is a great deal of literature on the relationship between smoking and eating, the role of eating in momentary decisions regarding smoking remains to be explored. The current study tested whether a food prime, which has been found to elicit disinhibited eating in restrained eaters, could also motivate smoking as an alternative to eating. In a randomized two-arm (Prime/No-Prime) between-subjects design, it was hypothesized that smokers, particularly those high in eating restraint, receiving a food prime would be more likely to smoke than eat when given the option, compared to smokers who did not receive the food prime. Although main effects on smoking variables were not found, restraint status did moderate the effect of the food prime upon latency to first puff, number of puffs, and cigarette craving. Moreover, the moderation effect was reversed upon eating variables, suggesting that after a food prime, weight-control smokers appear to choose to smoke to prevent further food intake. This conclusion was bolstered by the finding that the moderation effect on smoking was further moderated by expectancies regarding the effect of smoking upon appetite and weight. In summary, this study identified psychological mechanisms that appear to underlie the population-based covariance between disordered eating and smoking.",

There is little research on how these behaviors intersect within a person’s life. In this dissertation, I hypothesized that behaviors that activate the neural reward system can “compete.” In Study 1, I experimentally tested if eating sweet high-fat foods acutely reduced alcohol cravings for heavy drinking adults. I found that eating sweet high-fat foods acutely reduced alcohol cravings no more than watching a neutral video. In Study 2, I observed multiple reward-related behaviors (e.g., self-affirmation, social interactions, exercise) and health-compromising behaviors (e.g., unhealthy eating, alcohol use) within the everyday lives of young adults via a 4-day ambulatory electronic diary. I found that when young adults engaged in multiple reward-related behaviors they were more likely to eat unhealthy foods in the next hour. However, when young adults engaged in reward-related behaviors that provided a sense of accomplishment they were less likely to drink alcohol in the next hour. These studies fill scientific gaps in understanding intersections between reward-related behaviors and provide insight for health behavior change. Namely, that “replacing” health-compromising behavior with other reward-related behaviors may not consistently work.",

Puffing but not inhalation became less intense as a cigarette was smoked. It was not possible to predict indices of absorption from smoking patterns. Certain smoking patterns, e.g. small puff volume, low puff frequency, short duration of inhalation and expulsion of volume between puff and inhalation, may be less harmful than others and this may explain why some individuals remain healthy despite a lifetime of smoking.",

Nicotine dependence develops over time as a person continues to use nicotine. The most commonly used tobacco product is cigarettes, but any form of tobacco use and use of e-cigarettes can lead to dependence. Nicotine dependence is a serious public health problem because it causes continued tobacco use, which is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide, causing more than 8 million deaths per year. The result of the journal review is that preventing the use of tobacco products among adolescents is critical to ending nicotine addiction worldwide. The impact caused by nicotine tends to be bad, so stopping is the way out. Different levels of influence should be considered in interventions aimed at adolescent smokers, including psychological influences, addictions, peers and parents. This review article contains about the effect of nicotine on adolescents and what strategies can be done to stop the problem.",

      "abstract": "This study explores how young people conceptualise addiction to smoking and, also the relationship between young people's addiction beliefs and intentions to smoke cigarettes. Addiction to smoking is a major health problem, not just for adults, but also for young smokers, up to 60% of whom are dependent on nicotine. However, anti-smoking prevention efforts targeted at young people generally emphasise ill-health effects and little attention is paid to addiction education which is generally considered relevant only to adult smoking and cessation efforts. Perhaps as a consequence, young people appear to have many misconceptions and unrealistic ideas about addiction, and these may possibly have influenced initial decisions to take up smoking. For example, between 50% and 60% of young smokers believe that it would be easy or very easy to stop smoking altogether if and when they choose to and the majority of daily smokers mistakenly believe that they will not be smoking for more than five years. For these young smokers, becoming addicted is often an unforeseen consequence and most are surprised to find that they cannot give up smoking as easily as they thought. The majority of addicted smokers regret ever taking up smoking but nevertheless continue to smoke cigarettes for perhaps 30 to 40 years because they find it very difficult to stop. This backdrop provides the impetus for the present study.",

An experiment is described which sought to illustrate two ways in which this phenomenon and the hypothesis are compatible. Nine male alcoholics consumed 6gm of alcohol per kg bodyweight in 16 equal doses over two days. Ratings of mood and related physiological indices were used. In the long‐term the physiological measures were elevated on the second drinking day and yet individual doses of alcohol lowered these throughout. Severely alcohol dependent subjects showed corresponding effects for subjective ratings ie long‐term mood deterioration with short‐term improvement. All subjects expected continuing to drink to be reinforcing relative to stopping. Thus alcohol may retain tension‐reducing properties, and alcoholics may expect these, even if affective state was worsened overall during a drinking bout.",

Most of today's cigarette smokers, however, use tobacco daily, at intervals of less than one hour during waking hours. Since early in the twentieth century, it has been understood that this behavior is driven largely by nicotine's pharmacological actions and has little to do with the taste of nicotine. Nicotine's role in tobacco use parallels that of morphine in the use of opium derivatives. It produces CNS reinforcing effects, tolerance and physiological dependence, pharmacological effects smokers find valuable, and pleasurable effects induced by the central actions of nicotine. Nicotine and other smoke constituents also provide sensory stimuli which become conditioned reinforcers and further strengthen tobacco self-administration.",

      "abstract": "Abstract While tobacco control experts in many developed countries announce remarkable reductions in tobacco consumption, nutrition and physical activity experts in these same countries bemoan the growing epidemic of obesity. Food and physical activity differ substantially from tobacco in that they are essential to life.Whereas the goal with tobacco control is therefore to eliminate all use, obesity control focuses on reducing some behaviors (excessive and unhealthful food intake) and increasing others (physical activity). Moreover, tobacco control involves preventing use of a single product while controlling food intake requires addressing a variety of products, and engaging in sufficient physical activity may require encouraging a range of activities and dedicating a period of time daily.",

Others who support these laws are not so altruistically motivated. Employees of law enforcement bureaus and academics who receive government grants to study drug use, for example, may gain financially from drug prohibition. But as with using drugs, using drug laws can have moral and practical side effects so destructive that they argue against ever using legal institutions in this manner. One might even say—and not altogether metaphorically—that some people become psychologically or economically addicted to drug laws.

Fundamentally it is the attribute of a substance or drug that makes it more toxic to a parasite than to the host.

The ideal is to kill or injure one organism without hurting another. The problem of selective toxicity is not limited to man but also refers to the same phenomenon in lower animal life and in plant life with regard to economic poisons.

      "abstract": "Tobacco cessation represents a multifaceted approach involving patients who often don't neatly fit into classic prototypes.Researchers found that current smokers experience a more than 10-year reduction in life expectancy compared to non-smokers, and more than half make an attempt each year, but less than 10% manage to stay smoke-free for at least 6 months.Therefore, it's recommended to employ a combination of methods and strategies, ranging from questionnaires to established medications.The role of the medical staff is and remains vital in this context.Nicotine is a potent drug due to its rapid absorption and swift diffusion into the central nervous system, and quitting nicotine leads to important consequences, such as craving, drug-seeking behaviour and withdrawal symptoms.Negative affective states also emerge, characterized by symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.Hierarchical multiple regression models have revealed that extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness and age are among the predictors of daily cigarette consumption.The authors discuss both traditional and innovative opportunities to expedite this process, while analysing the potential to enhance the compliance of healthcare providers and patients.Smoking cessation, the process of quitting smoking, can be approached through both pharmacological (medication-based) and non-pharmacological (behavioural and supportive) methods.The choice of approach or combination of approaches depends on individual preferences and needs. RezumatRenunțarea la fumat reprezintă o abordare complexă a unui pacient care adesea nu se încadrează în prototipurile clasice.Cercetările au evidențiat că fumătorii se confruntă cu o reducere de peste 10 ani a speranței de viață în comparație cu nefumătorii și mai mult de jumătate fac o încercare de a renunța în fiecare an, dar mai puțin de 10% reușesc să rămână abstinenți cel puțin 6 luni.Prin urmare, se recomandă utilizarea unei combinații de metode și strategii, de la chestionare la medicamente deja stabilite, iar rolul personalului medical este și rămâne vital în acest context.Nicotina este un drog puternic datorită absorbției și difuzării rapide în sistemul nervos central, iar renunțarea conduce la efecte secundare importante, precum dorința arzătoare, comportamentul de căutare a drogului și simptomele de sevraj.Apar și stări afective negative, caracterizate prin simptome precum depresie, anxietate, iritabilitate și insomnie.Modelele ierarhice de regresie multiplă au dezvăluit că extraversia, nevroticismul, conștiinciozitatea și vârsta se numără printre predictorii consumului zilnic de țigări.Autorii discută oportunități vechi și noi de a accelera acest proces analizând posibilitatea de a îmbunătăți complianța furnizorilor de servicii medicale și a pacienților.Procesul de renunțare la fumat, poate fi abordat atât prin metode farmacologice, cât și prin metode comportamentale și de susținere.Alegerea abordării sau combinația de abordări depinde de preferințele și nevoile individuale.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes: The Long-Term Liberal Perspective",
      "abstract": "The debate for and against making e-cigarettes available to smokers is to a large extent empirical. We do not know the long-term health effects of vaping and we do not know how smokers will respond to e-cigarettes over time. In addition to these empirical uncertainties, however, there are difficult moral issues to consider. One such issue is that many smokers in some sense choose to smoke. Though smoking is addictive and though many start young, it does not seem impossible to plan for and implement cessation. Yet many choose not to do so and we arguably have some reason to respect this choice. I propose that liberal opposition to strict tobacco control, based on respect for choice, is mitigated when e-cigarettes are available, since they are such a close substitute. Making e-cigarettes available to smokers might therefore not only enable switching in practice, but may make tougher tobacco control more justified. Another moral issue is that making e-cigarettes widely available might induce many people to vape, who would otherwise have neither vaped nor smoked. If this is so, the price of using e-cigarettes to accelerate smoking cessation may be a long-term vaping epidemic. Since vaping is less harmful than smoking, both individuals and society will have less reason to end this epidemic and so it may endure longer than the smoking epidemic would otherwise have done. This raises further questions around the weighing of reduced harm to current smokers against increased harm to future vapers. Implications: Because they are a close substitute, e-cigarettes makes tougher tobacco control more morally and politically feasible. Because e-cigarettes are less harmful than combustibles, making them available may accelerate smoking cessation but also lead to a long-term vaping epidemic, as we have less reason to combat vaping, once established. Moral evaluation of this possible scenario requires considering at least three things: (1) the cost of addiction to autonomy, in addition to health effects, (2) possible distributional effects due to differences between current smokers and future vapers, and (3) the fact that a possible vaping epidemic affects mainly future people and future society.",

Sin embargo, desafortunadamente no todos los fumadores quieren dejar de fumar.

El método de “reducción hasta dejarlo” (RDH) es una estrategia que puede ser útil en fumadores no preparados para dejar de fumar. La terapia sustitutiva con nicotina (TSN) ha demostrado ser efectiva y segura tanto en el método de reducción del consumo de tabaco como en la cesación tabáquica completa.

      "title": "Commentary on Dawkins<i>et al</i>. (2015): Electronic cigarettes - from smoking cessation to smoking sensation and back",
      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a chronic relapsing disorder, with more than half of all smokers attempting to quit each year, but with only about 7% achieving long-term abstinence 1. Cigarette smokers will continue smoking because of their addiction, and when given the options of smoking or giving up nicotine completely, many will not give it up. This rigid dichotomous scheme may now change as a result of the increasing availability of reduced risk alternatives to combustible tobacco cigarettes 2. Compared to conventional cigarettes, the emerging category of nicotine-containing products has the potential to reduce substantially the individual risk and the harm for the population 3. Among the available nicotine-containing reduced risk products, the electronic cigarette (EC) has been gaining rapidly on conventional cigarettes 4. The growing popularity of ECs proves that many adult smokers are now ready for new, alternative, technological forms of smoking. Currently, users report the long-term use of EC to reduce cigarette consumption or quit smoking to relieve tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and to continue having a 'smoking' experience 5. Moreover, the popularity of ECs appears to be associated with the fact that they can be used in many smoke-free areas, their prices are competitive and they are perceived to be a much less harmful smoking alternative 6-8, given that vapour toxicology is far less problematic than tobacco cigarette toxicology 9. Although the high rate of ECs trials demonstrates the strong latent demand for less harmful nicotine-containing products, at present there is a low rate of conversion from trial to usage of these products. This is an indication that the current generation of ECs are not yet fit to bring about a fulfilling smoking experience. When considering the appeal of ECs it is important to highlight design varieties among products. For example, first-generation devices consisting of small rechargeable batteries and disposable cartridges designed to look like conventional cigarettes ('cigalikes') allow only a limited number of puffs (requiring frequent recharging) and a narrow range in flavour assortment. Moreover, 'cigalikes' are not very efficient at delivering nicotine 10. Second-generation devices, instead, are equipped with higher-capacity lithium batteries, much more efficient vaporizing systems and tanks that can be refilled with a countless variety of flavoured liquids. Moreover, nicotine delivery to the bloodstream using second-generation devices is, by and large, superior compared to current 'cigalikes' 11, 12. Presumably, second-generation devices allow a more fulfilling vaping experience compared to 'cigalikes', as shown by their high adoption rates in first-time users not intending to quit 13. In this issue of the Journal, Dawkins and colleagues 14 are advancing current understanding by exploring diversities and similarities between first- and second-generation ECs in terms of smokers' preference and subjective effects. In spite of a number of study limitations, some findings are of great interest. Half of smokers chose a first-generation EC because of its resemblance to a conventional cigarette and the other half a second-generation EC for the opposite reason: it did not look like a conventional cigarette and was more stylish. Clearly, cigarette-like cues have different (positive versus negative) significance for different smokers, so that their personal preference for a specific device will be dictated by a trade-off between positive and negative values. Thus, it was not surprising that none of the standard independent variables used for the regression analyses could predict device choice. Both first- and second-generation ECs were equally effective at reducing urge to smoke and withdrawal symptoms in first-time users. Although not measured specifically in this study, similar nicotine absorption with both devices could have been achieved in these first-time users. Moreover, it is also possible that positive qualities of the specific 'cigalike' used for these experiments (e.g. 'throat hit' similar to that delivered by second-generation EC) were sufficient to control symptoms in inexperienced users. Therefore, the working hypothesis that second-generation ECs are superior to 'cigalike' may be an oversimplification, and requires careful consideration of the dynamic interplay among specific products and individual smoking phenotypes. Although replication of Dawkins' findings in a less selective population sample and with a large assortment of ECs models will be required, the data presented here still support the notion that these products may constitute valid conventional cigarette substitutes. However, currently available ECs require further improvement, so that users' smoking experience could be as fulfilling as possible. It is ironic, but the extent of displacement from tobacco smoking to regular vaping will also depend upon how good ECs will become in replicating smokers' smoking experience. In fact, substantial public health benefits (i.e. increase in smoking cessation rates and a continued decline in smoking prevalence) are now reported in countries with a high vaping prevalence 15. By exploring diversities and similarities among first- and second-generation ECs, we are now beginning to learn that the extent of smoking abstinence is connected intimately with their role as smoking sensation products, where smoking cessation is the main 'collateral benefit' for many smokers switching to regular ECs use. Therefore, it is important to re-evaluate the sensorial attributes that can make the users' vaping experience more fulfilling, to learn why smokers buy these products, which factors facilitate or hinder use under realistic conditions and what are the products' features leading to negative and/or positive users' perceptions. This knowledge may prove helpful to product developers, researchers, policymakers, regulators, health-care providers and consumers.

Tu referujeme šesť letálnych prípadov intoxikácií etylalkoholom. Prvá kazuistika sa venuje žene, ktorá v opitosti umiera v herni. Druhý prípad uvádza muža, ktorý v opitosti umiera pri rybníku. Tretí opisuje priebeh výletu spojeného s pitím a úmrtím muža v aute. Štvrtý prípad je založený na báze celodenného popíjania a následným úmrtím muža. Piaty prípad opisuje priebeh bujarej oslavy, ktorá sa končí úmrtím muža. Posledný šiesty prípad dokumentuje ťažkú otravu muža alkoholom, ktorý v kombinácii s požitím kanabinoidov umiera na lavičke autobusovej stanice. Sú diskutované príčiny a dôvody vedúce k takýmto tragickým udalostiam. Upozorňuje sa na nebezpečenstvá, ktoré vyplývajú z nárazového pitia príležitostných konzumentov a tiež na nebezpečenstvá nárazového pitia osôb, ktoré dlhodobo v nadmerných dávkach užívajú alkoholické nápoje. Zvlášť je diskutovaná prevencia užívania alkoholických nápojov detí a mládeže, včítane prevencie alkoholizmu. Sú navrhnuté edukačné programy, ktoré by mohli odtabuizovať túto problematiku a v rámci toho formovať postoje detí, mládeže i dospelých na pitie alkoholu aj s očakávaním zníženia prípadov úmrtí intoxikáciou etylalkoholom v budúcnosti.",

      "title": "Alcohol withdrawal: an adaptation to heavy drinking of no practical significance?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Markedly differing views can be found among both clinicians and researchers regarding whether alcohol withdrawal is a phenomenon of any practical or theoretical importance. Evidence has mounted that alcohol withdrawal, even in a severe form, is rarely life–threatening and the great majority of cases can be managed in non–medical settings, including the home. There is also a widely held view among clinicians that withdrawal symptoms have little motivational significance and may be best regarded as but epiphenomena of prolonged heavy drinking. There are also experimental data from both human and animal laboratory studies to the effect that withdrawal symptoms do not readily trigger further alcohol consumption. Against this most unpromising background a case is presented for alcohol withdrawal being but one manifestation of important biological and psychological adaptive processes which occur almost whenever alcohol is consumed with any regularity. It is proposed that understanding this more general phenomenon is critical to a better understanding of the factors which maintain heavy and problematic drinking. Recent evidence also suggests that minor alcohol withdrawal symptoms are far more common in the general population than had previously been realized, and that this has important implications for prevention policy.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of premature death, and it is currently listed as a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Because of restrictive measures and widespread control policies, tobacco companies are now using aggressive marketing strategies in favor of smokeless tobacco, including electronic nicotine delivery systems, which are also known as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Although the regular use of these devices appears less hazardous than traditional cigarettes or other forms of smokeless tobacco, recent studies have shown that various potentially harmful substances, especially nicotine, ultraparticles, and volatile organic compounds, may be effectively inhaled or liberated in exhaled air during repeated e-cigarette puffing. This would enhance the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, which may predispose some users to increased risk of cardiovascular events, which may be further magnified by other potential adverse effects such as arrhythmias, increased respiratory, and flow respiratory resistance. Some cases of intoxication have also been described, wherein large amounts of nicotine and other harmful compounds may be effectively absorbed. As the use of e-cigarettes is continuously rising, and it is also considered a potentially effective method for smoking cessation, more focused research is urgently needed to definitely establish the cardiovascular safeness of these devices.",

      "title": "Tobacco based dentifrices: still not squeezed out",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Thirty-five percent adults (274.9 million) consume tobacco in India in some form or other with 21% (163.7 million) adults using only smokeless tobacco, 9% (68.3 million) only smoking and 5% (42.3 million) users of both smoking and smokeless tobacco.[1] The history and cultural rooting of smokeless tobacco when compared to smoking represents a distinctive challenge in India's tobacco control measures. The usage of tobacco based dentifrice may sound improbable and odd but it is very frequently practiced in rural areas of South Asia. The overall national prevalence of usage of tobacco based dentifrices was found to 5% in patients aged above 15 years in India.[1] However, tobacco based dentifrices are worryingly more frequently used by females (6.3%) in contrast to males (3.3%) and are also popular in children, thus posing a unique conundrum to tobacco control advocates.[12] Tobacco toothpaste (creamy snuff) and tooth powder are perhaps the most commonly marketed tobacco based dentifrices.[2] The various other tobacco based dentifrices used commonly are Gul (a pyrolyzed tobacco product), mishri (roasted and powdered tobacco), gudakhu (paste of tobacco and molasses), tapkeer (dry powdered snuff) and tobacco water (manufactured by passing tobacco smoke through water used only for gargling) that are commonly used in various parts of rural Asia.[1] The presence of nicotine in these dentifrices, even in small quantities, could lead to addiction and these dentifrices can lead to pathologies in oral cavity such as abraded teeth, dentinal hypersensitivity, pulpitis, teeth staining, gingival recession and oral mucosal premalignant lesions.[2] The usage of tobacco based dentifrices should be dealt with more seriousness and should be dissuaded sharply. There is a need to develop evidence based, culturally appropriate economic intervention for control of tobacco based dentifrice usage and an analysis of motivating influences for its practise should be conducted as there is a lack of research on factors leading to its usage.[3] Overall, the public health challenge of smokeless tobacco (especially tobacco based dentifrices) merits far greater interest and action than it has so far received.[4] Though there is a legislative ban of usage of tobacco in dentifrices, the effectiveness of this ban needs to be implemented properly as there is an easy availability of these dentifrices.[5] Moreover, the perceived prevalent misconceptions about efficacious use of tobacco based dentifrices in teeth cleaning need to be dismissed. Tobacco industries also deceptively market their products as herbal based, mouth freshener, and teeth whiteners that further increases the vulnerability of the less educated residents in rural areas. Growing prevalence of tobacco related cancers can be controlled only if there is a greater sustained public awareness about manifold risks of tobacco in its various forms and a better scrutiny of tobacco based dentifrices, especially in rural areas.",

      "title": "Terapi Kecanduan Rokok dengan Menggunakan Metode Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (Seft)",
      "abstract": "Penelitian ini dilatarbelakangi oleh adanya aktifitas merokok dikalangan para remaja sudah tidak bisa di hindarkan lagi, ada yang merokok di usia yang masih muda yaitu 10 tahun (Aditama, 2006). Perilaku kecanduan di kalangan remaja mengalami peningkatan (Riska Rosita, 2012) seringkali kita melihat pemandangan siswa yang merokok di sekitar kita. Mereka secara sembunyi sembungi atau terang terangan merokok dan banyak di jumpai di sekolah, di warung- warung tempat mereka jajan, tempat nongkrong bersama teman-temannya, di kampus, di pasar, bahkan di rumah. Aktifitas remaja lebih banyak dilakukan di luar rumah bersama dengan teman-teman sebaya sebagai kelompok, kalau dilihat pengaruh teman sebaya itu lebih besar dibandingkan dengan pengaruh dari keluarga, jika ada teman sebayanya merokok maka dapat di pastikan remaja dan mahasiswa tersebut juga merokok karna kesempatan untuk diterima oleh kelompoknya lebih besar (Hurlock, Elizabeth B. 1980). Dilihat dari segi kesehatan merokok yang berasal dari logam berat yang berbahaya (Sitepoe 9, 2000) adalah penyumbang terbesar terhadap berbagai penyakit yang bisa mengakibatkan kematian, Penyakit tersebut antara lain adalah kanker mulut, esophagus, paru, pancreas, faring, laring dan kandung kemih. Juga ditemukan berbagai penyakit paru lainnya, seperti penyakit paru obstruktif kronis, penyakit pembuluh darah, dan jantung coroner, gangguan kehamilan, impotensi dan sebagainya (Davison, Gerald D. 2010). Apalagi perilaku merokok disertai dengan minuman keras (Nurrahmah, 2014). Di Amerika sebanyak 701 kematian akibat merokok pertahun (M. Ayus Astoni & Mohammad Zulkarnain 1998) dan di Indonesia diperkirakan 70 % kematian akibat merokok (Detik Health, Desember 2003). Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan semi eksperimental. Dengan mengujicobakan model terapi SEFT pada remaja dan mahasiswa yang kecanduan merokok. Sumber data adalah Remaja pada tingkat SMP dan SMU di Sekolah Yayasan Al- Ghifari Bandung. Tujuan yang ingin di capai dalam penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui proses terapi kecanduan rokok dengan menggunakan metode Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT), untuk mengetahui hasil dari terapinya terhadap remaja yang merokok sebagai solusi pada Remaja yang masih melakukan kebiasaan merokok untuk memberikan terapi alternative yang sudah kecanduan Merokok dan untuk mengetahui apa saja kendala dalam proses penyembuhan dari kecanduan merokoknya. Hasil pembahasan menunjukan bahwa Terapi Kecanduan Merokok dengan menggunakan Metode Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT) yaitu dengan tiga cara Set Up, Tune In dan Tapping serta dengan Spiritualitas dari Yakin Khusyuk, Ikhlas, Pasrah dan Syukur (YKIPS) di Kalangan Remaja dapat ditanggulangi dan dapat disembuhkan dengan menggunakan terapi Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (SEFT) yang dilakukan sekitar 10 menit sampai 1 jam dengan reaksi rasa mual, muntah, mulut terasa pahit, pusing, batuk – batuk dan tidak enak. Kendala yang dihadapi dalam terapi SEFT adalah kalau tidak ada motivasi ingin berhenti dari kecanduan merokok biasanya setelah beberapa hari kembali lagi merokok walaupun rasanya sudah tidak enak, tetapi kalau keinginan ingin berhenti kuat bisa sembuh secara permanen.",

      "abstract": "Ältere Menschen sind in hohem Ausmaß von den gesundheitlichen Folgen des Rauchens betroffen. Dennoch haben bis in die jüngste Vergangenheit Politik und Gesundheitsversorgung den älteren Rauchern wenig Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet. Dies beginnt sich zu ändern angesichts der wachsenden Zahl von alternden aktiven Rauchern im mittleren Lebensabschnitt und der wachsenden Erkenntnisse über den gesundheitlichen Nutzen der Raucherentwöhnung auch im Alter. Gleichwohl sind die Angebote für ältere Raucher häufig unzureichend. Unzutreffende Informationen und Mythen scheinen in den Überzeugungen und Einstellungen sowohl der älteren Raucher wie auch der Professionellen im Gesundheitswesen tief verwurzelt. Im Gegensatz zu diesen Mythen gilt es folgende Fakten festzuhalten: Rauchen hat keinerlei Nutzen, es verbessert weder die geistige Leistungsfähigkeit noch die Stimmung; im Gegenteil führt ein Rauchstopp auch bei gebrechlichen alten Menschen zu signifikanten Verbesserungen von gesundheitlicher Verfassung und Lebensqualität; das Rauchen von «light» Zigaretten oder die Reduzierung der Zigarettenzahl verringert nicht die Gesundheitsschäden. Es ist wichtig, über den gesundheitlichen Nutzen der Raucherentwöhnung im Alter zu informieren sowie Empfehlungen und Unterstützung für Rauchstoppversuche zu geben. In der Altersmedizin sollte der Raucherstatus aller Patienten routinemäßig festgehalten werden, Raucher sollten beim Rauchstopp beraten und medikamentös behandelt sowie weiter begleitet werden. Die Mehrheit der älteren Raucher in Deutschland möchte das Rauchen aufgeben und hat dies wiederholt erfolglos versucht. Besonders komorbide Risikopatienten, deren Zahl durch den demografischen Wandel weiter steigen wird, sind motiviert und würden besonders von einer effizienten Raucherentwöhnung profitieren. Die aktuelle Forschung zeigt, dass ein hoher Anteil ältere Raucher, insbesondere anlässlich einer stationärer Behandlung aufgrund kardiovaskulärer Erkrankungen, erfolgreich aufhören kann, wenn ihnen entsprechende Interventionen angeboten werden. Dieser Artikel gibt einen Überblick über Epidemiologie und gesundheitliche Folgen des Rauchens sowie über die Nikotinabhängigkeit und erläutert den aktuellen Stand von Forschung und Praxis der Raucherentwöhnung im Alter einschließlich möglicher Begleiteffekte wie Depression und Gewichtszunahme.",

Equally, public policy attempts to resolve the challenge of smoking have been distorted by a 'right to smoke' lobby. The injection of funds by tobacco companies to promote smoking amongst new populations of smokers (e.g. young adult women) has provided an additional challenge to public health professionals. As the limits of 'abstinence' programmes may have been reached, a renewed focus on 'controlled (attenuated) smoking' interventions is highly appropriate for chronic, treatment-rejecting smokers who refuse to quit completely.",

Using longitudinal data on teens from all 50 United States from 1988 to 1992, we find a significant causal role for endogenous past cigarette consumption even after controlling extensively for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. We also find measurable evidence of different sensitivities to cigarette price depending on past use. These two findings suggest that a cigarette price increase will have a larger aggregate effect in the long run than in the short run as more individuals accumulate in the price-sensitive nonsmoking group.",

      "title": "Nuevas y viejas adicciones: implicaciones para la salud pública",
      "abstract": "Según algunos autores, cualquier conducta placentera podría ser susceptible de convertirse en hábito y, según las circunstancias, en dependencia. El objetivo de este trabajo es realizar un repaso de la situación de las adicciones en España y de las respuestas en políticas de salud que se han desplegado. En los últimos años España ha experimentado un notable cambio en el tipo y en los patrones de consumo de sustancias psicoactivas. La evolución del consumo del tabaco sugiere que el pico de la epidemia ya ha pasado, aunque la prevalencia es aún alta. El consumo per capita de alcohol en los últimos 25 años se ha reducido en un 25%. Durante el mismo período, el patron de consumo se ha modificado. El consumo esporádico, en episodios de «atracones» y la ingesta fuera de las comidas, se ha revelado como uno de los patrones en alza. Según el Observatorio Europeo de las Drogas y las Toxicomanías, en España el 27,8% de la población comprendida entre los 15 y los 64 años ha consumido una droga ilícita al menos una vez en su vida y esta prevalencia era del 38% en la población de 15 a 34 años. El cannabis es la sustancia más consumida (29% de la población de 15-64 años), seguida por la cocaína (5,9%) y el éxtasis (4,6%). España es el tercer país de la Unión Europea en consumo de cannabis, éxtasis y anfetaminas y el primero en consumo de cocaína. Con respecto a las denominadas adicciones comportamentales, no existe consenso en el campo de la psiquiatría. La única adicción psicológica con criterios diagnósticos claros es el juego patológico, el resto (Internet, sexo, etc.), probablemente por su novedad, sigue siendo objeto de controversia. Las nuevas adicciones, tanto las producidas por nuevas sustancias como las del comportamiento, van en paralelo al desarrollo de las sociedades industrializadas, al ocio, al tiempo libre y a una nueva forma de vida. Éste es un nuevo reto para la salud pública. According to certain authors, any pleasure giving behaviour may become a habit, and depending on the circumstances, an addiction. The objective of this study is to examine the situation of addictions in Spain and the responses generated by health policies. In recent years, both the type and pattern of drug consumption in Spain, has undergone a noticeable change. Studies of the evolution of tobacco consumption suggest that the peak has passed, even though prevalence is still high. Alcohol consumption per capita has fallen by 25% in the last 25 years. During the same period, pattern of consumption has been modified. Sporadic drinking, in episodes of binging and drinking away from meals, is one of the patterns on the rise. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in Spain, 27.8% of the population between 15- 64 years old has consumed an illegal drug at least once in their lives, with the prevalence rising to 38% among the 15- 34 year olds. Cannabis is the most consumed (29% among 15–64 age group), followed by cocaine (5.9%), and ecstasy (4.6%). Spain, comparing with other countries of European Union, is the third in cannabis, ecstasy, and amphetamine and the first in cocaine consumption. With respect to the so-called behavioral addictions, no consensus in the field of psychiatry has been reached. The only psychological addiction with clear diagnostic criteria is gambling. The rest (Internet, sex, etc.), perhaps for their novelty, continue to be the object of controversy. New addictions, as much to addictive substances as to addictive behaviors, run parallel to the development of industrialized societies, leisure, free time, and a new way of life. This is the new challenge for Public Health.",

      "title": "Nicotine as an Addictive Substance: A Critical Examination of the Basic Concepts and Empirical Evidence",
      "abstract": "The present review is a critical analysis of the concepts behind and the empirical data supporting the view that tobacco use represents an addiction to nicotine. It deals with general aspects of the notion of addiction, while concentrating on specific problems associated with incorporating nicotine into current frameworks. The notion of addiction suffers from unprecedented definitional difficulties. The definitions offered by various authorities are very different, even contradictory. Definitions that reasonably include nicotine are so broad and vague that they allow many trivial things, such as salt, sugar, and watching television, to be considered addictive. Definitions that exclude the trivia also exclude nicotine. The addiction hypothesis, in general, is strongly shaped by views that certain drugs bring about a molecular level subversion of rationality. The main human evidence for this is verbal reports of smokers who say that they can't quit. On the other hand, the existence of many millions of successful quitters suggests that most people can quit. Some smokers don't quit, but whether they can't is another matter. The addiction hypothesis would be greatly strengthened by the demonstration that any drug of abuse produces special changes in the brain. It has yet to be shown that any drug produces changes in the brain different from those produced by many innocuous substances and events. The effects of nicotine on the brain are similar to those of sugar, salt, exercise, and other harmless substances and events. Apart from numerous conceptual and definitional inadequacies with the addiction concept in general, the notion that nicotine is addictive lacks reasonable empirical support. Nicotine does not have the properties of reference drugs of abuse. There are so many findings that conflict so starkly with the view that nicotine is addictive that it increasingly appears that adhering to the nicotine addiction thesis is only defensible on extra-scientific grounds.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period associated with rapid age-specific physiological, neural, and hormonal changes. Behaviorally, human adolescents are characterized by age-typical increases in novelty seeking and risk taking, including the frequent initiation of alcohol and drug use. Alcohol use typically begins during early adolescence, and older adolescents often report high levels of alcohol consumption, commonly referred to as high-intensity drinking. Early-onset and heavy drinking during adolescence are associated with an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorders later in life. Yet, long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent alcohol use that might contribute to excessive drinking in adulthood are still not well understood. Recent animal research, however, using different exposure regimens and routes of ethanol administration, has made substantial progress in identifying the consequences of adolescent ethanol exposure that last into adulthood. Alterations associated with adolescent ethanol exposure include increases in anxiety-like behavior, impulsivity, risk taking, and ethanol intake, although the observed alterations differ as a function of exposure regimens and routes of ethanol administration. Rodent studies have also shown that adolescent ethanol exposure produces alterations in sensitivity to ethanol, with these alterations reminiscent of adolescent-typical ethanol responsiveness. The goal of this mini-review is to summarize the current state of animal research, focusing on the long-term consequences related to adolescent ethanol exposure, with a special emphasis on the behavioral alterations and changes to ethanol sensitivity that can foster high levels of drinking in adulthood.",

The manner that dietary acids are introduced into the mouth (gulping, sipping, use of a straw) will affect how long the teeth are in contact with the erosive challenge. The frequency and duration of exposure to an erosive agent is of paramount importance. Night-time exposure (e.g. baby bottle-feeding) to erosive agents may be particularly destructive because of the absence of salivary flow. Health-conscious individuals tend to ingest acidic drinks and juices more frequently and tend to have higher than average oral hygiene. While good oral hygiene is of proven value in the prevention of periodontal disease and dental caries, frequent toothbrushing with abrasive oral hygiene products may enhance erosive tooth wear. Unhealthy lifestyles such as consumption of designer drugs, alcopops and alcohol abuse are other important behavioral factors.",

      "abstract": "E-cigarettes are 95% less harmful to your health than normal cigarettes. When supported by a smoking cessation service, they help most smokers to quit tobacco altogether.\r\n\r\nKey messages:\r\n1. Smokers who have tried other methods of quitting without success could be encouraged to try e-cigarettes (EC) to stop smoking and stop smoking services should support smokers using EC to quit by offering them behavioural support. \r\n\r\n2. Encouraging smokers who cannot or do not want to stop smoking to switch to EC could help reduce smoking related disease, death and health inequalities. \r\n\r\n3. There is no evidence that EC are undermining the long-term decline in cigarette smoking among adults and youth, and may in fact be contributing to it. Despite some experimentation with EC among never smokers, EC are attracting very few people who have never smoked into regular EC use. \r\n\r\n4. Recent studies support the Cochrane Review findings that EC can help people to quit smoking and reduce their cigarette consumption. There is also evidence that EC can encourage quitting or cigarette consumption reduction even among those not intending to quit or rejecting other support. More research is needed in this area. \r\n\r\n5. When used as intended, EC pose no risk of nicotine poisoning to users, but e-liquids should be in ‘childproof' packaging. The accuracy of nicotine content labelling currently raises no major concerns. \r\n\r\n6. There has been an overall shift towards the inaccurate perception of EC being as harmful as cigarettes over the last year in contrast to the current expert estimate that using EC is around 95% safer than smoking. \r\n\r\n7. Whilst protecting non-smoking children and ensuring the products on the market are as safe and effective as possible are clearly important goals, new regulations currently planned should also maximise the public health opportunities of EC. \r\n\r\n8.

Dit leidt tot dik, slijmerig speeksel, wat ook een droog gevoel kan geven. Naast de sport zelf veroorzaken diverse prestatiebevorderende middelen zoals amfetaminen, diuretica en astmamedicijnen een droge mond. Monddroogte maakt sporters gevoeliger voor caries en tanderosie.

      "abstract": "Die gesundheitlichen Schaedigungen infolge Alkohol- und Cannabiskonsum werden im Einzelnen diskutiert. Es hat sich eindeutig herauskristallisiert, dass beide Suchtstoffe in Mengen genossen aeusserst schaedlich sind und zum Tode fuehren koennen. Die Todesrate durch Alkohol ist zweifelsohne gross. Von Cannabis wird nur in einzelnen Faellen auf moegliche Herzkomplikationen hingewiesen, die toedlich sein koennten. Wodurch Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) aber zum Tod fuehren kann, ist die enorme Beguenstigung des Suizids. Die Ausloesung psychogener Ausnahmesituationen, zum Beispiel mit Verfolgungswahn, kann das Ergebnis von Cannabiskonsum sein. Aber auch geringe Dosen Cannabis oder der erstmalige Konsum haben unter Umstaenden ganz erhebliche Fehl- und Angstreaktionen zur Folge. Schliesslich ist die Krebsgenese durch das Rauchen von Marihuana oder Haschisch etwa um das Vierfache groesser als durch den Genuss normaler Zigaretten. Insgesamt ist die Todesrate bei chronischen Alkoholkonsumenten grosser Quantitaeten immer noch erheblich groesser als die durch den Genuss von THC. Anders ist es bei der Einnahme von kleinen Mengen. Hier gefaehrdet Alkohol nur in seltenen Faellen die Gesundheit, waehrend Cannabis nicht selten bereits beim ersten Mal oder in den folgenden Rauscherlebnissen psychische Stoerungen ausloest. Mit der relativ niedrigen Konzentration von weniger als 5 ng THC/ml Blutserum sind die psychischen Beeintraechtigungen ohne koerperliche Ausfallerscheinungen derart gross, dass es zu schweren, sogar toedlichen Verkehrsunfaellen kommt. 5 Nanogramm THC in einem Milliliter Blutserum entsprechen ungefaehr einer Blutalkoholkonzentration von 0,5 Promille. Eine zitierte Untersuchung stellte fest, dass bei Verkehrsunfaellen unter Cannabiseinwirkung 65,5 Prozent der Fahrer einen THC-Gehalt von unter 5 Nanogramm hatten, sie haetten damit allgemein unter der relativen Fahruntuechtigkeit von 0,5 Promille im Blut gelegen.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol abuse is widespread among all the peoples and cultures nowadays. In modern society alcoholism is not viewed as a disease any longer; it is more considered a behavioural disorder caused by dynamic and stressful life relations where alcohol abuse turns to be a lifestyle. Alcohol is the most commonly used drug among the young, which is not illegal, but it is illegal and forbidden for those who are under age. The reasons for alcohol consumption among the young are numerous: boredom, desire to be different or to be accepted by peers, fear of not belonging to a group or hope that it brings feeling of relaxation and joy, bad family relations with lack of communication, alienation and parents' attitude towards drinking alcohol and so on. All these have a great impact on young people's behaviour. Alcohol can cause permanent serious consequences if it is abused at an early age. A lot of research on alcohol abuse among the young has been done in the world as well as in our country. According to the alarming research statistics more and more youngsters start abusing alcohol sooner than ever before. The purpose of this paper is to present alcohol drinking among the young as a community health problem, to point at consequences of alcohol abuse and its harmful impact on human organism and to emphasize the role of a nurse in carrying out preventive programmes in kindergardens, primary and secondary schools.",

      "title": "Die E-Zigarette – Mittel zur Tabakentwöhnung?",
      "abstract": "After several years of declining tobacco consumption, the number of smokers in Germany is currently stagnating or rising again. The reasons seem to be manifold, e. g. stress caused by the pandemic with social isolation, rising cost of living and war in Europe.With tobacco use still widespread in the German population, evidence-based tobacco cessation is rarely implemented.According to recent studies, e-cigarettes are involved in the pathogenesis of lung disease, cardiac and vascular damage. In addition, their ingredients also have carcinogenic effects. However, clinical studies on long-term use are not yet available.E-cigarettes as a consumer product are not superior to nicotine replacement products and addiction-reducing medications recommended in guidelines. In the therapeutic setting, they are slightly more effective than nicotine replacement products. However, they are usually consumed continuously and thus perpetuate nicotine dependence. Their use increases the risk of relapse to tobacco smoking.Despite the various new approaches, such as Internet-based offerings, app, etc., talks and pharmacotherapy are the gold standard and more effective than any therapy on its own.TABAKENTWöHNUNG IN DEUTSCHLAND.: Nachdem der Tabakkonsum über mehrere Jahre rückläufig war, zeigt sich aktuell eine Stagnation bzw. ein Wiederanstieg der Rauchenden in Deutschland. Die Ursachen erscheinen vielfältig, wie z. B. Belastungen durch die Pandemie mit der sozialen Isolation, steigende Lebenshaltungskosten und Krieg in Europa. Bei einem weiterhin stark verbreiteten Tabakkonsum in der deutschen Bevölkerung wird eine evidenzbasierte Tabakentwöhnung nur selten durchgeführt. GESUNDHEITSRISIKEN DER E-ZIGARETTE.: Nach neueren Studien sind E-Zigaretten an der Pathogenese von Lungenerkrankungen, Herz- und Gefäßschädigungen beteiligt. Zudem wirken ihre Inhaltsstoffe auch karzinogen. Klinische Untersuchungen zum dauerhaften Konsum liegen aber bisher nicht vor. WIE WIRKSAM IST DIE E-ZIGARETTE BEI DER TABAKENTWöHNUNG?: E-Zigaretten als Konsumentenprodukt sind den in Leitlinien empfohlenen Nikotin-Ersatzpräparaten und suchthemmenden Medikamenten nicht überlegen. Im therapeutischen Setting sind sie etwas besser wirksam als Nikotin-Ersatzpräparate. Sie werden aber meistens dauerhaft konsumiert und verstetigen so die Nikotinabhängigkeit. Ihr Konsum erhöht die Rückfallgefahr zum Tabakrauchen. EVIDENZBASIERTE TABAKENTWöHNUNG AMBULANT UND STATIONäR.: Trotz der verschiedenen neuen Ansätze, wie Internet-basierte Angebote, App etc., sind Gespräche und Pharmakotherapie der Goldstandard und wirksamer als jede Therapie für sich allein.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is the most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. In just a few short years, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become increasingly popular, especially for younger individuals. Many people believe that e-cigarettes are safe. The inhaled aerosols of e-cigarettes contain numerous potential toxicities, some of which could be dangerous for health with long-term use. The safety of prolonged aerosol exposure is not known. The use of e-cigarettes as a harm-reduction tool at stopping tobacco smoking is not uniformly successful. E-cigarettes may be safer than tobacco products, but repeated prolonged exposure to their aerosols has its own considerable potential risk. The long-term health consequences of their use remain to be established. Physicians should vigorously discourage the use of e-cigarettes and tobacco products, with special emphasis on abstinence for younger people and during pregnancy or lactation.",

Cannabis use during adolescence can cause functional and structural changes to the developing brain, leading to damage.

      "abstract": "Despite the fact that cannabis is prohibited in Australia, more than one million people aged 14 years or older use it at least once a week. These frequent users are more at risk of suffering the harms associated with cannabis use than infrequent users. This report is an exploratory investigation into factors which might encourage regular cannabis users to stop or reduce their consumption of cannabis. The study results indicate that, while being arrested or imprisoned may discourage cannabis use, such measures are less likely to reduce consumption among frequent cannabis users than among those who use cannabis only infrequently. Frequent cannabis users, on the other hand, are more likely than occasional cannabis users to say that they would seek treatment if one were available. The study also finds evidence that regular cannabis users would respond to a shortage of cannabis, or an increase in the cost of cannabis, by switching to other drugs such as tobacco.",

Alcohol is having varying impact on health of people. Short-term effects include motor vehicle accidents, violence, injuries, and risky sexual behavior while long-term effects include carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, gastric ulcer, pancreatitis etc (2). Alcohol consumption is a major Public health Challenge. In India 18.8% males and 1.3% females above age of 15 years were consuming alcohol according to NFHS-5 Survey (3). In India different states are having different age limits for alcohol purchase and consumption. Although legal age for alcohol consumption in India varies from 18-25 years of age. States like Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland and union territory of Lakshadweep and Manipur has complete ban on sale &amp; purchase of same (4). Although some rules and regulations are there but still many people who are below this age limit they consume it. Alcohol is also one of the habit-forming substances so when control is not there people land up in chronic alcoholism. Reasons for increase in consumption of alcohol is rapid industrialization, nuclear family, staying away from warm family environment, peer pressure, pressure of job and performing well in life, i.e. target setting is there, increase social gatherings and alcohol consumption is considered as symbol of modernization.",

      "title": "Resolutions, ambitions and action plans …",
      "abstract": "At the time of writing, it is January and the New Year is underway. It is a time that is typically rich in tradition across most cultures, where we reflect on what has past, and what is ahead. One tradition prevalent across Westernised cultures is that of the New Year's resolution: making a promise to address or change something in the coming year, to improve upon years gone past.1 In the UK, the most commonly made resolutions tend to centre on altering diets and lifestyle in order to improve health or lose weight.1, 2 Estimates suggest that the majority of people, however, break or give up on their New Year's resolution within 12 days.2 People who succeed in maintaining their resolutions beyond 12 days do so because of positive differences in: stimulus control (whether snacks are available to stare back at you when you open the cupboard); willpower (the effort available to expend on resisting an impulse); and reinforcement (positive reminders of the aims guiding the resolution).3 In health care, we often engage in strategies to promote behaviour change in our patients, colleagues and even ourselves. Change in health behaviour is notoriously challenging. It may be a source of stress and a drain on effort for both the person attempting to make the necessary change and those involved in supporting it. Behavioural psychologists suggest that there is a threshold point at which behaviours acquire an automaticity, and therefore cease to become effortful. It is at this point that the behaviour can be considered a habit, and research suggests that it can take anywhere up to 254 days to reach this tipping point.4 The beginning of 2019 has seen the publication of a set of resolutions for the health sphere too. In England, the long-term plan of the National Health Service (NHS England) lays out a set of ambitions for the next 10 years that propose to address divides, disparities and disruption in health for patients.5 Much of the rhetoric is welcome, and is considered common sense;6 however, there remain sceptics who point out that much of the 133-page document reflects non-specific high-level references that do little to outline what needs to be done in the ‘real world’ in order to achieve the laudable aims within the plan.7, 8 Will this too become another resolution that is abandoned in time? In one of last year's issues of The Clinical Teacher, Jo Hart and colleagues presented the findings of a project that looked at how medical students respond to feedback in communication skills teaching sessions.9 One key point is based on the principle that to optimally support the successful integration of feedback and promote positive behavioural change, learners need to develop action plans, and that these action plans need to be specific.10 In many resolutions, as some suggest with the NHS long-term plan, there is often a disconnect between higher-level abstract aims and specific action plans that translate into behavioural change; however, that is not to say we should eschew the ambitions that are outlined in such objectives. Indeed, these are often reflective of aims and values that are central to informing our subsequent actions and behaviours. So, in order to keep the guiding aims relatable to the proposed objectives, I recommend looking first to see how the two may complement each other, perhaps in an augmentation of the traditional ‘SMART’ framework. Originating in business management literature, the idea that conceptualising goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound has become a popular aid to developing objectives that are believed to be more likely to succeed.11 Ambition: keep, or return to, the original guiding aim and ambition (positive reinforcement) Learning: what key lessons or learning points can you take from prior attempts or experiences to help improve chances of success this time around? (willpower) Environment: what do you need in your environment to help you succeed? This may include timing and people, as well as other resources (stimulus control) Changes: what changes do you need to make to yourself (your approach to this kind of objective), and/or your environment – including the nature of your job and those around you (positive reinforcement and stimulus control) Aside from the common resolutions to improve health and fitness, medical educators may well strive to read more research, contribute more papers to the field, or institute changes to their teaching or environment with the aim of improving learners’ experiences. Keep in mind that our work is inherently complex and networked. Success is often dependent upon a number of factors outside of our control. I suggest having a guiding aim of making improvements to a particular educational activity or reading a paper or journal each month to keep up to date with developments in the field, as well as simultaneously being SMART about the factors that are within your direct influence, such as the time you set aside to dedicate to such activities. It is important to note that missing or slipping cues, such as missing a particular issue of The Clinical Teacher, does not have a detrimental impact on longer-term habit formation. It is a common myth from earlier psychological hypothesising that has led to a misbelief that missing single opportunities would cancel out all previous change efforts. Fortunately, this has been disproven. Therefore, small setbacks and slips should be interpreted as a cue to reinforce the aim, revisit the learning, review what environmental cues may or may not be helping and consider if any further changes may be necessary.

      "title": "Editorial: Vaping and Cardiovascular health � An opportunity or a risk?",
      "abstract": "The history of smoking dates back to the ancient times and mankind has been smoking different plant materials for the leisure and addiction. One of its kind, tobacco cigarette smoking was introduced in the 19th century and its use increased exponentially by the mid of 20th century. Initially it was thought that the tobacco cigarette smoking had some medicinal properties but as the rate of tobacco smoking increased, the adverse effects started appearing and by the end of 20th century it was a well-known fact that tobacco cigarette smoking was a health hazard and a major risk factor for the fatal diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases1. With the emergent side effects and health hazards tobacco cigarette smoking was discouraged on a larger scale in the society and the search for the alternative to it led to the creation of E-cigarettes in the early 21st century.&#x0D; Since the introduction of vaping i.e., use of E-cigarettes, E-hookahs, vape pens or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), it is taken as a safe alternative of tobacco cigarettes smoking and a way to help in smoking cessation2. The perception of less harmful tobacco smoking substitute, extensive marketing and a vogue of vaping have resulted in an explosive increase in the use of vaping devices among the former smokers, current smokers and even in never smoker adolescents and young adults in the past two decades. According to the National Health Interview Survey (NIHS), the number of E-cigarette users increased to 8.1 million in United States in 20183 and according to National Youth Tobacco Survey in US 19.6% of high school students and 4.7% of middle school students are regular users of E-cigarettes4.&#x0D; Most vaping devices are made up of four components, including: a cartridge or pod containing e-liquid, a metallic heating coil, a battery and a mouthpiece. The e-liquid contains chemicals like propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavoring substance and varying amount of nicotine. Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin act as solvent carriers. When a person puffs/inhales, it activates the heating coil that causes the e-liquid to vaporize that is inhaled by the person. The vapors or aerosols that are inhaled deliver certain chemicals into the body that are mainly:&#x0D; &#x0D; Nicotine&#x0D; Organic volatile compounds generated by heating of solvent carriers such as glycols, glycerin, toluene that cause irritation to the eyes, oral and laryngeal mucosa.&#x0D; Carbonyls such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, acrolein and glyoxal which are carcinogenic and cause extensive damage to the lungs.&#x0D; Chemical present in flavoring agents like Diacetyl, acetyl propionyl and acetoin cause severe asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans&#x0D; The contaminants that may be the tobacco derived alkaloids and nitrosamines&#x0D; Metal particles from the heating coils like chromium, cadmium, nickel, lead; and particles of copper, nickel, and silver&#x0D; &#x0D; These chemicals are responsible for the injuries to the respiratory mucosa, skin and are considered as carcinogens.&#x0D; The cardiovascular effects of vaping are mediated by:&#x0D; &#x0D; Nicotine, it has been demonstrated that activation of nicotinic Ach receptors causes release of catecholamines and promotes hemodynamic alterations, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arrhythmogenesis5.&#x0D; Increased oxidative stress that is produced due to aerosolized chemicals, metals, particulates and acrolein. It causes generation of oxygen derived free radical species causing inflammation and damage to the endothelial cells, reduced bioavailability of NO, plaque destabilization, platelet activation and thrombus formation causing myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular events5.&#x0D; &#x0D; Though tobacco cigarette smoking is 3 times more harmful than vaping6 the studies have shown that the vaping is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events as compared to non-users and the use of tobacco cigarette smoking along with vaping cause the highest number of cardiovascular events as compared to non-users, vaping or tobacco cigarette smoking alone7.&#x0D; The vaping epidemic and its potential hazards can be controlled by certain measures:&#x0D; &#x0D; Regulating the advertisements of e-cigarettes&#x0D; Reducing the access of adolescents and young adults to the vaping products&#x0D; Public awareness campaigns to educate children and adults about the harmful effects of vaping&#x0D; Reducing the second-hand exposure to vaping aerosols by precluding its use in the indoors and public spaces.&#x0D; &#x0D; The studies so far have not proved vaping to be an effective tool for smoking cessation, instead the user who start vaping for smoking cessation often end up using both and the use of vaping among adolescents increases the propensity of them to become tobacco cigarette smoker. In the author�s opinion the use of vaping should not be recommended, and its use should be discouraged owing to its adverse effects on health.",

      "title": "Review on carcinogens materials in chemical laboratories",
      "abstract": "The review recalls the types of carcinogenic chemicals that are used in laboratories, as well as the types of cigarettes and nicotine for smokers, which are considered essential substances for cancer. Smokers are more likely to develop lung cancer, although lung cancer can also affect people who have never smoked. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time you smoke and the number of cigarettes you smoke. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing lung cancer. Inhalation of carcinogenic lab materials or smoking causes lung cancer by damaging the cells lining the lungs. When you inhale cigarette smoke that is full of cancer-causing substances (carcinogens), changes in lung tissue begin almost immediately. At first, your body may be able to repair this damage. But with each repeated exposure, the normal cells that line your lungs are increasingly damaged. Over time, the damage causes cells to function abnormally and cancer may eventually develops. Many laboratories carry specific risks, including the risk of exposure to carcinogens, and preventing accidents in the laboratory requires high care and constant vigilance. Examples of risk factors include high voltages, pressures, high and low temperatures, corrosive and toxic chemicals, chemical fumes, radiation, fire and explosions, as well as biological hazards including infectious organisms and their toxins.",

      "title": "Adolescent caries: a discussion on diet and other factors, including soft drink consumption.",
      "abstract": "It can be summarized that adolescents have unique needs and concerns in regards to dental care. Among these concerns is the adolescent diet, which often contains high amounts of high-carbohydrate snack foods. Popular among these foods are carbonated beverages, usually containing significant amounts of sugar and caffeine. Sugar is a concern, as increased consumption of sugars has been identified as a potential factor in an increase in caries activity. Caffeine is a factor, as regular ingestion of caffeine has been shown to potentially lead to a physical desire to habitually ingest caffeine. Thus, there are increases in both the amount of sugars, as well as the amount of time that these sugars are present in the oral environment. Perhaps more significantly, the presence of caffeine in soft drinks makes it less likely that preventive counseling with an adolescent, related to the importance of a decrease in consumption, will be successful. In essence, teenagers like to drink \"pop,\" and they don't want to stop. Furthermore, because caffeine consumption is considered socially acceptable and is ingrained into daily habits, parents are likely to be regular consumers of coffee, carbonated beverages, or other caffeine-containing products. This makes preventive counseling on these matters more challenging. Dentists, dental hygienists, and related health professionals should be aware of the unique aspects of treating adolescents, and be willing and able to spend time on prevention and diet counseling. Preventive measures such as prescription-strength fluoride gels for home use, fluoride varnishes, and others may need additional emphasis on individuals exhibiting increased caries susceptibility.",

Despite having increased her daily intake of fibre and water, she is still only passing two stools a week. Her general practitioner excludes red flag features (box) and finds no abnormality on examination, apart from a loaded rectum. He suggests she try using laxatives to increase her stool frequency, but she is reluctant as she has heard they are not very effective and can have adverse effects.\n\n#### Red flag features in chronic constipation12\n\nLaxatives are foods or drugs that, when ingested, act directly on the gut (or gut contents) to increase stool frequency or ease stool passage. They differ from motility agents such as prucalopride, which exert a promotility effect after systemic absorption. Laxatives are used to treat chronic constipation, usually defined as the presence of difficult or infrequent passage of stool, often accompanied by straining or a sensation of incomplete evacuation, with symptoms present for more than three months.\n\nChronic constipation is common in the general population. A recent meta-analysis of population based observational studies reported a pooled prevalence of 14% worldwide, with a significantly higher prevalence in women and people of lower socioeconomic status.3 However, symptoms often fluctuate, and recent community data suggest that persistent symptoms over 10 to 20 years affect only 3% of the population.4 Population based studies also show that constipation affects quality of life, is associated with several comorbidities (including haemorrhoids and anal fissure),5 and may be associated with a modest reduction in survival.6\n\nLaxatives may act by several mechanisms, including bulking the stool volume, softening the stool consistency, increasing the stool volume …",

      "title": "Urinary symptoms in diabetes",
      "abstract": "Physicians have been studying urine for thousands of years. We still look at it but thankfully no longer have to taste it! Urinary symptoms may include changes in urine colour, clarity or frothiness; in volume (polyuria, anuria); frequency of urination; ease or otherwise of passing urine (for example retention); control of urination (for example incontinence); and sensations such as dysuria or awareness (or lack of it) of the need to urinate. All these aspects are relevant in diabetes. ‘My symptom started about 5 weeks ago… Constant thirst and needing to go to bathroom every hour. I am 60 and thought this was just another of the wonderful joys of aging. But as time went on I realized that my urine was smelling very sweet.’1 ‘I have high blood glucose… I'm urinating loads especially at night. I have terrible urge incontinence, I leak quite a bit… I'm only 40 so quite embarrassing.’2 Dry mouth, sweet or funny taste, thirst, need to urinate, not feeling right, and weakness are regarded as osmotic hyperglycaemic symptoms.3 Polyuria is the passage of large volumes of urine, usually at frequent intervals. It has been suggested that both the high volumes of urine and the high urine glucose content may cause long-term damage.4 Hyperglycaemia may not be the only reason for polyuria in people with diabetes. People with Wolfram's syndrome can have both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus,5 as can others without this syndrome.6 Hypercalcaemia and diabetes may co- exist. ‘The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in primary hyperparathyroidism is approximately 8% and that of primary hyperparathyroidism in diabetic patients is approximately 1%. Both values are about three-fold higher than the respective expected prevalences in general populations.’7 SGLT2 inhibitors induce glycosuria and hence both polyuria and increased urinary frequency. Other drugs, such as diuretics, also increase urine output. ‘So, I'm on my 4th urine infection in 4 months… I also think that this one *might* have spread to my kidneys, based on the fact that I have pain there, nausea, and my temperature is up and down.’8 Bacteriuria is more common among women with diabetes than in those without diabetes, so researchers incubated uroepithelial cells from each group with Escherichia coli. They found that ‘Type 1-fimbriated E. coli adhere more to diabetic than to control uroepithelial cells.’9 Cloudy urine, with or without symptoms, should be investigated, as should malodorous urine. Urinary infection can be present without these signs. Among people with diabetes, urinary infections may be due to, or be associated with, multi-resistant or unusual organisms including fungi. ‘Last week whilst at my diabetic clinic appointment I gave a urine sample and had my period at the time. Blood was present in my sample and doctor… asked if it was monthly period. Yesterday I get letter from clinic saying they have traced protein in my urine and want me back for second test… petrified that maybe I have start of kidney disease and am going to die before I get to 43!!!’10 Please don't send urine samples from menstruating patients for microalbumin or other protein analysis. Refer anyone aged ≥45 years with ‘unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection or visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection… using a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for bladder cancer.’11 People with diabetes may be slightly more at risk of bladder cancer than those without diabetes – a meta- analysis found an overall relative risk of 1.24, 95% CI 1.08–1.42 compared with people without diabetes.12 Various studies have suggested that pioglitazone use is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.13, 14 Other studies did not confirm a link.15 The UK's MHRA advises avoiding pioglitazone in patients with past or present bladder cancer, and in people at higher risk of this.16 The American FDA concludes: pioglitazone ‘may be linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer’. ‘Patients should contact their health care professionals if they experience any of the following signs or symptoms after starting pioglitazone, as these may be due to bladder cancer: blood or a red color in the urine; new or worsening urge to urinate; pain when urinating.’17 Kidney disease is very common among people with diabetes. The National Diabetes Audit found that 64.8% of people with type 1 diabetes and 79.1% of those with type 2 diabetes had some evidence of chronic kidney disease.18 Protein in the urine reduces the surface tension and, if present in large amounts, for example in nephrotic syndrome, can cause frothy or foamy urine.19 Diabetic cystopathy is a common complication of diabetes that gets little publicity. Symptoms are variable and many patients are asymptomatic or assume symptoms are just ‘because of the sugar’. Symptoms include hesitancy, poor stream, dribbling, nocturia, a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, reduced awareness of the need to urinate, leaking with increased abdominal pressure such as coughing, or more general urinary incontinence, infrequent urination, and urinary retention. Exclude other causes such as urinary tract infection or prostatic disease.20 A Japanese study found that 40% of people with diabetes without urinary symptoms had voiding problems on questioning. Cystometrograms showed high bladder volume at first desire to void and maximal capacity, with reduced detrusor contractility; and higher residual volume in people with diabetes compared with non-diabetic controls.21 In Taiwan, 22.5% of patients reported an overactive bladder on asking, among whom 48.0% had incontinence.22 Women with type 2 diabetes without other causes of urinary symptoms were more likely to have nocturia, and had weaker urinary streams, and voided smaller volumes than those without diabetes. Among women with diabetes, 13.9% had significant residual volume post voiding compared with 1.8% of controls. Reduced bladder emptying efficiency was associated with the presence of neuropathy.23 Although ‘diabetic cystopathy’ is usually understood to mean neuropathic bladder disease, the cause is likely to be multifactorial including nerve damage within the bladder and its exit, microvascular disease, and the effects of high glucose and microorganisms. Treatment depends on the problem, but reducing hyperglycaemia will reduce polyuria and reduce progression of neuropathy. Voiding every 2 hours can prevent excessive bladder volumes. Some patients with neurogenic bladder may need to learn how to exert lower abdominal pressure to help emptying. Others may need to self-catheterise or have an indwelling urethral catheter. Nowadays, most catheterised patients can use catheter valves, avoiding embarrassing, weighty leg bags, although most such patients use a night bag. NICE guidance on the management of urinary incontinence and other symptoms states that such patients should have specialist assessment.24-26 Urinary symptoms are common among people with diabetes who may not mention them unless asked. Don't assume that they are all due to hyperglycaemic polyuria. Many will not be. Any urinary symptoms are, at best, a nuisance or, at worst, a torment. Seek them. Treat them. Don't assume that all polyuria is due to glycosuria, especially in people who have near-normal glucose control. Do control hyperglycaemia as glycosuria will exacerbate urinary problems, in addition to the other hazards of hyperglycaemia. Treat urinary tract infections promptly having clarified the causative organism. Beware multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. Don't test urine for protein during menstruation but do take non-menstrual haematuria seriously. Refer via suspected cancer channels anyone aged ≥45 years with ‘unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection or visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection’.11 Remember diabetic cystopathy. ‘Evaluation of bladder function should be performed for individuals with diabetes who have recurrent urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, incontinence, or a palpable bladder. The medical history should include simple questions to unveil symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms.’27",

Smokeless tobacco (ST) use among Indiana youngsters is higher than its use among youngsters nationally. More than 10% of current Indiana high school junior and senior female students report some ST usage. ST ingestion causes addiction and serious health consequences, including various forms of cancer and significant dental diseases. It is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. Nicotine levels in ST are very high, and ST intake is rapidly addicting. Tobacco companies have been accused of \"graduating\" youthful customers from flavored lower-nicotine \"starter\" products to forms that contain a more highly concentrated nicotine content. Clinicians should routinely ask children, teens and adults about ST use. Early intervention in youth who are experimenting with ST or using \"starter\" products may prevent addiction and disease. Physicians should be alert to the intraoral physical signs of ST use. To strengthen their tobacco intervention skills, physicians should require continuing education training regarding ST.",

Tobakk, særlig aktiv røyking, representerer enformidabel risikoøkning for en rekke sykdommer, både alene og sammen med andre risikofaktorer ellersykdomsdisposisjoner.Det begynner etter hvert å gå opp for dem som driver tobakksforebyggende arbeid, og for befolkningenellers, at tobakk ikke bare inneholder helseskadelige stoffer, men også er sterkt avhengighetsskapende. Disseto effektene er knyttet til forskjellige stoffer i tobakken, og de opptrer med stor avstand i tid. Som pedagogiskvirkemiddel gjør kunnskapen om nikotinets raskt inntredende avhengighetsskapende effekt kanskje størreinntrykk enn de helseskadelige effektene som inntrer flere tiår senere. Økt kunnskap om nikotinets avhengighetsskapendeeffekt kan bli den viktigste motivasjonsfaktor for å forhindre at ungdom begynner med tobakkog kan få foreldregenerasjonen til å ta større ansvar for den sosiale arv den bringer videre.Som et foreløpig siste kapittel i røykeepidemiens historie, har vi nå også fått erstatningssaker mot tobakksindustrienhit til landet.

      "abstract": "Among the different behavioral criteria used to discriminate substance dependence (or drug addiction) from other non-disordered forms of drug use, drug intake escalation presents a number of unique features that makes it particularly suitable for modeling in nonhuman animals. This criterion has stood the passage of time despite major revisions of diagnostic systems, it is common to all known drugs of abuse and it can be readily and unambiguously operationalized in laboratory animals. Here I exhaustively review evidence showing that escalation to heavy consumption of different drugs (except perhaps nicotine) can be rapidly induced in the majority of individual animals (i.e., rats) by increased drug availability. Such an escalation of drug use is probably paralleled by an authentic escalation to drug addiction, as it is associated with the co-occurrence of other addiction-like changes (i.e., increased motivation for drug use; increased difficulty to abstain from drug use; decreased sensitivity to negative consequences). In addition, during escalation of drug intake, most individual animals become increasingly responsive to drug- and stress-primed, but apparently not cue-primed, reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction. Finally, following increased drug use, most individuals present selective cognitive dysfunctions (e.g., deficits in executive functions) that may contribute to the establishment and/or persistence of addiction. Thus, the study of individuals with escalating patterns of drug use should provide a unique and valid approach to investigate, experimentally, the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the progression to addiction.",

Hangovers are rough. And the more you drink the night before, the more severe your hangover symptoms might feel the morning after. Most of the time you just need to drink water, eat some food, and walk it off. But if you’ve had too much to drink, you may be harming your body and need to see your doctor for treatment. Let’s look at how to tell the difference between a mild, temporary hangover that you can treat at home and one that may need some extra medical attention. Each of these 10 common symptoms stems from a physiological response to the presence of alcohol in your digestive and urinary systems, especially your stomach, kidneys, and bloodstream.",

      "abstract": "Chocolate has specific orosensory qualities that provide strong hedonic effects, which in turn relate to changes in the opioidergic and dopaminergic systems. This may induce soothing effects, which are especially relevant to people with certain types of mood depression (e.g., atypical depression).\r\n\r\n\r\nChocolate consumption may be a personality marker of high neuroticism and represent a strategy to cope with the propensity to experience intense negative emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the psychoactive substances present in chocolate, at least methylxanthines (theobromine and caffeine) have significant psychopharmacological effects. Methylxanthines have an impact on mood and improve performance in specific tasks. Methylxanthines may therefore play the role of chocolate as an “energizer.”\r\n\r\n\r\nChocolate addiction should be regarded as an inaccurate and misleading term. “Moreishness” may be a better term. It translates as the ambivalence associated with the desire to eat more chocolate (due to high palatability) and self-imposed dietary restraint (due to personal and cultural beliefs), which limits chocolate intake before satiation is attained, making the “desire for chocolate” more salient (craving).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orosensory qualities of chocolate are uncontested determinants for chocolate liking, but ­methylxanthines also contribute to an acquired taste for chocolate liking.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEA and anandamide are unlikely to exert significant biological effects. Also, an increase in brain serotonin related to carbohydrates after chocolate consumption is unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnandamide-related compounds, salsolinol, THBCs, and magnesium cannot be discarded as ­effective psychoactive agents (see Table 31.1).",

      "abstract": "Position Statement: The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) bases the following position stand on a critical analysis of the literature on the safety and efficacy of the use of energy drinks (ED) or energy shots (ES). The ISSN has concluded the following. 1. Although ED and ES contain a number of nutrients that are purported to affect mental and/or physical performance, the primary ergogenic nutrients in most ED and ES appear to be carbohydrate and/or caffeine. 2. The ergogenic value of caffeine on mental and physical performance has been well-established but the potential additive benefits of other nutrients contained in ED and ES remains to be determined. 3. Consuming ED 10-60 minutes before exercise can improve mental focus, alertness, anaerobic performance, and/or endurance performance. 4. Many ED and ES contain numerous ingredients; these products in particular merit further study to demonstrate their safety and potential effects on physical and mental performance. 5. There is some limited evidence that consumption of low-calorie ED during training and/or weight loss trials may provide ergogenic benefit and/or promote a small amount of additional fat loss. However, ingestion of higher calorie ED may promote weight gain if the energy intake from consumption of ED is not carefully considered as part of the total daily energy intake. 6. Athletes should consider the impact of ingesting high glycemic load carbohydrates on metabolic health, blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as the effects of caffeine and other stimulants on motor skill performance. 7. Children and adolescents should only consider use of ED or ES with parental approval after consideration of the amount of carbohydrate, caffeine, and other nutrients contained in the ED or ES and a thorough understanding of the potential side effects. 8. Indiscriminant use of ED or ES, especially if more than one serving per day is consumed, may lead to adverse events and harmful side effects. 9. Diabetics and individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatorenal, and neurologic disease who are taking medications that may be affected by high glycemic load foods, caffeine, and/or other stimulants should avoid use of ED and/or ES unless approved by their physician.",

This has been associated with a dramatic increase in alcohol‐related harm, involving premature death, chronic health problems and social ills. These adverse outcomes are not inevitable. They could be avoided by rational policy‐making that followed the scientific evidence. Efforts to directly influence drinking culture and to encourage ‘responsible drinking’ have failed. Sharply increasing the price and restricting the availability of alcohol would be likely to have major benefits for the well being of the UK population.",

Clinicians and researchers alike have the need to quantify drinking patterns to determine the risk for adverse, health-related events such as injury, liver damage, and cancer. Biochemical measures of ethanol consumption are affected by temporal patterns of drinking as well as individual characteristics such as gender and age. The choice of a laboratory analysis to determine ethanol consumption is complex; no single laboratory test will predict drinking accurately across all drinking patterns, across the life span, and across gender. In conjunction with interviews and physical assessment, however, biochemical laboratory tests are sensitive tools used to measure both recent and long-term patterns of alcohol consumption.",

Las conclusiones a la vista de los resultados son las siguientes: 1.- las cifras obtenidas en el seguimiento anual, sobre el abandono del tabaquismo, son algo inferiores a las publicadas por los autores mas representativos. 2.- el grado mayor de dependencia, incide negativamente en el exito del abandono del tabaquismo al ano, mientras que los intentos previos de cesacion constituyen un factor predictor del exito. El uso inapropiado del chicle por parte de nuestros pacientes no permite descartar la eficacia de esta modalidad terapeutica. 3.- el incremento ponderal no ha influido de forma significativa en la recaida. 4.- la realizacion concomitante de ejercicio fisico, durante la terapia, el cumplimiento de la asistencia y el cambio en los habitos de vida, son variables que predisponen al abandono del tabaquismo. 5.- la gratuidad del metodo, y la carencia de infraestructura administrativa creemos inciden negativamente en los resultados. 6.- el hecho de que en nuestra sociedad se tome como habitual lo excepcional en otras, asistencia a bares y restaurantes, consumo diario de alcohol incide en que cualquier actitud que requiera disciplina sea con frecuencia obstaculizada desde colectivos que adoptan la relajacion como estilo de vida.",

Pilots who are required to abstain before and during flight may suffer cockpit performance decrements. This study reviews the physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and psychological effects of smoking withdrawal as they relate to flying performance. The variety of research designs, methodologies, and subject groups is discussed. Findings suggest that heart rate, arousal, vasoconstriction, vigilance, concentration, and energy increase with nicotine use; stress and irritability are reduced with smoking. Withdrawal, on the other hand, produces a decrease in carboxyhemoglobin, digit recall, serial addition/subtraction, and job satisfaction; blood pressure, depression, absenteeism, caloric intake, craving, aggressiveness, confusion, and impulsivity increase with withdrawal. Severity of withdrawal symptoms varied, but most studies report psychological, and/or physiological responses to nicotine withdrawal. The conflict between health and performance is discussed and suggestions for future directions are offered.",

Because these products are seen as a part of the cultural heritage, there is little enthusiasm for their regulation throughout South and South-East Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc. Nearly 80% of users live in these areas, which could negatively impact their social, physical, and emotional health. According to several studies, quitting smoking may make people crave smokeless tobacco even more. However, they began using smokeless tobacco as a recreational activity but ultimately developed physical health conditions like gastritis, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, mouth cancer, and carcinoma of the liver. Additionally, they had medical and mental illnesses like melancholy, addiction, stress, mental anguish, and even suicidal thoughts, among others. Since it is harmful, smokeless tobacco should be handled with care. Unfortunately, our policy has not been upgraded or even had the legislation and regulation system applied. In order to alleviate this susceptible problem for the betterment of the country, it is now vital to take emergency steps to concentrate on &amp; conduct preventive comprehensive action at every level from the government &amp; local concern authorities.",

Assim o presente artigo tem o objetivo de evidenciar o uso do cigarro eletrônico e causas potenciais a saúde, identificando os danos causados pelo cigarro eletrônico ao usuário e consequentemente seu impacto na saúde pública. Trata-se o de um estudo de revisão narrativa da literatura, com abordagem qualitativa. O uso dos dispositivos eletrônicos torna-se um possível perpetuador do ato de fumar podendo representar iniciação e até mesmo a permanência no tabagismo. Já existem prejuízos relacionados ao uso dos cigarros eletrônicos (CE), eles provocam toxidade para o organismo, também pode causar dependência e provocar doenças nos sistemas pulmonar, cardiovascular e gastrointestinal, causando desequilíbrio no corpo humano, o uso do CE também está relacionado a problemas na saúde mental como, irritação. Fica claro que o uso do cigarro eletrônico promove prejuízos tanto para o usuário quando para a saúde pública, sendo necessário cada vez mais normas que fiscalizem a disseminação de propagandas e comercialização do produto. Assim sugere-se que novas pesquisas sejam realizadas afim que corroborar evidências dos malefícios do uso do CE, afim de entender seus diferentes aspectos e traçar estratégias para a diminuição de seus efeitos, visando a melhoria da saúde de toda a comunidade.",

Nicotine is the main cause of smoking addiction, and the custom of preparation for smoking itself and smell of cigarettes create addictive behavior among smokers. Today, nicotine is socially most widely accepted legal drug in the world, and its uptake into the organism through the respiratory tract is 10 times stronger than heroin. Addiction and necessity for cigarettes are constant and intense, and the treatment for smoking addicts is long and difficult. Smoking is a worldwide epidemic, which is closely connected to other addictions such as coffee, alcohol, drugs, and gambling.",

      "abstract": "The authors describe the experience of quitting smoking, focusing on the obstacles youth struggle with, based on individual interviews and focus groups with 54 teenagers in New York City. A major obstacle was the belief that people should stop smoking forever. The youth had to cope with temptation, frequent and often intense urges or cravings for cigarettes, and lack of social support from their family and friends. The young participants not only had to cope with general life stresses without being able to use cigarettes to reduce tensions but also had to contend with new stressful situations, such as friends who put them down for not smoking. In addition, the teens had to give up things that were important to them, such as friendships, during their quit attempts. The study describes how quitting can be a much more stressful experience for youth than research typically acknowledges. The authors discuss public health implications.",

These stereotypes are most commonly rooted in historical racism, attitudes to poverty and the fear that these issues bring when associated with inaccurate and sensationalist reporting by the media. Crack cocaine is a different drug when compared to opiates and services need to acknowledge that national policies and practice have predominately reflected the needs of opiate users leading to imbalances in provision within generic treatment providers. The 'high' experienced by a person taking crack or cocaine is produced by a chemical called dopamine. The combination of increased adrenaline levels and low dopamine levels after a period of using can produce the feelings of being 'wired' or 'prang'. Crack cocaine use can be associated with high levels of health complaints, drug related deaths and also an increase in criminal involvement.",

Over a course of time, in long term smokers the physiological effects of the smoking these plant parts brings out gradual changes in the individual body parts and organ systems which eventually result in developing some cumulative changes in the body in regular functioning. These effects are widely varied under influence of various external factors ranging from geographical conditions, food habits, socio-economic and legal conditions of the environment the person living in. In this review we highlight the specific effects of smoking tobacco and cannabis on the physiology of human body. Various studies on the effects of tobacco and cannabis have revealed the detailed analysis and statistics of the micro level changes in the morphology and physiology of different systems of the body. These studies on the smokers of different plant material also revealed the details",

      "abstract": "The abuse of cannabis and its consequences to mental health have been a subject of much debate in recent years. While the literature is replete with reports of mental disturbances following acute intoxications (1, 4, 7, 15), the mental health implications of long-term abuse of cannabis remain speculative (9, 13). Since the drug possesses psychotomimetic and hallucinogenic (8) properties, prolonged experimentation with cannabis on human subjects is undesirable. The clinical manifestations of disturbed mental functioning due to chronic abuse of cannabis can therefore be best observed in societies where the drug is taken as a pastime, generally to enjoy pleasant euphoria. Such a situation is found in India where the use of cannabis has become woven into the general philosophy of life over the years. The drug is particularly used at religious ceremonies, and sweets and non-alcoholic beverages containing varying quantities of cannabis are traditionally offered and consumed during the colour-throwing festival of Holi.",

      "title": "Vaccines against nicotine",
      "abstract": "AbstractMedications against any dependence-inducing drug face a dilemma: if they are efficient, they will induce withdrawal symptoms and the patient is likely to stop taking his medication. Anti drug vaccines are irreversible, provide protection over years and need booster injections far beyond the critical phase of acute withdrawal symptoms. Interacting rather with the drug in the blood than with a receptor in the brain, the vaccines are in addition free of side effects due to central interaction. For drugs like nicotine interacting with different types of receptors in many organs, this is a further advantage. There are three reasons, that anti drug vaccines have first been developed against nicotine. Firstly, in most parts of the world 20- to 50% of the adult population smoke and any smoking cessation treatment will have an important impact on public health and be commercially a very attractive product. The second reason are the smokers themselves, which would like to quit in significant numbers and which have shown good compliance for any form of treatment. Thirdly, the quantities of cocaine or heroine taken by dependant persons are higher than the quantity of nicotine per cigarette, which makes an anti nicotine vaccine the easier vaccine project.Three anti nicotine vaccines are today in an advanced stage of clinical evaluation. We report here how those vaccines work, on the progress of the trials and future developments to expect. Results show that the efficiency of the vaccines is directly related to the antibody levels of the probates, a fact which will help to optimize further the vaccine effect. We expect the vaccines to appear on the market during a time window between 2009 and 2011.",

The responsibilities of the party-giver to avoid over-drinking by guests or driving while intoxicated by leaving guests are noted. The responsibilities of the guests at the party are also noted. Different persons react to alcohol differently. It is important to be aware of one's own level of tolerance and not overstep it. It is important that the host of the party provides plenty of food--it helps counteract the effects of alcohol as well as provides an alternative to drinks. It is important to watch guests to see that they do not consume too much alcohol. This could be done by having a bartender. If a guest is not in a fit state to drive, keep him engaged in conversation until he is sober or provide him with a place to sleep. If the drunk guest insists on driving, take his car keys from him or arrange for someone else to drive him home.",

No es ajeno el contexto de rebeldia pero no de marginacion en que se desarrolla su consumo y que muchas personas que Io han tomado Io han dejado o ha pasado a ser aislado. Se considera, por tanto, algo pasajero, accidental, sin consecuencias y propio de una determinada fase de Ia vida o de algun momento episodico. Se ha planteado asimismo el papel dei cannabis en el tratamiento de algunas enfermedades o para minimizar los efectos indeseables de algunos tratamientos. Todo ello lleva a la necesidad de informacion sobre Ia sustancia y su entorno. Sus indicaciones, interacciones y efectos indeseables. No es facil, sin embargo Io que podria ser Ia elaboracion de un prospecto de utilizacion. Entre otros motivos porque falia la premisa de condiciones higienicas de fabricacion, manipulacion control de contaminantes y la notificacion de los problemas del consumo. El cannabis habitualmente se fuma. Sus efectos dependen de la amplitud y numero de caladas y de Ia concentracion de delta-9-tetrahidrocannabinol o THC en el cigarro. El efecto maximo se alcanza entre los tres y diez minutos y persiste de forma decreciente hasta Ias dos o tres horas. Por via oral, en forma de aceites, pasteles o infusiones, Ia absorcion es lenta e irregular. Es inactivado por los acidos dei estomago y su transformacion por el higado. El inicio de los efectos tiene lugar entre media hora y dos horas despues dei consumo y persiste unas seis horas. Se considera que Ia via oral es dos o tres veces menos potente que Ia via pulmonar. Tras el consumo de un cigarrillo puede detectarse productos de degradacion de Ia sustancia en orina durante una semana. En consumidores habitudes pueden detectarse en orina mas alla de un mes despues del ultimo consumo. El cannabis produce euforia o placer a traves de la dopamina y los opioides endogenos: bienestar, relajacion, risa facil, locuacidad, pero tambien ansiedad y pânico. Altera Ia memoria a corto plazo y la concentracion. Ocasiona enrojecimiento de Ias conjuntivas, reduccion de Ia presion intraocular, sequedad de boca. Por su efecto mitigador de vomitos se ha considerado de utilidad para hacer frente a nauseas debidos ai tratamiento medico de algunos tipos de câncer. Reduce el dolor, provoca somnolencia y puede dificultar Ia conduccion de automoviles. Incrementa Ia actividad motora, pero puede dar falta de coordinacion, dificultad en la articulacion de la palabra, temblores, debilidad y espasmos musculares. Aumenta el apetito, Ia frecuencia cardiaca, Ia presion arterial, Ia sensibilidad termica y la percepcion visual, auditiva y tactil. Da lugar a alteraciones en el espacio y tiempo y alucinaciones visuales y auditivas. Puede ocasionar alteraciones de Ia inmunidad, disminucion de Ias hormonas sexuales, aumento de la prolactina con secrecion de leche a traves de los pezones. Aumenta los riesgos obstetricos y de tumor de testiculo. Los recien nacidos de madres consumidoras de cannabis pueden tener bajo peso. La sustancia activa, el THC, atraviesa la barrera placentaria y llega hasta el feto. Tambien se acumula en la leche materna, en cantidades ocho veces superiores a su deposito en sangre.",

Dieters were more likely to have started, and to have continued smoking in order to control their weight, and among current smokers, dieters reported having had shorter quit attempts.The dieters/former smokers' comparatively high weight gain after smoking cessation is discussed in terms of possible changes in dietary intake, metabolic rate, and physical activity.",

Frauen trinken gewohnlich weniger riskant als Manner, dennoch konsumieren 14% der Frauen Alkohol wahrend ihrer Schwangerschaft. Dies erhoht das Risiko fur Alkoholfolgeschaden beim Kind. Mehr als zwei Millionen Kinder und Jugendliche leben in Familien mit alkoholbezogenen Problemen und haben deshalb eine erhohte Wahrscheinlichkeit, intellektuelle, emotionale oder soziale Probleme oder eine Alkoholabhangigkeit zu entwickeln. Kinder alkoholabhangiger Eltern ubernehmen haufig spezifische Rollenmuster um dadurch die Herausforderungen ihres taglichen Lebens bewaltigen zu konnen.\r\nEin Sechstel aller deutschen Jugendlichen zwischen 12 und 17 Jahren konsumiert mindestens einmal wochentlich Alkohol. Sie bevorzugen Bier oder Mischgetranke und trinken meist gemeinsam mit ihren Freunden auf offentlichen Platzen. Jugendliche trinken aufgrund von Verstarkungs-, Bewaltigungs-, Konformitats- und sozialen Motiven. Riskantes Konsumverhalten (z.B. Rauschtrinken) hat zahlreiche kurz- und langfristige Effekte auf das korperliche, psychische und soziale Wohlbefinden von Jugendlichen.

The stereotypical image of a down-and-out heroin addict desperate for a fix can obscure the less familiar figure of the 40-something mum who secretly pops painkillers, watching the clock until it’s time for her next dose.\r\n\r\n‘Respectable addiction’ is not an emerging societal problem, as some might believe; it has been prevalent for many years. International research spanning well over a decade has suggested that a surprisingly high number of people are knowingly or otherwise abusing over the counter (OTC) medications, and there is widespread awareness of this problem among both the general public and the professionals – doctors and pharmacists – alike.\r\n\r\nNon-prescription analgesics containing codeine – a short-acting opium-based drug that belongs to the same family as heroin and morphine – are the most commonly identified OTC medicines being abused in Ireland, but problems have also been linked to products containing dextromethorphan (cough suppressant), pseudoephedrine (decongestant) and laxatives.\r\n\r\nAlthough the true extent of OTC misuse/abuse and addiction in Ireland is unclear, all indications are that it is relatively widespread and increasing. In a 2007 survey of over 100 pharmacists in Ireland, the vast majority (94%) believed that some customers, estimated at an average of four per day, who purchased products containing codeine, were addicted to codeine.\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Drug Treatment Reporting System, maintained by the Health Research Board, the numbers entering treatment for codeine as a problem drug have increased considerably in recent years, from 40 in 1998 to 180 in 2009. In addition, between 1998 and 2007, codeine, either alone or in conjunction with another drug, was implicated in the cause of 90 fatal poisonings.....",

      "abstract": "Der vorliegende Abschnitt behandelt die Frage, unter welchen Umstaenden der Alkoholkonsument zum Taeter wird. Die beim Delikt im Verkehr festgestellten Durchschnittswerte von Blutalkoholkonzentrationen (BAK) sind so hoch, dass die Mehrheit der Bevoelkerung gar nicht faehig ist, diese bei Trinkversuchen zu erreichen. Das Verkehrsrisiko im Verkehr wird hauptsaechlich von der Gruppe der starken Trinker und der Gruppe der gelegentlichen Rauschtrinker mit erheblicher Alkoholgewoehnung verursacht. Es muessen verschiedene Gruppen von Alkoholkonsumenten und daraus abgeleitet von alkoholisierten Verkehrsteilnehmern unterschieden werden: 1. Genuss- oder Konsumtrinker mit risikoarmem durchschnittlichem Alkoholkonsum, die auch die Gefahren der Verkehrsteilnahme unter Alkoholeinfluss unterschaetzen. 2. An Alkohol Gewoehnte beziehungsweise Risiko- oder Schwellentrinker mit riskantem bis starkem Alkoholkonsum, die aufgrund der entwickelten hohen Alkoholtoleranz die koerperlichen Gefahrensignale fuer eine bestehende Trunkenheit nicht mehr zuverlaessig wahrnehmen. 3. Harte Trinker und Alkoholabhaengige, die laengst alle Verhaltensziele der Sucht untergeordnet haben und regelmaessig Alkoholfahrten in Kauf nehmen. Am haeufigsten sind Verkehrsmediziner in der Begutachtungsstelle fuer Fahreignung mit der Gruppe der Risiko- oder Schwellentrinker konfrontiert. Auf sie trifft meist die Definition des Alkoholmissbrauchs zu. Bei BAK-Werten von ueber 1,09 Promille ist in allen Faellen - unabhaengig von der persoenlichen Konstitutionen, Befindlichkeit und Alkoholvertraeglichkeit - eine Beeintraechtigung der Fahrsicherheit gegeben. Die Alkoholabhaengigen sind auch ohne Auffaelligkeit im Strassenverkehr nach Anlage 4 zur Fahrerlaubnis-Verordnung (FeV) zum Fuehren eines Kfz nicht geeignet. Signifikante neuropsychologische Defizite Alkoholkranker sind auch bei Abstinenz nicht schnell reversibel, so dass bei chronischem Alkoholmissbrauch eine Ueberpruefung des Leistungsvermoegens vor Wiedererteilung einer Fahrerlaubnis angezeigt erscheint. Die Voraussetzungen, unter denen eine Fahreignung wieder angenommen werden kann, sind im Kommentar zu den Begutachtungs-Leitlinien sowie in den Beurteilungskriterien ausfuehrlich beschrieben. Dabei sind sowohl psychologische als auch medizinische Befunde zu beachten und haeufig interdisziplinaer zu interpretieren. Die Verkehrsmedizin hat dabei zu beantworten, wie der Alkoholkonsum in der Vorgeschichte diagnostisch einzuordnen ist und welcher Behandlungsbedarf daraus abzuleiten ist, ob ein chronischer Alkoholmissbrauch zu koerperlichen und/oder geistigen Folgeschaeden gefuehrt hat und ob aktuelle Befunde vorliegen, die mit der Behauptung einer gegebenenfalls erfolgten Distanzierung vom Alkoholkonsum nicht kompatibel sind.

Social tolerance to alcohol use is quite high and so far alcohol has not been taken seriously either by the Government or by any social organization. Production, sale, and consumption of alcohol is ever on the increase and it could be taken as the number one problem drug in the country. Cannabis and opium use has been in Nepal for centuries and in the past they did not pose much of a problem. Drug use began to be seen as a problem since only the mid‐1960s and early‐1970s with the influx of large numbers of hippies. Presently, the drug scene in Nepal is dominated by heroin and it has affected youths, mainly in the urban areas. A number of measures, both on supply reduction and demand reduction, have been taken by the Government together with non‐Governmental organizations. However, the number of drug users is on the increase. Relapse rate following detoxification treatment is quite high. After‐care and rehabilitative measures are lacking. Many drug users become involved in high‐risk behaviours in spite of their knowledge of the dangers. Therefore, it calls for the change in our strategies which must be based on the thorough understanding of human nature and its behaviour.",

Teenagers who work are more likely to drink than their unemployed peers, possibly offsetting the expected advantages of gaining early job experience. For young people in general, early heavy drinking can curtail continuing education and stifle opportunities for career advancement. At the opposite end of the age spectrum, some retirees may turn to alcohol to fill leisure time and cope with the stresses associated with retirement as a major life change. Other retirees, however, may cut back on drinking once they are freed from job-related stress, leave a work environment that encourages alcohol use, or experience financial constraints. Although tolerance to alcohol's effects wanes with advancing age, older adults who remain employed are more apt than retirees to drink heavily. Alternatively, older workers may decide to restrict their drinking to keep pace with younger colleagues.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cigarette smoking in the adolescent population remains a public health concern. A significant portion of the adolescent population currently uses tobacco. Nicotine is particularly addicting in adolescents, and quitting is difficult. The goals for adolescent cigarette smoking efforts must include both primary prevention and smoking cessation. Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies—including nicotine patches, gum, and nasal spray—have been studied to a limited extent in the adolescent population. Varenicline has not been evaluated as a treatment modality in adolescents. Long-term quit rates in the pharmacotherapy trials have not been optimal; however, decreases in cigarettes smoked per day have been observed. Several evidencebased guidelines include recommendations for smoking cessation in adolescents that include counseling and pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy may be instituted for some adolescents in addition to counseling and behavioral interventions. Therapy should be individualized, based on smoking patterns, patient preferences, and concomitant disease states. Smoking cessation support for parents should be instituted as well. The pharmacist can play a large role in helping the adolescent quit smoking. Further studies evaluating pharmacotherapy options for smoking cessation in adolescents are necessary. If pharmacotherapy is used, it should be individualized and combined with psychosocial and behavioral interventions.",

A pilot or surgeon might consume an amount of alcohol that might be appropriate at a dinner party, yet dangerous before a flight or an operation. Likewise, the same applies to individuals taking certain medications, or persons with certain brain conditions or who are at an age that may cause impairment by amounts that would be benign for others. These and other complexities have contributed to the development of special training and specialty status in the field. Interested persons can contact the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Association of Psychiatrists in Alcoholism and the Addictions.

For most of this century it has been described in terms of an abstinence syndrome (dependence and withdrawal) and associated with heroin use. In the 1980s, however, cocaine replaced heroin as the prototypical drug of abuse. Cocaine had heretofore not been considered to produce “physical dependence.” Nonetheless, for both cocaine and heroin, current models of addiction — models widely propagated by the media —reduce drug use patterns to the properties of drugs and biological characteristics of the user. In creating this model, scientific and clinical debates along with public debates rely on the supposedly typical, inevitably addicting results of repeated cocaine consumption. Yet naturalistic human drug use and drug taking by animals in the laboratory instead reinforce the picture that use of all drugs depends on the user's environment-Indeed, even the most severe examples of compulsive drug use can be reversed when key elements in the setting are modified. Such findings should by now play a fundamental role in both scientific and public conceptions of addiction, but they do not.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine, nicotine, ethanol and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are among the most prevalent and culturally accepted drugs in western society. For example, in Europe and North America up to 90% of the adult population drinks coffee daily and, although less prevalent, the other drugs are also used extensively by the population. Smoked tobacco, excessive alcohol consumption and marijuana (cannabis) smoking are addictive and exhibit adverse health effects. These drugs are not only common in the general population, but have also made their way into elite sports because of their purported performance-altering potential. Only one of the drugs (i.e., caffeine) has enough scientific evidence indicating an ergogenic effect. There is some preliminary evidence for nicotine as an ergogenic aid, but further study is required; cannabis and alcohol can exhibit ergogenic potential under specific circumstances but are in general believed to be ergolytic for sports performance. These drugs are currently (THC, ethanol) or have been (caffeine) on the prohibited list of the World Anti-Doping Agency or are being monitored (nicotine) due to their potential ergogenic or ergolytic effects. The aim of this brief review is to evaluate the effects of caffeine, nicotine, ethanol and THC by: 1) examining evidence supporting the ergogenic or ergolytic effects; 2) providing an overview of the mechanism(s) of action and physiological effects; and 3) where appropriate, reviewing their impact as performance-altering aids used in recreational and elite sports.",

      "title": "Food Addiction",
      "abstract": "The evidence for food's addictive properties is steadily growing. In addition to clinical and evolutionary plausibility, the possibility of addiction to food is supported by animal model research and increasingly by research with humans. Much as classic drugs of abuse \"hijack\" the brain, accumulating evidence with food suggests a similar impact, but with weaker effects. Although neurobiological evidence for food addiction is compelling, dependence as conceptualized with respect to alcohol and other drugs of abuse is fundamentally a behavioral disorder. Thus, we review the current state of food addiction research in the context of each of the diagnostic criterion for dependence (ie, tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control) and briefly explore other relevant addiction topics such as expectancies, reinforcement, and incentive salience. There is substantial evidence that some people lose control over their food consumption, suffer from repeated failed attempts to reduce their intake, and are unable to abstain from certain types of food or reduce consumption in the face of negative consequences. Although there is some evidence for other dependence criterion, further research is needed to examine tolerance and withdrawal to high-fat sweets, time spent in obtaining, using, and recovering from excess food consumption and the degree to which important activities are given up due to overconsumption. As science continues forward and both the public and elected leaders become aware that food may trigger an addictive process, this information will likely be used to inform policy. Thus, researchers need to carefully consider the implications of their work and the way in which the results may be interpreted.",

      "title": "Adicción a cocaína Estudio del receptor dopaminérgico D3 (D3R) como posible diana farmacológica en la prevención de las recaídas en su consumo",
      "abstract": "espanolLa adiccion a sustancias de abuso constituye un grave problema de salud publica a nivel global. Entre ellas, la cocaina sigue siendo la droga estimulante ilegal mas utilizada en Europa, con la mayor prevalencia en los paises del sur y oeste, como es el caso de Espana. La adiccion puede definirse como un trastorno mental cronico y recurrente caracterizado por la busqueda compulsiva de la droga. Durante largos periodos de abstinencia existe un alto riesgo de recaida en el consumo, por lo tanto, su prevencion se ha convertido en un objeto de estudio para el manejo de la adiccion debido a la falta de terapias efectivas para evitarlas. La importancia de estudiar las recaidas es porque pueden ser desencadenadas tanto por estimulos estresantes como por la reexposicion a la droga en si. Estos mismos desencadenantes se utilizan para restablecer los comportamientos asociados a las drogas en modelos animales. El paradigma pavloviano de preferencia de lugar condicionada inducida por drogas (CPP) se utiliza para evaluar las propiedades gratificantes de las drogas de abuso. Como consecuencia, los objetivos de este trabajo han sido: - Evaluar la posible implicacion del receptor dopaminergico D3 (D3R) en la recaida en el consumo de cocaina, ya que la evidencia acumulada indica que los antagonistas de estos receptores parecen ser muy prometedores para atenuar la recompensa y la recaida de la cocaina en modelos preclinicos de adiccion. - Estudiar si D3R esta involucrado en el aumento de los niveles plasmaticos de corticosterona durante la recaida en la CPP. - Estudiar las modificaciones en la expresion de DAT y D3R en el nucleo NAc (shell) durante la recaida en el CPP causada por el estres y por un priming de cocaina en ratones condicionados a la cocaina; Ademas, estudiamos si el bloqueo de D3R impide las modificaciones de esas expresiones. - Investigar los cambios en la cascada de mTOR en BLA y DG en la recaida en la CPP inducida por un priming de cocaina y estres social. La metodologia desarrollada se ha dividido en dos fases, primero se realizo un estudio de comportamiento utilizando la CPP, y luego un estudio molecular procesando las muestras obtenidas (cerebro y plasma) para interpretar los cambios que ocurrieron en la primera fase. Los diferentes grupos experimentales de ratones machos de la cepa C57BL/6 se condicionaron con cocaina a una dosis de 25 mg/kg durante cuatro dias. Al quinto dia, se realizo una prueba de condicionamiento posterior (Post-C) y luego, durante 7-8 semanas, se extinguio la CPP (ext). Una vez que el comportamiento adictivo habia cesado, se estudio la posible participacion de D3R en la restauracion de la CPP inducida por cocaina. Para eso, treinta minutos antes de la administracion de una dosis de priming de cocaina o un solo episodio de estres [social defeat (SD), inmovilizacion o dolor], administramos una dosis unica del antagonista selectivo de D3R, SB-277011-A. Las dosis administradas en cada grupo fueron a) 24 o 48 mg/kg, i.p. para el grupo de priming de cocaina, estres de inmovilizacion y estres por dolor; b) 12 o 24 mg/kg, i.p. para el grupo de estres SD. Los animales de control recibieron una inyeccion de vehiculo (agua desionizada, 1 ml/kg, i.p.). Ademas, los niveles plasmaticos de corticosterona (como marcador de estres) se cuantificaron por radioinmunoensayo (RIA) despues de una recaida. Los resultados mostraron que el bloqueo de D3R con SB-277011-A no antagonizo la recaida en CPP causada por un priming de cocaina; por el contrario, el pretratamiento con SB-277011-A inhibio la restauracion de la CPP causada por el estres social. Tambien hemos observado que el pretratamiento con SB-277011-A inhibio la restauracion de la CPP causada por diferentes tipos de estres fisiologico. A nivel molecular, hubo cambios en la expresion de DAT y D3R en el NAc (shell) despues de la recaida en la CPP causada por un priming de cocaina y el estres social. Ademas, hemos encontrado que la cascada de senalizacion de Akt-mTOR podria acoplarse a D3R debido a un aumento en la expresion de pAkt y pmTOR en el NAc despues de la recaida en la CPP causada por un priming de cocaina y el estres social. En la recaida en la CPP inducida por un priming de cocaina o por estres social se modifico la expresion D3R y DAT en BLA, pero no en DG hipocampal. Hubo una disminucion en la activacion de mTOR en BLA y DG despues del restablecimiento de CPP inducido por priming de cocaina o estres social. En conclusion, nuestros resultados sugieren que el antagonismo de D3R podria ser un objetivo farmacologico en la prevencion de la recaida inducida por el estres en el consumo de cocaina. Ademas, los resultados actuales son consistentes con la hipotesis de que D3R jugaria un papel importante en el restablecimiento de la busqueda de cocaina. EnglishDrug addiction constitutes a serious public health problem at the international level. Among them, cocaine continues to be the most widely used illegal stimulant drug in Europe, with the highest prevalence in southern and western countries, as is the case in Spain. Addiction can be defined as a chronic and recurrent mental disorder characterized by the compulsive search for the drug. During long periods of abstinence there is a high risk of relapse in consumption, therefore, its prevention has become an object of study for the management of addiction due to the lack of effective therapies to avoid them. The importance of studying relapses is that they can be triggered by both stressful stimuli and by re-exposure to the drug itself. These same triggers are used to re-establish drug-associated behaviors in animal models. The Pavlovian paradigm of drug-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) is used to evaluate the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse. As a consequence, the Objectives of this work have been: - To evaluate the possible involvement of the dopaminergic receptor D3 (D3R) in the relapse in cocaine use, since accumulated evidence indicates that antagonists of these receptors seem to be very promising in attenuating cocaine reward and relapse in preclinical models of addiction. - To study if D3R is involved in the increase of plasma corticosterone levels during relapse in CPP. - To test the changes in the expression of DAT and D3R in the NAc shell during the relapse in the CPP caused by stress and by a priming of cocaine in mice conditioned to cocaine; in addition, we studied if the D3R blockade prevents the modifications those expression. - To investigate the changes in the mTOR cascade in BLA and DG in the relapse in CPP induced by cocaine priming and social stress. The methodology developed has been divided into two phases, first a behavioral study using the CPP has been carried out, and then a molecular study by processing the samples obtained (brain and plasma) to interpret the changes that occurred in the first phase. The different experimental groups of male mice of the C57BL/6 strain were conditioned with cocaine at a dose of 25 mg/kg for four days. On the fifth day, a post-conditioning test (Post-C) was performed and then, for 7-8 weeks, the CPP was extinguished (ext). Once the addictive behavior had ceased, the possible involvement of D3R in the restoration of cocaine-induced CPP was studied. For that, thirty minutes before the administration of a cocaine priming dose or a single stress episode (SD, immobilization or pain), we administered a single dose of the selective D3R antagonist, SB-277011-A. The doses administered in each group were a) 24 or 48 mg/kg, i.p. for the cocaine priming group, immobilization stress and pain stress; b) 12 or 24 mg/kg, i.p. for the SD stress group. Control animals received a vehicle injection (deionized water, 1 ml/kg, i.p.). In addition, plasma levels of corticosterone (as marker of stress) were quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after relapse. The results showed that blocking D3R with SB-277011-A did not antagonize the relapse in CPP caused by cocaine-prime; by contrast, pretreatment with SB-277011-A inhibited the restoration of CPP caused by social stress. We have also observed that pretreatment with SB-277011-A inhibited the restoration of CPP caused by different types of physiological stress. At the molecular level, there were changes in the expression of DAT and D3R in the NAc shell after the relapse in CPP caused by cocaine priming and social stress. In addition, we have found that the Akt-mTOR signaling cascade could be coupled to D3R due to an increase in the expression of pAkt and pmTOR in the NAc after the relapse in CPP caused by cocaine priming and social stress. Relapse in CPP induced by cocaine priming or social stress modified D3R and DAT expression in BLA, but not in hippocampal DG. There was a decrease in mTOR activation in BLA and DG after reinstatement of CPP induced by cocaine priming or social stress. In conclusion, our results suggest that D3R antagonism could be a pharmacological target in the prevention of stress-induced relapse in the consumption of cocaine. Furthermore, present results are consistent with the hypothesis that D3R would play an important role in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking.",

      "abstract": "Food-drug interactions are defined as alterations of pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of a drug or nutritional element or a compromise in nutritional status as a result of the addition of a drug. Elderly patients are particularly at risk because more than 30% of all the prescription drugs are taken by this population. Failure to identify and properly manage drug-nutrient interactions can lead to serious consequences. For instance, drug-nutrient interactions can result in reduced absorption of certain oral antibiotics and may lead to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection. This predisposes the patient to treatment failure. Induction or inhibition of enzymes in the gut by nutrients may lead to a significant change in oral bioavailability of drugs or vice versa. For example, grapefruit juice is a selective intestinal CYP3A4 inhibitor. The overall exposure of some drugs can be increased by more than fivefold when taken with grapefruit juice and increase the risk of adverse effects. The use of certain drugs may affect GI tract function and may lead to a loss of bodily electrolytes and fluid. Limiting drug prescriptions to essential medications for as short a period as possible and periodic re-evaluations of the treatment chosen are essential to minimize adverse drug-nutrient interactions.",

Die ungebrochene und durch geschickte Werbebotschaften verstärkte Attraktivität des Rauchens als Bestandteil eines modernen, Freiheit und Jugendlichkeit verkörpernden Lebensstils erhöht zusammen mit genetischen, psychischen und sozialen Belastungen das Risiko, mit Tabak zu experimentieren und viele Jahre nicht mehr aufhören zu können. Insbesondere Jugendliche mit chronischen Erkrankungen wie Asthma bronchiale oder Diabetes geraten dadurch in eine Doppelbelastung. Auch die hohe Zahl junger RaucherInnen im Reproduktionsalter gibt wegen der daraus resultierenden Probleme Anlass zur Sorge. In den letzten Jahren konnten in bescheidenen Ansätzen Interventionsprogramme zur Reduktion der Raucherquote entwickelt werden. Deutlicher Mangel herrscht vor allem an wirksamen Strategien zur Abstinenzmotivation und zum Rauchstopp. Hier sind auch Ärztinnen und Ärzte gefordert, ihren Beitrag zu leisten. Auf die bestehenden Möglichkeiten versucht dieser Aufsatz aufmerksam zu machen. Nachhaltig können jedoch nur drastische gesundheitspolitische Maßnahmen, die in erster Linie die soziale Akzeptanz des Rauchens und letztlich die Zahl der erwachsenen Raucher vermindern, die «Tabakepidemie» auch im Jugendalter eindämmen. Das macht aber nur dann Sinn, wenn gleichzeitig die Ausbildungs- und Lebensperspektiven junger Menschen verbessert werden.",

High doses of some single nutrients may improve immunity in relatively short time periods (weeks to months), but persistence of these effects is not currently known. High doses of other micronutrients may adversely affect immunity. Some micronutrients may interfere with the beneficial effects of other micronutrients on immunity; this effect depends on relative doses. Low- to moderate-dose multivitamin/mineral supplements may require considerable time (6 mo to 1 yr or more) before they enhance immune functions and potentially reduce susceptibility to infectious diseases, and the timing of their effects may differ between men and women. High- and even low-dose micronutrient supplements may enhance immunity even in the absence of evidence of underlying deficiencies. Micronutrient supplements are not a substitute for a good diet and regular exercise but, rather, are a complementary measure. Long-term ingestion of single nutrient supplements, especially at high doses, may have beneficial and/or adverse effects on immunity and other outcomes.",

Dieting has been more common in recent years as more people strive to adhere to strict food plans in an effort to achieve their desired body weight and form. Unfortunately, this strategy may have unforeseen repercussions that could have a negative impact on one’s health. Insufficient calorie intake, for instance, might deprive the body of vital nutrients, resulting in malnutrition and a weakened immune system. Similar to too-restricted diets, irregular periods and even infertility can result from a disruption in the hormonal balance. Furthermore, dieting can lead to psychological distress, which in turn promotes disordered eating behaviors such as binge eating, purging, and other eating disorders. These disorders have the potential to have a long-term negative impact on physical and mental health, and in some situations, they may even be fatal. It’s important to exercise caution and knowledge when it comes to various diet regimens that are advertised on social media and online.",

      "title": "Understanding Rising Electronic Cigarette Use",
      "abstract": "Vaping is the act of inhaling an aerosol generated by an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), a battery-powered device that heats a reservoir of liquid, typically nicotine-containing, to deliver contents to the user. E-cigarettes were initially introduced as a means of smoking cessation, although evidence of their effectiveness is limited. There is a widespread perception that these products are a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, driven in large part by marketing efforts by e-cigarette manufacturers. Yet to achieve vaporization, temperatures are so high that components of the device hardware, such as metals, plastics, rubber and foam, are aerosolized and inhaled along with the vaporized e-liquid containing nicotine, flavoring and solvents. We do not fully understand the health consequences of such aerosol exposure, particularly long-term effects, but short-term negative cardiovascular and respiratory effects have been demonstrated. Very few studies have evaluated the reproductive effect of e-cigarette use. We do not know whether vaping during pregnancy affects birth outcomes or the lifelong health of the fetus. There has been an exponential rise in the use of e-cigarettes in the United States since their introduction, particularly among youths, while concurrently there has been a laudable reduction in conventional cigarette use. It is imperative that obstetrician–gynecologists have a basic understanding of e-cigarettes, screen all patients as is consistently done for conventional smoking, and provide resources to patients about potential negative consequences of use.",

      "abstract": "Extract Oral hygiene in older people Key concepts The importance of teeth Teeth are important for chewing a wide range of food, and also for social and cosmetic reasons. Tooth retention is associated with better quality of life. A minimum of 21 teeth, arranged in opposable pairs, are needed in order to eat a varied diet. People with fewer teeth will require dentures to eat efficiently. Recent studies have shown that over 20% of nursing home residents have significant unmet oral health needs, and those with dementia often have even poorer oral health. Poor oral health has adverse consequences such as bad breath, toothache, bleeding gums, tooth loss, and poor nutrition. It is therefore important to promote good oral healthcare in the future older population. Normal ageing of the teeth and mouth Teeth naturally alter colour with age, both as a consequence of increased levels of mineralization in dentine making it more opaque, and from extrinsic staining related to tea, coffee, and other products. Gum recession may occur, exposing more of the root of the tooth (hence the phrase ‘long in the tooth’), making teeth technically more challenging to clean. Teeth will become more worn as a result of chewing and sometimes bruxism. The numbers of taste buds decline from middle age and result in a less sensitive sense of taste, which when combined with reductions in the sense of smell reduces people's enjoyment of food. There are significant reductions in the orofacial musculature, making chewing a more laborious process. Thinning of the oral mucosa may result in increased sensitivity to stimuli and a sense of burning in the mouth. The bone of the jaws may be affected by osteoporosis, although when teeth are present the jaw remains a functional matrix.",

      "abstract": "understand the effects of tenure, it is useful to consider the effects of alcohol: The first draught is usually medicinal. The elixir is a shield against unbearable pain. It is administered, perhaps, as an antidote to stress or to cope with trauma. But what begins as a means to succor from physical and psychological suffering imperceptibly but inevitably becomes an end in itself. Without recognizing it, one grows dependent on the drug. It gradually begins to distort one's sense of reality and leads to saying and doing things one would not have done in a nonaddicted state. Often, it leads to a kind of languor and to neglect of important tasks. The alcoholic's once bright potential slips away in a haze of paranoia, hostility, irresponsibility, and self -disrespect. But, significantly, the alcoholic will not, cannot, admit to the addiction. The alcoholic invents all sorts of reasons why he or she cannot live without drink. The alcoholic is consumed by fear of life without a support line. And try as he might to avoid it, there is an inescapable and terrible fact that the alcoholic must ultimately face: There is only one sure cure for alcoholism-abstinence . Like alcohol to alcoholics, tenure is too important to the American professoriat. Among a sample of humanities professors, tenure was ranked as the most significant factor to be considered when seeking a job, and a cross-section of the general professorial population ranked it a close second to money. Moreover, where tenure was once a means to the noble end of unfettered pursuit of knowledge, it has now become an end in itself. The evidence of this can be seen in the transformation of the American Association of University Professors from a professional JAMES OTOOLE, a social anthropologist, is director of the Twenty Year Forecast project at the University of Southern California, where he is an associate professor of management in the Graduate School of Business.

It impacts all aspects of a person's life; mental, physical, emotional, and social. Drug addiction is responsible for more deaths, illnesses, and disabilities than any other avoidable health problem. In the last century, most people decrease their use of smoking tobacco, and alcohol abuse but there are significantly elevated rates of using drugs. In some countries, they found that the use of the drug is more in males, and in other countries found more in females than males, it differs from one culture to other probably depend on many factors. Adolescents there are curious to deviate in ways even the competent of them and increase overtime with prevalence of newer drugs. They start using it at youth age, and most of them are university students. They think that it improves their life and academic performance, and they are easily influenced by their bad friends. In Sudan nowadays, we notice that drug abuse becomes a national issue because drug dealers and drugs user become at a higher rate than in the past, also the number of deaths from overdose is increasing, so we need more research about it. The Drug Enforcement Administration in every country spends a lot of money to catch drug dealers, stop cannabis delivery, and ended it to save their nation. It affects individual lives and then affects the community which leads to delays in the development of our country. In this Review, we discuss the effect of drugs on the most important aspects of adolescents' life.",

      "abstract": "Even if most people use cannabis without many negative consequences, some experience cannabis related harms. At higher levels of intake, one of these harms could be psychotic symptoms and even cannabis-induced psychosis. During the last years, we have seen increased treatment seeking for cannabis use disorders in Europe. Parallel with this increase we have seen an increase in the incidence of cannabis induced psychosis in all Scandinavian countries and an increased population attributable fraction for cannabis on the prevalence of schizophrenia has been demonstrated. All this may reflect increased use of cannabis, but more likely increased content of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is most cannabis products. Many have also pointed to the fact that we have seen an increase in the incidence of schizophrenia in the same period, maybe attributable to cannabis use. If we also take into consideration that up to one third of those with cannabis-induced psychosis over time receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, we may see at least two implications. Firstly, these findings strengthens the evidence for a causative relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia, a causative relationship that man have suggested for several years, but that has had some opponents. Secondly, it points to cannabis-induced psychosis should be considered to be a part of the ICD-10 F2-chapter rather than the F1-chapter. This may be true also for the other substance-induced psychosis (F1x.5). An additional argument for this is that for no other psychotic diagnosis, a precipitation factor is mentioned in the diagnosis. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Impact de l’anxiété, de la dépression et de l’hostilité en tant que composants de la détresse psychologique sur la typologie de consommation d’alcool et de cannabis chez l’adolescent selon l’âge et le sexe",
      "abstract": "La consommation abusive de substances psychotropes chez les adolescents constitue un probleme de sante societale ayant plusieurs repercussions (Ministere de la Sante et des Services Sociaux du Quebec [MSSSQ], 2008). L’alcool et le cannabis sont habituellement les premieres substances psychotropes consommees a l’adolescence, tout en etant celles qui sont les plus consommees chez cette population, nonobstant le tabac. Les taux de consommation populationnels sur une periode de 12 mois, chez les adolescents, pour ces substances psychotropes sont estimes a 56,8% pour l’alcool et 22,9% pour le cannabis (Institut de la Statistique du Quebec [ISQ], 2013). Certains adolescents consomment ces deux substances de facon simultanee ou sur une periode prolongee, phenomene appele la polyconsommation (Ives & Ghelani, 2006). La polyconsommation, selon une etude de Font-Mayolas et ses collaborateurs (2013), se manifesterait chez 30% des etudiants du secondaire. Elle comprend plusieurs typologies de substances possibles, dont les plus frequentes sont un melange alcool-tabac, alcool-cannabis ou alcool-tabac-cannabis. D’ailleurs, les adolescents qui souffrent d’une detresse psychologique seraient plus a risque de developper des comportements de consommations de psychotropes problematiques (p. ex., Armstrong & Costello, 2002). Considerant ces dernieres informations, cette etude a pour but de mieux comprendre ce phenomene en cherchant a identifier des predicteurs specifiques de la detresse psychologique qui sont les plus importants pour expliquer le developpement de typologies de consommation de substances psychotropes distinctes. Concretement, les variables considerees dans cette recherche sont les suivantes : la symptomatologie depressive, anxieuse et hostile, en tant que composant de la detresse psychologique, l’âge, le sexe et trois typologies precises de consommation de psychotropes et une typologie de non-consommateurs soit : 1) absence de consommation, 2) consommation faible d’alcool, 3) consommation elevee d’alcool et 4) polyconsommation elevee d’alcool et de cannabis). Cette etude a ete realisee aupres d'un echantillon de 910 adolescents, âges entre 12 et 17 ans. Parmi ceux-ci, 487 etaient des filles et 423 des garcons. L'ensemble des participants a ete recrute dans sept ecoles secondaires de la region du Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean. Trois questionnaires d'evaluation ont permis la cueillette de donnees, soit un questionnaire sociodemographique, le SCL-90-R (Derogatis, 1994) et la Grille de depistage de consommation problematique d'alcool et de drogues chez les adolescents et adolescentes (DEP-ADO) (Germain et al., 2007). Eu regard aux facteurs de risque et de protection quant a la typologie de la consommation de substances psychotropes, l’ensemble des analyses a finalement permis de constater que le modele propose – comprenant la symptomatologie depressive, anxieuse et hostile a titre de facteurs independants, de meme que l’âge et le sexe a titre de facteurs d’interactions et aussi independants – est pertinent en ce qui a trait a la typologie de consommation de substances psychotropes. En effet, la consideration de ces facteurs et leurs implications dans certains termes d’interaction ont permis d’expliquer plus que le tiers de la variance concernant les groupes typologiques de consommation. Pour ce qui est des facteurs de risque, l’âge, l’hostilite, l’anxiete chez les adolescentes et le fait d’etre un adolescent sont des facteurs pertinents qui permettent de prevoir l’initiation a la consommation. L’âge et, a un point moindre, l’hostilite sont quant a eux des facteurs pertinents qui permettent de prevoir la transition d’une typologie faible de consommation de psychotropes (c.-a-d., une consommation faible d’alcool) a une typologie lourde de consommation de psychotropes (c.-a-d., une consommation elevee d’alcool ou une polyconsommation elevee d’alcool et de cannabis). Pour ce qui est des facteurs de protection, la depression et le fait d’etre une adolescente diminuent la probabilite d’initiation a la consommation de psychotropes. D’autres analyses statistiques montrent que la detresse psychologique, sous ses formes depressives, anxieuses et d’hostilite, agit presque exclusivement a titre de facteur de risque chez les adolescentes en ce qui a trait a la typologie de consommation. Cette recherche se distingue par l’importance qu’elle a accordee a decrire de maniere precise les facteurs impliques dans la caracterisation des typologies de consommation de substances psychotropes en s’interessant aux facteurs specifiques de detresse psychologique, soit la depression, l’anxiete et l’hostilite, de meme qu’aux facteurs sociodemographiques, tels l’âge et le sexe en tant que variables predictives et d’interaction. En ce qui a trait aux principales retombees secondaires, les donnees recueillies ont permis de formuler un descriptif regional de la consommation de substances psychotropes des adolescents. Consequemment, les interventions preventives qui peuvent en decouler pourront ameliorer les strategies de traitement et ainsi le bien-etre de ces adolescents.",

Substance use, including heavy drinking, often occurs at the expense of other, substance-free, activities. This review examines the promotion of one specific substance-free activity—exercise—as an intervention for hazardous drinking. Exercise has numerous physical and mental health benefits, and data suggest that students who engage in exercise regularly are less likely to drink heavily. However, the adherence to exercise necessary to achieve these benefits and possibly reduce drinking is poor, and improved exercise adherence interventions are needed. A novel combination of motivational enhancement therapy and contingency management is discussed as a means to address the critical issue of exercise adherence.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs has become a concern in high-performance athletes. Professional athletes are more exposed to drugs than the general population. Although some drugs are unquestionably detrimental to performance, several studies have nevertheless shown evidence of increased consumption of these substances within this sub-population. This review aimed to elucidate alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, cannabis, and opioid use among high-performance athletes, discussing the prevalence of substance use, its impacts, and alternatives to treatment in this special population. Unfortunately, no clinical trials for the treatment of substance use disorders were carried out with this specific sub-population. Therefore, the strategies adopted for the general population should be adapted to high-performance athletes. Psychological, psychosocial, psychoeducational, cognitive-behavioural, motivational interviewing approaches can be implemented. As regards pharmacological treatment, medications used in the treatment of alcohol and tobacco dependence, such as naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate, varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement treatment can be used without problems. However, some medications used in cocaine and opioid dependence treatment, such as moldafinil and methadone, are prohibited by doping enforcement agencies. Professionals involved with athletes should be aware of the signs and symptoms of the acute effects of substances so as to enable an early identification of substance abuse problems, especially during training periods.",

      "title": "Smoking cessation changes basic metabolism, body weight, leptin and insulin levels, adipose tissue percentage, index of insulin resistance and index of insulin secretion",
      "abstract": "Background It is known that nicotine increases energy expenditure, basic metabolism and has appetite-suppressing properties, which likely explains why smokers tend to have lower body weight than non-smokers and why smoking cessation is followed by weight gain up to 12 kgr (7 kgr in median). Thus smoking cessation often has the disadvantage of increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome; fact that both decreases the benefits of smoking cessation and can discourage smokers (mostly women) from quitting. On the top of that, weight gain has been found to increase the risk of relapse, particularly among normalweight or underweight women who report chronic dieting, but also among men. Varenicline is a nicotiniccholinergic receptor partial agonist and therefore should share nicotine’s properties. Thus we believe that during its intake for three months in the process of smoking cessation basic metabolism will be sustained in levels comparable to these while smoking. During this period ex-smokers are also protected from withdrawal syndromes and thus capable of following psychological and physical activity counselling in order to sustain stable body weight. Quitting smoking is a process of changing life habits and is extremely difficult due to the addictive properties of nicotine. Post cessation weight gain decreases the benefits and leads to increased relaption rates. Varenicline improves succession and decrease relaption rates. Materials and methods During the three months period of varenicline intake, we enrolled 15 smokers that visited our smoking cessation clinic and succeeded in quitting smoking. Eight used varenicline. Basic metabolism and body weight were measured before (BSC) and one month after smoking cessation (ASC).",

      "abstract": "Sleep is an important part of overall health and well-being. Without proper sleep, our thoughts get foggy, and we have trouble remembering things. On top of that, other parts of our bodies start to work less efficiently. For example, messed up sleep can cause changes in immune or metabolic systems that can promote disease or make certain diseases worse! Despite what we already know, not all the causes of sleep disruption are well understood. We all know now that smoking cigarettes is bad for your health, and a lot of evidence suggests that pregnant mothers who smoke cigarettes have children that have sleep problems. These problems may promote disease or interfere with life when the child grows up. Here, we will discuss three things: (1) How do we know what parts of the brain control sleep and how can we measure sleep in animals? (2) How do cigarettes alter the function of the brain and body? and (3) How can a smoking mother alter her child’s sleep all the way into adulthood?",

      "title": "E-cigarette, Changing Paradigm: ‘Trojan Horse’ or ‘Harm Reduction’",
      "abstract": "There is ongoing debate within the public health community as to whether e-cigarettes have a potential role in smoking cessation; whether use of e-cigarettes can reduce harm for individual users; whether widespread use of the devices has the potential to reduce or increase population-level harm; and how best to regulate e-cigarettes to minimize both individual and population-level harm.but Although the long-term effects of e-cigarette use are not known, producing nicotine aerosol from a solution rather than by burning tobacco gives rise to fewer harmful substances than cigarette smoke does to smokers and non-smokers.Because of the likely lesser health risks associated with vaping, some experts advocate wider availability and softer regulation, and see e-cigarettes as holding great potential to help smokers quit or switch to a harm-reducing way to consume nicotine.Others argue that it is not sound public health policy to allow e-cigarettes onto the market until such time as robust evidence is available supporting the safety of e-cigarettes and their efficacy in reducing harm.They cite the addictiveness of nicotine, and the potential for harm from ongoing use of e-cigarettes compared with complete cessation of all nicotine and tobacco products.Other serious issues include the possibilities that e-cigarette use might promote nicotine use among non-smokers, especially children; serve to renormalise smoking; or serve as a gateway to the use of combustible cigarettes or illicit drugs.On the bases of the scientific evidence on e-cigarette, this article explore benefits and harms to public health to guide practice, policy, and regulation through reviewing two major reports and special debate articles.A reframing of societal nicotine use through the lens of 'harm reduction' is an extraordinary opportunity to enhance the impact of tobacco control efforts in Korea.",

Constipation that is not secondary to underlying disease or caused by factors such as side-effects of drugs or laxative abuse is known as simple constipation. Its causes include insufficient fluid and fibre in the diet, failure to respond to the urge to defaecate, and lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise or mobility, stress, and long-haul air travel. These can often be resolved without recourse to medication, but short-term use of a laxative may be helpful in restoring normal bowel function.",

      "title": "Pengaruh merokok bagi remaja dan pergaulan sehari hari",
      "abstract": "Pada kehidupan remaja saat ini, merokok merupakan suatu pemandangan yang sangat tidak asing. Kebiasaan merokok dianggap dapat memberikan kenikmatan bagi perokok, namun di lain pihak dapat menimbulkan dampak buruk bagi perokok sendiri maupun orang-orang disekitarnya. Berbagai kandungan zat yang terdapat di dalam rokok memberikan dampak negatif pada tubuh penghisapnya. Sekarang ini kegiatan merokok juga banyak dilakukan oleh remaja yang biasanya dilakukan di depan orang lain, terutama dilakukan di depan kelompoknya karena mereka sangat tertatik kepada kelompok sebayanya atau dengan kata lain terikat dengan kelompoknya. Hal ini sebenarnya telah diketahui oleh remaja khususnya dan umumnya masyarakat dunia, bahwa merokok itu mengganggu kesehatan. Masalah rokok pada hakekatnya sudah menjadi masalah nasional,bahkan internasional. Pemerintah tentunya juga tidak tinggal diam atas fenomena banyaknya kebiasaan merokok pada kalangan masyarakat,khususnya kalangan remaja yang masih berstatus pelajar. Selain kebijakan-kebijakan pemerintah akan larangan merokok diberbagai tempat umum seperti rumah sakit, di kantor-kantor, lingkungan sekolahan, serta tempat umum lainnya tentunya pemerintah juga mengeluarkan peraturan yang sah seperti 3HUDWXUDQ 3HPHULQWDK 5, 1RPRU 7DKXQ WHQWDQJ ³3HQJDPDQDQ 5RNRN %DJL.HVHKDWDQ¥\\DQJGLNeluarkan resmi oleh Presiden. Masalah perilaku mengkonsumsi rokok tidak hanya terjadi pada kalangan remaja ataupun kalangan pelajar pada masyarakat kota metropolis saja, akan tetapi sehubungan dengan berbagai pengaruh dan perilaku remaja karena pergaulan, maka pemuda atau remaja bahkan pelajar di pedesaan saja juga telah banyak yang melakukan kegiatan merokok. Termasuk dalam hal ini para pelajar SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Dari kondisi itulah maka dalam penelitian ini akan mengangkat topik dan masalah penelitian tentang perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Penulis merasa tertarik untuk melaksanakan penelitian ini karena kehidupan remaja khususnya para pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar sebagian besar merokok. Bahkan tidak hanya dilingkungan Sekolahan tempat penelitian saja tetapi secara umum merebak keseluruh penjuru pelosok desa di sekitar tempat penelitian. Adapun rumusan masalah yang menjadi dasar penilitian mengenai perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar,yaitu; (1)Apa yang mendorong seorang pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar, memiliki perilaku merokok?(2)Apa dampak yang ditimbulkan",

The smoking habits of my neighbors are likely to shape my own smoking habits, due to what is known in economics as “peer effects.” These complementarities in behavior may result from emulation, joint consumption, conformism, incomplete information and so on. Academics and policy makers seem to universally acknowledge that the social network in which agents are embedded, take decisions and consume, is one of the key elements, together with tastes and various demographics, in determining the smoking behavior of people. This article discusses how accounting for the external effects of smoking (second-hand smoke) and for the concern that people have for their friends and relatives who are exposed to such effects, can help interpret some of the recent trends in smoking behavior, and possibly suggest how to tune anti-smoking policies.",

Drug use is a firm and accepted part of our culture; indeed, we are a drug-oriented society. People of all ages utilize a variety of prescription and non-prescription chemicals to alter symptoms, feelings, moods, or mind-states. Drug abuse applies to taking drugs in a manner that is organically or psychologically destructive, either because of the nature of the drug used or the quantity consumed. The term \"abuse\" unfortunately has been used pejoratively at times to criticize any drug use that is threatening, for real or imagined reasons, to the dominant society and its mores. Drug abuse is not a phenomenon restricted to contemporary youth; the significant point of distinction between the generations is that each has its \"own\" favourites. Alcohol, nicotine, tranquillizers, sedatives, stimulants, and pain relievers—traditional drugs—are as susceptible to use and to abuse as are the drugs more commonly favoured by the younger generation.",

There is plenty of evidence that drinking alcohol causes many acute or chronic health problems to the drinkers themselves, and in some cases also to someone else. Therefore, there is no doubt that in the countries where alcohol is consumed in abundance, as EU countries (see e.g. Simpura, 1995), drinking endangers public health.

A recent conference presented by the Atlanta Coalition Against Tobacco (Athletics or Tobacco?

Many coaches make the use of tobacco a grounds for suspension, which obviously gets a very clear message across to the student athlete. Students are also quite aware of the effect of tobacco use on performance and that some activities such as competitive track competition are virtually incompatible",

      "title": "E-cigarettes: promise or threat?",
      "abstract": "Use of the electronic cigarette or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) is increasing globally. Its vapour delivers nicotine without the 6000 odd chemicals released during cigarette smoking and the associated harm. Experts are divided on whether ENDS promise reduction in tobacco use or threaten tobacco control. This review presents up-to-date evidence. Two trials showed an increase in cessation, but not a reduction in cigarette use. Eight cohort studies showed no increase in cessation, and two cohort studies and a recent trial showed an increased reduction in cigarette use. A US population study showed association between ENDS use and smoking cessation. Nicotine addiction and potential harm to non-smokers who use ENDS are key concerns. Nicotine affects lung and brain development. An increase in accidental poisoning, though mild, is reported in children. No significant short term health effects are reported. When heated, ENDS may emit potential toxic and carcinogenic substances such as aldehydes, acrolein, flavouring agents etc. at very low levels - but their long term impact is not known. ENDS bring potential benefits to smokers, but there are concerns about their potential for nicotine addiction, gateway effect and renormalisation of smoking. However, in the UK and the US, a rise in ENDS use is associated with a fall in the prevalence of smoking. Countries differ in their approach to ENDS. India seems to be edging towards a total ban. India should collect local data and conduct research to monitor the impact and make informed, evidence based decisions, where needed.",

      "title": "How to Treat Nicotine Dependence in Smokers with Schizophrenia: Improve Patients' Health, Help Them Kick Addiction with This Practical Approach",
      "abstract": "Mr. V, age 49, has stable but symptomatic schizophrenia and a 33-year cigarette smoking history. He is very concerned because his primary care physician told him he has 2 serious smoking-related health problems: diabetes and hypertension. He tried a smoking cessation program for the general public, but it was a poor fit because of his schizophrenia symptoms. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Despite adhering to his medications (ziprasidone, 20 mg hs; perphenazine, 8 mg hs; lorazepam, 1 mg hs; zonisamide, 200 mg/d, and benztropine mesylate, 2 mg hs), Mr. V has residual auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and impaired concentration and attention. He smokes approximately 1.5 packs per day, particularly when very ill, to alleviate chronic boredom, and to diminish distress from the hallucinations. All of his friends smoke, and they do not support his attempts to quit. Successfully treating nicotine dependence can seem a formidable challenge in patients with schizophrenia: * 72% to 90% smoke cigarettes, compared with 21% of the general population1 (Box, page 66). (2-12) * They tend to smoke heavily, spending about one-third of their incomes on cigarettes. (13) * Their negative symptoms (such as apathy), positive symptoms (such as disorganized thinking), and cognitive impairment can reduce motivation to quit and adhere to a smoking cessation strategy. * Sociologic and physiologic aspects of schizophrenia reinforce their smoking habit (Table 1, page 69). (9,12,14-17) Even so, smokers with schizophrenia can be highly motivated and persistent in attempting to quit. (18) Promising results have been reported in trials when psychopharmacologic treatments are combined with cognitive and behavioral interventions. This article reviews these empiric studies and suggests practical ways for clinicians to create smoking cessation and relapse prevention plans for individuals with schizophrenia. Clinical trials of smoking cessation Inadequate interventions. Conventional regimens--consisting of 8 to 12 weeks with sustained-release bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) added to supportive or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) (19)--are well-tolerated by patients with schizophrenia but only modestly effective. CBT alone (or with placebo) has not been effective for smoking cessation in schizophrenia. In clinical trials, abstinence rates have been: * 4% to 19% after 3 to 6 months with bupropion or NRT and CBT * [less than or equal to]6% with placebo and CBT. (20-23) Multifaceted interventions. High-dose NRT patch treatment (2 patches at a time) has not consistently shown additional benefits compared with single-patch treatment. (24,25) However, combining short-acting NRT (gum, lozenge, inhaler, or nasal spray) with a long-acting NRT preparation (transdermal patch) is well-tolerated and has been shown to improve sustained abstinence rates (26) (Table 2, page 70). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, (27) 51 smokers with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive combination NRT (21-mg NRT patch plus [less than or equal to]18 mg/d NRT polacrilex gum prn) added to bupropion SR, 150 mg bid, or placebo. Smoking cessation--defined as quitting on the assigned date and maintaining continuous abstinence for 4 weeks (measured by expired air carbon monoxide * 52% of those receiving bupropion and dual NRT * 19% who received placebo and the 2 forms of NRT. Preventing relapse. Relapse is common among all smokers but especially in those with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, 70% to 83% of smokers with schizophrenia who attained abstinence relapsed to smoking within 6 to 12 months of stopping nicotine dependence treatment. (21,22,27,28) In one clinical trial, >50% of patients achieved 4 weeks of continuous abstinence on a regimen of bupropion SR, 150 mg bid; nicotine patch (21 mg/d); and as-needed nicotine gum ([less than or equal to]18 mg/d). …",

      "abstract": "According to the European Drug and Drug Addiction Observatory, after Cannabis, Cocaine is the most widely used illegal drug in Europe. Awareness of the damage caused by consuming this substance is clear in some areas, while in others it may be ignored, underestimated or poorly dimensioned. The information systems that do exist almost certainly underestimate the number of deaths connected with cocaine. Apart from the potential the drug has to cause direct damage to different organs of the body, its consumption can lead to serious problems arising from other circumstances that are not always connected with this drug, including murders, traffic accidents and accidents at work, infectious diseases related to high-risk behaviour, and suicides. Cocaine is increasingly present in cases of violence such as fights or aggression, in many cases accompanied by the use of knives and firearms. Serious behavioural disorders are being seen more and more frequently in the healthcare services, and in clinics we are witnessing a worrying increase on a day-to-day basis of conflictive episodes associated with the use of cocaine amongst our patients. This damage does not only affect a marginal population, but instead all levels of society, and often goes unnoticed or unreported. Coordination between different institutions and healthcare areas is essential in order to obtain this information, and in this way to provide a more precise picture of the consequences of Cocaine consumption, as today we are still far from having quantified its true dimension.",

This is especially true of older women, who are weaker than men and become disabled and dependent in the later years at a much greater rate. Exercise can increase the body's metabolism and make it more efficient in burning calories. Physical fitness also makes respiration more efficient. Evidence suggests strongly that the physically fit live 2 to 3 years longer and have a better quality of life than sedentary individuals. Any time is the best time for a person of any age to start exercising. Exercise is movement--dancing, walking, lifting a weight, using the body. Older individuals tend to be willing to exercise if they are given appropriate recommendations and follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Stress management is the need of the hour. However hard we try to go beyond a stress situation, life seems to find new ways of stressing us out and plaguing us with anxiety attacks.There can be innumerable stress factors since different individuals react differently to the same stress conditions. The brain doesn’t differentiate between real and imagined stress. Failure in adopting a realistic attitude to events creates symptoms of depression and aggravates stress situations.Do “stressed out” parents necessarily have stressed out kids? Besides being at higher genetic risk for stress, children of stressed parents can also learn the tendency to get stressed out in reaction to life’s challenges from their parents.”Children of stressed out parents are more likely to be ill equipped to handle stressors positively. Research shows that nicotine dependency actually increases stress levels in smokers-adults and adolescence alike. Adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking. The repeated occurrence of stressed moods between smoking means that smokers tend to experience distinctly above-average levels of daily stress. When adults quit smoking, they become less stressed rather than more stressed. Reduces stress hormones (studies shows, laughter induces reduction of at least four of neuroendocrine hormones—epinephrine, cortisol, dopac, and growth hormone, associated with stress response).It is well known that either a quick or constant stress can induce risky mind-body disorders. Stressed out individuals carry a great deal of physical tension in their bodies. Under stress the stiff muscles restrict the circulation of blood. Yogic asanas, meditation and breathing can help stress affected persons in many ways such as:(1)Reduce stress and tension, and (2) Mindfulness meditation helps stress reduction, improving physical and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Concurrent drug misuse is an increasing trend among alcoholics. It is occurring in an age-dependent manner so that the younger the age, the higher the incidence of concurrent misuse. Drugs concurrently misused by alcoholics, in decreasing order of frequency, are marijuana, cocaine and other sympathomimetics, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and psychedelics. Because of increasing prevalence of concurrent misuse, evaluation for alcohol detoxification should always include consideration of other drugs. Concurrent alcohol/drug addiction in alcoholics as well as increased incidence in alcoholism in families of drug addicts suggest a common genetic vulnerability to alcoholism and drug addiction.",

      "abstract": "A “functional food” is a food-based product that provides a demonstrable physiological benefit beyond its dietary or nutritional value. This class of foods for specific health uses are designed to assist in the prevention or treatment of disease, or to enhance and improve human capacities. They include products like vitamin-fortified grains, energy bars, low-fat or low-sodium foods, and sports drinks. Three sets of concerns about functional foods deserve attention. 1) Their health benefits are greatly exaggerated and, in many cases, non-existent; practical questions remain about their efficacy. 2) Their medicinal properties blur the boundaries between food and drugs; public health questions remain about their appropriate use, distribution, and regulation. 3) Their proliferation is fueled by the food industry, not by the medical profession; political questions remain about the role of market forces that too often benefit producers more than consumers.",

      "abstract": "O alcoolismo e uma doenca definida como um estado fisico e/ou psiquico onde se caracteriza a necessidade do individuo de ingerir a substância constantemente, no intuito de sentir seus efeitos psiquicos ou fazer cessar os sintomas da abstinencia da mesma. O consumo abusivo de alcool traz inumeras consequencias para a saude e qualidade de vida, aumentando a frequencia de morbimortalidade, causando diversas limitacoes funcionais.Em todo o mundo, enormes recursos estao sendo investidos em campanhas contra o abuso do alcool.A OMS, por exemplo, estabelece que uma dose padrao contenha aproximadamente de 10 a 12 g de alcool puro, o equivalente a uma lata de cerveja (350 mL), ou chope (330 mL), uma taca de vinho (100 mL), ou uma dose de destilado (30 mL). Alguns individuos metabolizam o alcool melhor que outros. A principal via de eliminacao do etanol ocorre por meio de oxidacao do mesmo a acetaldeido e posteriormente em acido e agua. Estas reacoes sao catalisadas pelas enzimas Alcool desidrogenase (ADH) e Aldeido desidrogenase (ALDH). Neste contexto, o empenho cientifico deste estudo para caracterizar a presenca de polimorfismos nos genes ADH e ALDH nos usuarios de alcool da regiao do Estado de Goias, faz-se necessario para se estabelecer uma possivel correlacao com o alcoolismo. Este estudo foi realizado no Centro de Recuperacao de Alcoolatras de Goias – regional Goiânia (CEREA GO) e no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Alcool e Drogas (CAPS AD). Para a realizacao dos experimentos, foi coletado uma amostra de sangue de cada paciente para extracao de DNA. Os ensaios foram realizados atraves da PCR em Tempo Real pelo sistema TaqMAn® SNP Genotyping Assays. As analises estatisticas foram feitas atraves dossoftware GENEPOP 4.5 e Haploview.Foram encontradas diferencas significativas para os SNPs estudados nas analises Caso versus Controle e Feminino versus Masculino. Alem disso, foi observada ligacao moderada de Linkage disequilibrium entre os SNPs ADH1B*2 e ADH1C*2 e a presenca de haplotipos atraves da segregacao dependente destes. Estes resultados sugerem, portanto, que estas variantes geneticas possam estar associadas a protecao ou dependencia ao alcoolismo na populacao estudada na cidade de Goiânia, GO, Brasil.",

      "abstract": "Hallucinogens are a drug class that is growing in popularity with college students. Recent experimental trends, such as microdosing, have helped promote the use of hallucinogens on campus, and students may be tempted to use these substances due to their beliefs about the drugs’ positive effects on mood. Although hallucinogens are not currently an established form of medical therapy, studies have shown that they have significant benefits as adjunctive treatments for psychological disorders. However, the recreational use of these drugs in college students often occurs in uncontrolled doses or with drug mixing, which is often dangerous. Furthermore, students with mental health disorders may have their symptoms masked by hallucinogenic drug use, which could delay treatment and have serious consequences. Long-term use of these drugs may also result in tolerance or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. This article attempts to review current information regarding hallucinogen use and how it applies to the college population.",

Metodologia O documento foi construído após uma revisão teórica sobre o tabaco e seus efeitos tóxicos aos seres humanos. O levantamento bibliográfico foi realizado utilizando-se as bases de dados PubMed, Lilacs, Scielo e Google Acadêmico. Resultado: o tabaco é uma mistura de aproximadamente 4.700 substâncias tóxicas que se distribuem em duas fases de compostos de elevado grau de toxicidade; abordamos a Nicotina e sua alta capacidade de gerar dependência; buscamos informar a dificuldade que um indivíduo tem de a abolir o hábito, pelo qual a nicotina produz efeitos que reforçam o seu uso. A severidade da dependência a nicotina pode ser ilustrada com o fato de que apenas 33% das pessoas que deixam de fumar sozinhas permanecem abstinentes por um período superior a 2 dias, e menos de 5% mantém-se abstinentes por mais de 1 ano. Conclusão: os avanços no controle do tabagismo dependem de uma visão de futuro baseada em metas, estratégias e rigidez nas políticas antitabagistas.",

N20 use has also become increasingly popular, and follows after cannabis and ecstasy use in prevalence rates. As with e-cigarette use, most users are not aware of potential health risks of N20 use, while particularly longer-term and heavy use may yield negative neurological and psychiatric effects.

Statistics show that more than 60 % of drug addicts are young people aged from 17 to 35 years. More than 20 % are children, students, and only 15 % are people older than 35 years. The use by mother during pregnancy psychoactive substances (PAS) is one of the major risk factor for congenital addiction. The most important risk factors for drug abuse are genetic ones. There are two main genetically dependent factors. The first factor is genetically determined high level of the dopamine which encourage a person on a constant search for new sensations, dissatisfaction peace, and search risky situations. The second one is a low level of the hormone serotonin which results in depression in stressful situations. The stressful situations become very deep. Certain factors increase the risk of addictive behavior of offspring may appear at birth. Many people who started the abuse at early age consciously preferred drug to alcohol. That is the adoption of alcohol caused them to aversion to alcohol because of the memories of his father-alcoholic. However based on the biological characteristics while it is not so easy to predict the likelihood of addiction and clearly define in advance the tendency or, on the contrary, human resistance to drug intoxication and dependence.",

Le phenomene du mulling (le fait de melanger du tabac au cannabis pour sa consommation) represente l'une des hypotheses les plus plausibles du risque augmente qu'ont les jeunes consommateurs de cannabis de devenir des futurs fumeurs de cigarettes.\nL'objectif principal de cette etude est de determiner si les niveaux de nicotine retrouves chez des fumeurs de cannabis sont suffisamment eleves pour prouver une exposition tabagique significative pouvant etre expliquee par le phenomene du mulling plutot que par l'environnement.",

      "title": "Non-Pharmacological and Pharmacological Interventions for Smoking Cessation Programs in Youth: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Smoking is one of the most preventable causes of mortality and morbidity among Canadians, yet the use of tobacco remains an important and challenging public health issue., The current Canadian youth are one of the first generations that are more likely to be aware than not of the health risks associated with traditional tobacco consumption (e.g., cigarettes, chewing tobacco). Even though the prevalence of traditional tobacco consumption by youth may be lower than previous generations,, there are added concerns with the most recent invention of vaping devices and e-cigarettes. Vaping is recognized to be associated with significant adverse events with short-term use and the long-term implications of such a novel technology are unknown., Taken together, preventing tobacco or nicotine consumption, in any form, among youth is critical.Pharmacological therapy, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline, are effective in helping the general population of smokers quit using tobacco. Non-pharmacological therapies may also be useful in assisting patients who are ready to quit smoking. Examples of non-pharmacological therapies include behavioural therapy, physician advice, telephone-based interventions, and group/peer or individual smoking cessation programs delivered in person or remotely. In certain populations, such as pregnant women, non-pharmacological therapy, specifically cognitive behavioural therapy, can be as effective as NRT. In addition, pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies can be used alone or as a combined therapy. Overall, there is less evidence regarding which interventions are most effective for youth (defined by the United Nations as 15 to 24 years).,To inform policy decisions about using pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation among youth, specific evidence is required. As such, this report aims to review the clinical effectiveness of using a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological smoking cessation interventions or non-pharmacological smoking cessation interventions alone for youth. The current report also aims to review evidence-based guidelines regarding smoking cessation interventions for youth.",

      "title": "Die Prävalenz und Ausprägung von Persönlichkeitsstörungen bei Ecstasykonsumenten",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung\r\n\r\nEcstasy ist die am haufigsten konsumierte synthetische Droge, im Jahr 2000 erreichte die Anzahl der vom BKA beschlagnahmten Tabletten erneut eine Rekordhohe. Gleichzeitig steigt die Zahl der Berichte uber medizinische Komplikationen – auch mit Todesfolge. Inzwischen mehren sich Hinweise darauf, das der dauerhafte Konsum groserer Mengen von Ecstasy neurotoxische Auswirkungen haben konnte, deren langfristige Folgen nicht absehbar sind.\r\nWelche Faktoren tragen zur Entwicklung eines Risikokonsums beziehungsweise einer Abhangigkeit bei? Bei Alkohol- und Drogenabhangigen konnte gezeigt werden, das Personlichkeitsstorungen, allen voran die antisoziale und Borderline Personlichkeitsstorung, einen starken Einflus auf die Entstehung, Aufrechterhaltung und den Verlauf der Erkrankung haben. Zum Missbrauch von Ecstasy ist die Datenlage diesbezuglich noch unzureichend.\r\n\r\nDies ist die erste Studie, die der Frage nach der Pravalenz und Auspragung von Personlichkeitsstorungen an einer groseren Stichprobe von Ecstasykonsumenten nachgegangen ist. Dazu wurden unter Verwendung zweier Selbstratinginstrumente (Personality Disorder Questionaire, PDQ-R und Inventar Klinischer Personlichkeitsakzentuierungen, IKP) 57 Ecstasykonsumenten (31 mannlich, 26 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 23 Jahre) mit 30 Konsumenten anderer illegaler Drogen (19 mannlich, 11 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 22 Jahre) sowie 7 Abstinenten (3 mannlich, 4 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 22 Jahre) verglichen. Im nachsten Schritt wurden die Ecstasykonsumenten nach dem Schweregrad des Konsums drei Gruppen zugeteilt, die ebenfalls miteinander verglichen wurden.\r\nNach den Ergebnissen der vorliegenden Studie haben Ecstasykonsumenten und insbesondere –abhangige im Vergleich zu ecstasy- sowie drogenabstinenten Kontrollen mit identischem subkulturellem Hintergrund, aber auch gegenuber der Allgemeinbevolkerung und gleichaltrigen Studenten eine erhohte Pravalenz und Auspragung von Personlichkeitsstorungen. Die Zahlen liegen etwa auf dem Niveau von Patienten eines stationaren Drogenentwohnungsprogramms. Weiterhin zeigen sich teilweise signifikante Zusammenhange zwischen der Auspragung einzelner Personlichkeitsstorungen und dem Schweregrad des Konsums von Ecstasy und anderen Drogen.\r\nEcstasykonsumenten fallen durch teilweise signifikant erhohte Werte insbesondere fur Personlichkeitsstorungen aus dem Cluster B auf, was konsistent ist mit anderen Studien, die bei Ecstasykonsumenten eine Pragnanz von Personlichkeitszugen gefunden haben, die den Cluster B Personlichkeitsstorungen zugrunde liegen. Diejenigen Ecstasykonsumenten, deren Gebrauchsmuster die ICD-10 Abhangigkeitskriterien erfullen, unterscheiden sich von den Kontrollen daruber hinaus durch eine starkere Belastung bei den Cluster C Personlichkeitsstorungen, was als Hinweis auf Probleme aus dem angstlich-dysphorischen Bereich gewertet wird. Dieses Ergebnis deckt sich mit Ergebnissen anderer Studien, die auf eine erhohte depressive Belastung von Ecstasykonsumenten hindeuten. \r\n\r\nDie Frage, inwieweit diese Ergebnisse durch vorbestehende Personlichkeitseigenschaften, mogliche neurotoxische Folgen des Ecstasykonsums, den Konsum anderer Drogen sowie durch methodische Schwierigkeiten insbesondere bei der Diagnostik von Personlichkeitsstorungen beeinflust worden sind, wird ausfuhrlich diskutiert. \r\n\r\nAls weiteres wichtiges Ergebnis dieser Studie ist die niedrige Pravalenz der antisozialen Personlichkeitsstorung zu nennen, die mit 9% in der Gesamtgruppe der Ecstasykonsumenten und 14% bei den Ecstasyabhangigen unter der Zahl liegt, die bei Alkohol-, Opiat- und Kokainabhangigen gefunden werden. Dieses Ergebnis ist wahrscheinlich auf verschiedene Faktoren wie eine grostenteils bessere soziale Integration von Ecstasykonsumenten, substanzspezifische Unterschiede sowie die mangelnde Validitat der antisozialen Personlichkeitsstorung zuruckzufuhren.\r\n\r\nZusammengefast weist diese Studie auf die wichtige Rolle von Personlichkeitsstorungen bei der Entwicklung von Misbrauch- und Abhangigkeitsmustern von Ecstasy hin. Fur die Zukunft ware es wunschenswert, diejenigen Konsumenten, bei denen Hinweise auf das Vorhandensein einer Personlichkeitsstorung vorliegen beispielsweise unter Verwendung semistrukturierter Interviews genauer zu betrachten. Daruber hinaus weist diese Studie auf die Unterschiede zu Abhangigen herkommlicher Drogen und die daraus folgende Notwendigkeit fur speziell auf Ecstasykonsumenten zugeschnittene Hilfsangebote hin.",

      "abstract": "Il presente lavoro analizza, nel quadro piu generale della ricerca sugli stili di vita e i comportamenti alimentari, alcuni aspetti in ordine a: uso del tempo libero, abitudine a bere alcolici e uso di tabacco, mettendoli in relazione con le tendenze di comportamento alimentare. Rispetto al primo tema, le attivita che risultano prevalenti sono quelle che non comportano attivita fisica, ed in modo particolare la visione della TV e l’ascolto della radio. Le uscite con amici riguardano invece il frequentare la discoteca e, in misura ancora maggiore, il bar e le sale giochi. Se l’esposizione ai media non risulta correlata con abitudini dannose o con tendenze alimentari non corrette, la frequenza dei luoghi di aggregazione indicati dai ragazzi risulta invece avere un incidenza sia con il consumo di alcool che con l’uso di tabacco. Entrambi questi comportamenti, inoltre, sembrano avere solo marginali collegamenti con la scarsa accettazione del proprio corpo e con l’impulso alla magrezza, ma sono invece comuni tra coloro che non si alimentano correttamente e che, piu in generale, hanno poca cura della propria salute. Il fumo risulta avere la connotazione, soprattutto per i piu giovani, di rituale di passaggio all’eta adulta. L’alcool, il cui consumo e piuttosto rilevante, risente sia della cultura familiare, nell’uso durante i pasti e comunque in casa, sia della cultura del gruppo dei pari. Con gli amici le bevande alcoliche vengono bevute in molte situazioni di vita quotidiana (gli spuntini, le soste al bar, la discoteca del fine settimana) e per denotare i momenti trasgressivi, come serate particolari, feste, vacanze senza la presenza degli adulti. L’intento di questo approfondimento e di delineare un quadro che permetta di ipotizzare ricerche-intervento successive, approntando piani di prevenzione e di promozione della salute basati sulla valutazione dei contesti territoriali e relazionali in cui si svolge la vita quotidiana dei ragazzi.",

      "abstract": "Embora a literatura científica sobre as consequências do consumo de tabaco nos jovens e nos adultos seja, hoje em dia, consideravelmente extensa, ela é bastante reduzida no que se refere a crianças e pré-adolescentes. O objectivo deste artigo era examinar a evolução do consumo de tabaco, desde a infância até ao fim da adolescência, devotando-se particular atenção aos efeitos negativos do consumo de tabaco de início precoce. Adicionalmente, serão também apresentadas e discutidas diversas informações sobre a prevalência do consumo de tabaco e seus padrões de desenvolvimento durante essas idades. Para tal utilizaram-se dados de um estudo longitudinal em que participou uma numerosa amostra de rapazes e raparigas da comunidade, que foi seguida desde os primeiros anos do ensino básico até ao fim da escola secundária. Os resultados mostraram que o consumo de tabaco, embora raro, já ocorria nos primeiros anos de escolaridade, aumentando progressivamente com a idade para se tornar um fenómeno muito frequente no fim da adolescência. Além disso, os fumadores apresentavam mais problemas em quase todos os domínios aqui analisados, designadamente comportamentos anti-sociais, consumo de droga, problemas emocionais, fraco desempenho escolar e diversas outras formas de psicopatologia. Mas a maioria dessas diferenças desaparecia, uma vez controlados os efeitos de outros problemas da infância (v.g. comportamento anti-social, problemas de atenção e hiperactividade). Também não se encontraram diferenças sistemáticas entre fumadores de início precoce e fumadores de início tardio. Concluindo, as crianças e adolescentes que fumam parecem correr maiores riscos de futuros problemas em vários domínios; todavia, em grande parte esses efeitos negativos podem ser explicados por outros factores da infância que, habitualmente, andam associados com o fumar de início precoce.",

      "title": "Nutritional problems in smokers and passive smokers",
      "abstract": "Objective: active or passive tobacco use affects a high percentage of individuals and is associated with various health risks. The aim of this review was to look more closely at the nutritional problems that are specific of smokers, which may harm their health. Methods: a bibliographic search related to the topic. Results: smokers consume lower amounts of various foods, especially fruits, vegetables, cereals and dairy. As a result, their intake of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals is lower than that observed in non-smokers. Their consumption of meat, caffeine and alcohol is usually higher, and their activity lower than those of non-smokers, coexisting in smokers unhealthy behaviors that contribute to harming their health and quality of life. Oxidative stress and metabolic changes render the needs for some nutrients higher in smokers to achieve the same biochemical situation as in non-smokers. Recommended intakes of vitamin C have increased, but it will probably be necessary to also increase the intakes of other nutrients. In general, smokers suffer from deficiencies more frequently (vitamins C, E, β-carotene, B1, B2, B12, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, iron, iodine, etc.) than non-smokers. Passive smokers are also affected in their eating habits and nutritional status. Conclusions: the worse nutritional status of smokers can contribute to the appearance/worsening of various diseases associated with smoking (cardiovascular, cancer, cataracts, osteoporosis, etc.); therefore, nutritional surveillance and correction of nutritional deficiencies could represents health benefits for smokers and passive smokers, which should be considered in the future.Objetivos: el consumo de tabaco, activo o pasivo, afecta a un elevado porcentaje de individuos y se asocia a diversos riesgos sanitarios. Profundizar en los problemas nutricionales específicos de los fumadores que pueden contribuir a perjudicar su salud constituye el objeto de la presente revisión. Métodos: búsqueda bibliográfica en relación con el tema. Resultados: los fumadores consumen cantidades inferiores de diversos alimentos, especialmente: frutas, verduras, cereales y lácteos. Como consecuencia, su ingesta de vitaminas, minerales y fitoquímicos es inferior a la observada en los no fumadores. Su consumo de carne, cafeína y alcohol suele ser superior y su actividad inferior a la de los no fumadores, coexistiendo en los fumadores conductas poco saludables que se potencian, perjudicando la salud y la calidad de vida del colectivo. El estrés oxidativo y los cambios metabólicos hacen que las necesidades de algunos nutrientes sean superiores en los fumadores para lograr la misma situación bioquímica que en los no fumadores. Las ingestas recomendadas de vitamina C se han incrementado, pero probablemente sea necesario aumentar las de otros nutrientes. En general, los fumadores sufren deficiencias con más frecuencia (vitaminas C, E, β-caroteno, B1, B2, B12, ácido fólico, calcio, magnesio, hierro, yodo, etc.) que los no fumadores. Los fumadores pasivos se ven afectados también en sus hábitos alimentarios y su situación nutricional. Conclusiones: la peor situación nutricional de los fumadores puede contribuir a la aparición/el empeoramiento de diversas patologías asociadas al hábito de fumar (cardiovasculares, cáncer, cataratas, osteoporosis, etc.), por lo que la vigilancia nutricional y la corrección de las deficiencias nutricionales podrían suponer un beneficio sanitario para los fumadores y fumadores pasivos que debe ser considerada en el futuro.",

      "title": "Cannabis use disorder and the lungs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Cannabis is one of the world's most widely used recreational drugs and the second most commonly smoked substance. Research on cannabis and the lungs has been limited by its illegal status, the variability in strength and size of cannabis cigarettes (joints), and the fact that most cannabis users also smoke tobacco, making the effects difficult to separate. Despite these difficulties, the available evidence indicates that smoking cannabis causes bronchitis and is associated with changes in lung function. The pattern of effects is surprisingly different from that of tobacco. Whereas smoking cannabis appears to increase the risk of severe bronchitis at quite low exposure, there is no convincing evidence that this leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Instead, cannabis use is associated with increased central airway resistance, lung hyperinflation and higher vital capacity with little evidence of airflow obstruction or impairment of gas transfer. There are numerous reports of severe bullous lung disease and pneumothorax among heavy cannabis users, but convincing epidemiological data of an increased risk of emphysema or alveolar destruction are lacking. An association between cannabis and lung cancer remains unproven, with studies providing conflicting findings.",

      "abstract": "La guida di un autoveicolo, specie in condizioni di intenso traffico o di cattive condizioni meteoclimatiche, e considerata uno dei principali fattori stressanti della vita odierna. Durante la guida si possono infatti osservare significative risposte simpatoadrenergiche e cardiovascolari con la comparsa anche di episodi coronarici. Tali risposte presentano un’ampia variabilita interindividuale in quanto sono influenzate da vari fattori (stile di vita, personalita etc.). In questa rassegna, vengono presentati i principali risultati degli studi da noi condotti sulle risposte psicofisiologiche indotte dalla guida di diversi tipi di autoveicoli. In conducenti di autobus urbani e stato registrato un sensibile aumento del tasso urinario di adrenalina durante il turno lavorativo rispetto alla stessa fascia oraria di un giorno di riposo. Tale risposta adrenergica era esaltata dall’abitudine tabagica e dall’assunzione di caffe e bevande alcoliche. In soggetti che alla guida di camion coprono lunghe distanze, i piu elevati tassi urinari di catecolamine e i piu alti livelli di frequenza cardiaca sono stati registrati quando la guida era particolarmente stressante per la presenza di nebbia o di intenso traffico. In soggetti che partecipano, a livello amatoriale, a manifestazioni agonistiche di velocita su pista, abbiamo osservato che durante la gara, rispetto al periodo pre-gara, l’escrezione urinaria di catecolamine aumenta in misura molto rilevante. Analogamente a quanto osservato in autisti di camion, l’attivazione del sistema adrenergico e risultata direttamente associata ai livelli di ansieta. Dall’elettrocardiogramma dinamico e emerso che durante la gara la frequenza cardiaca raggiunge un valore medio di 163.5±7.4 battiti/min. (range: 146,180 battiti/min.). Un significativo peggioramento della percezione visiva stereoscopica, con potenziale ricaduta negativa sulla performance dei guidatori, e stato osservato in studenti universitari esposti per 5 ore al complesso dei fattori stressanti propri dell’ambiente della discoteca. In un recente studio condotto su autisti di autocarri abbiamo altresi osservato, al termine del turno di guida, un rilevante incremento del trombossano urinario che potrebbe rappresentare un marcatore di rischio cardiovascolare.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes for tobacco cessation",
      "abstract": "NPs practicing in primary care frequently encounter patients who use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), some for the purpose of tobacco cessation. Research shows that clinician involvement in tobacco cessation increases the likelihood of success, and the desire to quit appears to be the strongest predictive factor for successful cessation.1,2 Patients seeking evidence-based assistance regarding tobacco cessation, such as nicotine replacement or cessation medication, are two to three times more likely to quit than those who do not.3 Despite the common belief that ENDS products, which include e-cigarettes, tank systems, and other vaping devices, are suitable for tobacco cessation, they are not recommended for this purpose because of health risks and lack of FDA approval, among other reasons. NPs can positively impact their patients' ability to achieve cessation from smoking and other tobacco products without the use of ENDS, and many resources are available to aid them in this process. It has been known since at least 1988 that nicotine is the addictive substance in tobacco.4 Nicotine reaches the brain within seconds of taking a puff and increases the release of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, that regulate mood and behavior.5 Dopamine is released in the reward center of the brain, resulting in improved mood and pleasant feelings. Over time, neuronal changes occur; thus, nicotine addiction is a chronic neurologic disorder frequently requiring treatment to overcome.6 When ENDS were introduced, it was speculated that the devices could be a powerful tool for tobacco cessation by providing a safer alternative to cigarettes, with the allure of a smoking-like behavior replacement. The liquid used with ENDS, sometimes referred to as e-liquid, produces a harmful aerosol when heated that is inhaled by users and involuntarily inhaled by nonusers.3,7,8 E-liquids usually contain nicotine, and more than half of the people who start using ENDS for tobacco cessation transfer their nicotine dependence to ENDS, often becoming dual users.3,9,10 ENDS use among adolescents is associated with increased initiation of cigarette smoking and increased frequency and intensity of both regular cigarette and e-cigarette usage.11 ENDS product use among adolescents leads to increased dependence on nicotine products.10 After years of market availability, three separate clinical guidelines recommend against the use of ENDs for tobacco cessation because of quality control concerns, insufficient data to demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the risks, and the availability of effective cessation tools. This article examines why ENDS products are not an effective, safe, or approved means of cessation for either adults or adolescents. ENDS products Youth cigarette usage has been steadily declining in recent years, but tobacco use rates remain stubbornly fixed at approximately 20% because noncigarette forms of tobacco, primarily ENDs, are increasingly used by adolescents and young adults.12 In 2020, 19.6% of high-school students in the US reported using ENDS, along with 4.7% of middle-school students.12,13 With 8.2% and 2.8% of high-school and middle-school students, respectively, reporting use of multiple tobacco products, it is clear that many youth are becoming addicted to nicotine by starting with ENDS use alone.13 Nonetheless, polytobacco use (using more than one tobacco product) is increasingly common as the market popularity of ENDS products has increased. Polytobacco users are more likely to report dependence, elucidated as early-morning cravings.12 Notably, attempts to quit among polytobacco users have been higher than cigarette-only users, suggesting that e-cigarette users are employing e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.14 The FDA regulates ENDS.15 However, ENDS products are not FDA-approved for smoking cessation. There are several FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) for this purpose, including three that are available over the counter (nicotine patches [Nicoderm CQ, Habitrol, and generic versions], nicotine lozenges [Nicorette and generic versions], and nicotine gum [Nicorette and generic versions]), and four by prescription, including two nonnicotine oral drugs (bupropion [Zyban] and varenicline [Chantix]), a nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS), and nicotine inhalers (Nicotrol). Nicotine replacement dosage calculation is based on the patient's specific nicotine consumption, such as the number of cigarettes smoked and/or time to first morning cigarette, to ensure minimal withdrawal during the cessation process. Thus, there are ample well-tested FDA-approved products available for cessation. Quality control concerns At this time, there is no legally required quality control of ENDS products; therefore, these products are manufactured without FDA oversight of quality, according to D. Jenson, Lead Senior Staff Attorney for Federal Regulation, Public Health Law Center, Mitchell Hamline School of Law (e-mail communication, December 18, 2020). Three important quality control issues are highlighted, including inaccuracy of nicotine content, compounding-in-shop (CIS) processes of e-liquids, and FDA involvement. Inaccurate nicotine content. The American E-Liquid Manufacturing Standards Association (AEMSA) states that the nicotine content of all products containing e-liquids must be within 10% of the labeled amount.16 Almost half of the studies in a systematic review of e-liquid nicotine content found inaccurate nicotine labeling of ENDS products, with some samples varying more than 100% from the label.17-21 - ENDS use-associated risks ENDS factors compromising cessation efforts Lack of proven tobacco cessation efficacy Inability to accurately dose nicotine for tobacco cessation (risk of nicotine withdrawal and/or nicotine-related adverse reactions) Lack of quality control oversight Inaccurate nicotine content Inconsistencies of in-shop compounding and labeling Direct risks of ENDS use Youth exposure to nicotine Unknown safety of inhaling e-liquid additives Risk of acute e-liquid nicotine poisoning E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury Device battery fires/explosions The authors' 2019 study supports these findings, with only 3.8% of the 238 e-liquid samples meeting AEMSA guidelines.18,22 This cross-sectional study replicated and expanded on the authors' 2015 study assessing free-base, nicotine salt (salt), and 0-mg nicotine e-liquids from a variety of North Dakota shop types to determine nicotine content accuracy.22 The authors also examined the nicotine content of CIS samples. The CIS definition was adapted from Ribisl and colleagues and was specified as either an e-liquid made entirely on site or a premade liquid to which the shop staff added extra nicotine.23 Discrete data collection was completed in 35 (92.1%) of the shops meeting the criteria. Shop types were categorized as vape shops (n = 16, 45.7%), head shops with vaping products (n = 10, 28.6%), tobacco shops (n = 6, 17.1%), and other shops (n = 3, 8.6%). This study used discreet sampling methods so as to not alter the behavior of people in public places, such as the manager, workers, and patrons; therefore, data collectors acted as normal paying customers. Of the e-liquids (n = 285) purchased, 164 (57.5%) were free-base, 80 (28.1%) were salts, and 41 (14.4%) were identified as not containing any nicotine. The mean actual nicotine content was 34% below the labeled content, ranging from 93% below to 213% above the indicated content.22 None of the 25 CIS samples met the AEMSA guideline. In one shop, six samples were not labeled for nicotine content. When asked, the shop staff stated that all six contained the same nicotine content. However, the actual content ranged from just under 6 mg/mL to almost 20 mg/mL. CIS processes. CIS processes were observed during our 2019 study.22 CIS ingredients included nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. Vape shop staff used imprecise methods in compounding e-liquids, including visually estimating quantities of ingredients added. In one-third (two of six) of the shops where CIS processes were observed, shop staff did not relabel the nicotine content of the liquids. In one case, the nicotine content was increased from 0 mg/mL to 12 mg/mL without relabeling the bottle. Other labeling concerns included e-liquids sold without any labels, past their labeled expiration dates, and without an ingredient list.24 Another unprofessional practice included one shop being adjacent to a fish breeding room. Because of the inconsistencies in compounding and labeling, users cannot assume accuracy of e-liquid nicotine content. This has implications for individuals who are using e-liquids for cessation. Exposure to higher nicotine levels increases addiction risk. E-liquids with nicotine content lower than labeled may cause withdrawal symptoms. These are not concerns when using FDA-approved cessation products under the care of an NP. FDA involvement. The FDA requires ENDS manufacturers to file a premarket application; it is illegal to market these products without premarket authorization.25 However, most ENDS products have not been authorized by the FDA. It is of concern that given the overwhelming number of products available, the FDA states that they are unable \"to take enforcement action against every illegally marketed tobacco product.\"25 The FDA does not perform quality testing of e-cigarettes (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). Additionally, if there are no drug claims (such as for tobacco cessation), then there are neither specific quality standards or regulations for the manufacturing processes of e-cigarettes, nor for the end product (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). No e-cigarette or similar product has been approved as a drug product; therefore, no e-cigarettes are affected by the requirements that apply to FDA-regulated drugs (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). Concerns related to using e-liquids and ENDS for quitting tobacco use E-cigarette use is a particularly compelling nicotine option for cigarette users because it mimics both the physiologic satisfaction of a nicotine craving as well as the psychologic satisfaction of the act of smoking and responding to external cues that lead to smoking (time of day, social situations, behavioral triggers). The sensory and physical stimuli associated with cigarette smoking are deeply embedded aspects of smoking enjoyment and dependence (hand-to-mouth action, deep inhale/exhale, visual cues, throat hit, and tobacco flavor). The close imitation to cigarette smoking is one reason that cigarette users struggle with e-cigarette cessation, even when their original intention is to use e-cigarettes to stop all tobacco use.26 ENDS have been found to carry several health risks (see ENDS use-associated risks). Perhaps most concerning is the finding of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) that emerged in 2019.27 EVALI is an acute pulmonary illness that has been associated with ENDS use, which can be severe and life-threatening, and is characterized by bilateral infiltrates on radiologic imaging.27 It has been shown that the e-liquid additive vitamin E acetate is strongly linked to EVALI.28 Additional ENDS-related health risks include the lack of safety data associated with inhaling many of the e-liquid additives, defective device batteries causing fires and explosions, and acute nicotine poisoning related to ingestion, inhalation, and topical absorption of e-liquids.29 Clinical guidelines relating to ENDS Nicotine users often ask whether ENDS are safe and effective and whether they can be used for cessation from traditional tobacco products. Many worldwide studies have attempted to answer that question. However, NPs and other clinicians face difficulties when interpreting such studies. First, ENDS products are not actively regulated; specific product analysis included in one study cannot be generalized to other products because of differences in the ENDS product devices as well as the liquid ingredients. Secondly, as mentioned, research shows that the actual nicotine content in ENDS products can vary, sometimes significantly, from their label.17,22 Finally, the puff patterns of ENDS users (how much of and how fast each puff is inhaled) are often not standardized in clinical trials, leading to wide variability of ENDS use, making comparisons difficult. Some clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have tried to summarize all the studies to determine whether NPs can recommend ENDS products for tobacco cessation, which are described below. In 2018, the American College of Cardiology's Decision Pathway on tobacco cessation treatment recommended that \"given the uncertainties of the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on health, a clinician should advise cigarette smokers seeking to quit to use evidence-based, FDA-approved, safe, and effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies as first-line treatments in preference to e-cigarettes.\"30 However, the document notes that some patients will choose to use ENDS products even if FDA-approved treatments are recommended. In those cases, the clinician should support the patient's effort to modify tobacco use and recommend use of ENDS products in the safest way possible (for example, avoid dual use of ENDS and cigarettes, ensure child-proof packaging and avoid using around children, and follow device instructions to minimize risk of explosion), with the goal of quitting both tobacco and ENDS products. In 2020, the American Thoracic Society's CPG for medication treatment in adults who use tobacco recommended that varenicline is a preferred treatment option over ENDS products.31 Studies evaluated in this CPG comparing varenicline with ENDS products showed that the benefit of varenicline over ENDS was uncertain; however, varenicline had fewer adverse reactions than ENDS products. Additional studies comparing varenicline with ENDS are needed to increase confidence in the recommendation. In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) stated that \"evidence on the use of e-cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons, is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.\"32 The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct nonpregnant patients to FDA-approved pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation.32 Clinicians are advised to direct pregnant persons to behavioral interventions. NPs should be aware of the many risks associated with ENDS products as well as the lack of evidence supporting the use of ENDS as a cessation method. Avoidance of ENDS products should be recommended; however, when that is not possible, approaching ENDS products in the same manner as other tobacco products would support patients' attempts to achieve both tobacco cessation and ENDS abstinence. Conclusion The science is still developing on the short- and long-term effects of ENDS on health and tobacco cessation efforts. Quality control of ENDS products is lacking. The actual nicotine content in ENDS products is often unknown, making it difficult to calculate the risk of replacing cigarettes with ENDS while ensuring equivalent levels of nicotine. Conversely, FDA-approved treatment medications are safe, effective, and have well-established dosing aimed at minimizing nicotine withdrawal and maximizing cessation success. Currently, there are no healthcare provider guidelines that recommend ENDS as a safe or effective means for cessation. The authors concur with current science-based guidelines that ENDS use for tobacco cessation is not recommended. NPs can instead recommend the cessation products approved by the FDA.",

In tobacco smoke, nicotine and other dangerous substances have detrimental influence not only for smokers but for the \"passive smokers\" whom very often are children. Cigarette smoke causes unfavorable skin changes or intensifies course of many skin diseases including cancer. Tobacco smoke additionally quickens the natural process of skin aging. It has been observed that the skin of smoking addicts at the age of 40 years resembles skin of non-smoking 70 year old adults. Skin damage due to tobacco smoke is irreversible, where further damage can be avoided by stopping smoking. Present trends try to find ways to stop or at least delay changes caused by aging.

En febrero de 2001, la Direccion General de Salud y Proteccion del Consumidor de la Comision Europea, a traves del Comite Cientifico de Alimentacion Humana (CCAH), redacto un informe sobre la composicion de los alimentos y las bebidas destinadas a cubrir el gasto energetico en un gran esfuerzo muscular, especialmente en los deportistas. En este documento se indica que los alimentos y liquidos especialmente adaptados ayudan a solucionar problemas especificos para que se pueda alcanzar un balance nutricional optimo. Estos efectos beneficiosos no estan limitados solo a deportistas que realizan un ejercicio muscular regular e intenso, sino tambien a aquellas personas que por sus trabajos hacen esfuerzos importantes o en condiciones adversas. El 15 de junio de 2016, la Comision Europea presento al Parlamento Europeo y al Consejo un informe sobre alimentos destinados a los deportistas. En este informe se concluye que no hay necesidad de disposiciones especificas en los alimentos para deportistas. A partir del 20 de julio de 2016 estos productos deben cumplir las normas horizontales pertinentes de la legislacion alimentaria de la UE.",

Substance abuse is usually defined as the misuse of drugs, including taking a drug for purposes other than those prescribed or intended. Dependent or addicted individuals engage in compulsive drug seeking and drug taking despite the consequences to self and others. A recent national survey (in the US) on drug abuse estimated 16.6 million individuals classified as substance abuser and/or dependent, with 1.1 million seeking treatment for substance abuse disorders. Both conditions are recognized for their deleterious consequences to individuals as well as society. Therefore, the primary goal of clinicians is to optimize therapies for maladaptive drug-taking behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Because of recent resurgence in its consumption, the effects and health consequences of smokeless tobacco are of considerable public health interest. We studied the extent and time course of absorption of nicotine and cardiovascular effects of smokeless tobacco (oral snuff and chewing tobacco) and compared it with smoking cigarettes and chewing nicotine gum in 10 healthy volunteers. Maximum levels of nicotine were similar but, because of prolonged absorption, overall nicotine exposure was twice as large after single exposures to smokeless tobacco compared with cigarette smoking. All tobacco use increased heart rate and blood pressure, with a tendency toward a greater overall cardiovascular effect despite evidence of development of some tolerance to effects of nicotine with use of smokeless tobacco. Relatively low levels of nicotine and lesser cardiovascular responses were observed with use of nicotine gum. Adverse health consequences of smoking that are nicotine related would be expected to present a similar hazard with the use of smokeless tobacco.

      "title": "Update in pediatrics: to take or not to take soft drinks, sports or energy drinks?",
      "abstract": "The world of beverages is a large and growing industry, but we have to look skeptically even if they are called soft drinks, sports or energy drinks.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the recent studies regarding the types of beverages mentioned above sustain the negative effect of these on health from sodas to energy drinks (1). The most concerning fact is that in US, for example, the consume of energy drinks in adolescents and young adults is 30 to 50% and this leads to a high percentage of caffeine intoxication in this population (46% under 19 years in 2007 in US) (2).\r\n\r\nThere are specific differences between these products. A soft drink also called soda or carbonated beverage typically contains carbonated water, a sweetener and a flavoring agent. These may also contain caffeine or fruit juice. The best known in our country are Coca/Pepsi Cola, Fanta (orange) and sparkling lemonade. Sports drinks are some flavored beverages containing carbohydrates, minerals, electrolytes (e.g. sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium), and vitamins (sometimes). Their purpose is to rehydrate the body and replace the electrolytes after intense sweating during exercise (Gatorade, Powerade). Different from these are the energy drinks which besides carbohydrates, minerals, electrolytes and aminoacids, typically contain stimulants such as caffeine and guarana, also taurine, ginseng, L-carnitine, creatine, and/or glucuronolactone. The purpose of the energy drinks is to stimulate the body (Red Bull, Burn, etc).\r\n\r\nA recent statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (1) from the COMMITTEE ON NUTRITION AND THE COUNCIL ON SPORTS MEDICINE AND FITNESS sustains that all these beverages are dangerous for children. The spo­rts drinks should be admitted only for those athletes with sustained physical activity, but the energy drinks should not be admitted in children, adolescents and young adults.\r\n\r\nThe most important issues of these beverages are the content and the changes over the body they induce.\r\n\r\nThe content of carbohydrates increases the risk for obesity (3), dental cavities (4) due to acidic pH, low nutrient levels and in adults the risk for arterial hypertension (5) and type II diabetes. The excess content of carbohydrates of these beverages is imbalanced regarding the proteins, fat and other nutrients.\r\n\r\nThe caloric content of soft drinks is 10 to 100 calories per serving, sports drinks is 10 to 70 calories per serving, and of energy drinks ranges from 10 to 270 calories per serving. This excessive caloric content is not necessary and these beverages should be replaced with water or low fat milk (1).\r\n\r\nThe caffeine effect in children and adolescents is proven to be negative (1) including effects on the developing neurological and cardiovascular systems and the risk of physical dependence and addiction. The parents and children should be attentive to the cumulated doses of caffeine contained in sodas, e.g. soda contains 24-50 mg/per serving (240 ml), a cup of coffee 75-150 mg, energy drinks 500 mg/per serving. A lethal dose of caffeine is considered to be 200 to 400 mg/kg (1). One gram of guarana is equal to approximately 40 mg of caffeine (1).\r\n\r\nThe COMMITTEE ON NUTRITION AND THE COUNCIL ON SPORTS MEDICINE AND FITNESS encourages pediatricians to explain to children and adolescents and their parents the differences between beverages, to avoid the energy and sports drinks, for mentioned consequences, to educate patients and families to consume sports drinks only for specific limited reasons in child and adolescent athletes, and to encourage the consumption of water for hydration.",

But even though the use of tobacco is primarily motivated by an expectation of “Genuss,” within recent years the main public focus has turned to the problematic aspects of smoking. In the years after World War II concerns were directed toward the harms of tobacco. Then – starting in the 1980s – the discourse on harm changed into a discourse on (nicotine) addiction. This article outlines a prospective research project concerned with the way the addiction discourse continuously reproduces current patterns of “addicted smoking” in the form of a self-fulfilling prophecy.",

      "title": "Electronic Cigarettes and Oral Health",
      "abstract": "Novel nicotine products, particularly electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), have become increasingly popular over the past decade. E-cigarettes are sometimes regarded as a less harmful alternative to tobacco smoking, and there is some evidence of their potential role as a smoking cessation aid. However, there are concerns about their health consequences, particularly in users who are not tobacco smokers, and also when used long term. Given the mode of delivery of these products, there is potential for oral health consequences. Over the past few years, there have been an increasing number of studies conducted to explore their oral health effects. In vitro studies have reported a range of cellular effects, but these are much less pronounced than those resulting from exposure to tobacco smoke. Microbiological studies have indicated that e-cigarette users have a distinct microbiome, and there is some indication this may be more pathogenic compared to nonusers. Evidence of oral health effects from clinical trials is still limited, and most studies to date have been small in scale and usually cross-sectional in design. Epidemiological studies highlight concerns over oral dryness, irritation, and gingival diseases. Interpreting data from e-cigarette studies is challenging, given the different populations that have been investigated and the continual emergence of new products. Overall, studies reveal potential oral health harms, underscoring the importance of efforts to reduce use in nonsmokers. However, in smokers who are using e-cigarettes as an aid to help them quit, the benefits of quitting tobacco smoking may outweigh any negative oral health impacts of e-cigarette use, particularly in the short term. Future research is needed to understand the clinical significance of some of the biological changes observed by following different cohorts of users longitudinally in carefully designed clinical studies and pragmatic trials supported by high-quality in vitro studies.",

Se ha producido en la sociedad occidental en pocos anos una introduccion masiva del habito y de la dependencia del consumo de tabaco, en especial si se compara con el uso que se habia venido haciendo de otras sustancias a lo largo de la historia. En la actualidad, despues de muchos anos de permisividad del consumo de tabaco, estamos asistiendo a un cambio en la mentalidad social con respecto al propio consumo; se avanza hacia posiciones mas intolerantes respecto al mismo y se subrayan, de forma significativa. los derechos de los no consumidores. En el presente volumen diversos especialistas nos presentan los fundamentos biologicos, psicologicos y sociales relacionados con la dependencia tabaquica. Se hace un enfasis especial en los aspectos terapeuticos desde perspectivas farmacologicas, psicologicas y economicas.",

      "abstract": "The increase in substance use which occurred in the 1980s was disproportionately large among women of reproductive age, so both the numbers of women who use drugs and the duration of drug use have increased (Hepburn 2004). While drug use occurs throughout society, the type and pattern of drug use that is associated with medical and social problems is closely associated with socio-economic deprivation. Socio-economic deprivation is in turn associated with unhealthy lifestyles and behaviours such as smoking and poor diet. Deprivation, associated lifestyles and substance use adversely affect the health of mother and baby, so the effects are cumulative. Consequently women with problem drug and/or alcohol use have potentially complex pregnancies (Hepburn 2004).",

O consumo de tabaco induz dependencia fisica e psicologica na grande maioria dos consumidores, constituindo, actualmente, a primeira causa de morbilidade e de mortalidade evitaveis, afectando todo o organismo humano. Existe hoje suficiente evidencia de que o consumo de tabaco e factor causal de cancro em diferentes localizacoes, de doencas respiratorias cronicas e de doencas cardiovasculares, para alem de outros efeitos no aparelho gastrointestinal, na saude reprodutiva, no sistema endocrino, na saude ocular, na saude ossea e no envelhecimento da pele. O consumo de tabaco esta tambem associado aos problemas de saude mental. Os fumadores apresentam piores indicadores de saude do que os nao fumadores e uma esperanca de vida menor. Cerca de metade dos fumadores regulares morre em resultado do consumo de tabaco, um quarto dos quais nas idades compreendidas entre os 25 e os 69 anos. O consumo de tabaco e um factor de risco totalmente evitavel. Parar de fumar reduz os riscos associados ao consumo e a mortalidade prematura. Parar de fumar tem beneficios em qualquer idade, tanto maiores quanto mais cedo se verificar o abandono do tabaco. A dependencia do tabaco deve, assim, ser encarada pelos profissionais de saude, em particular pelos medicos, como uma doenca cronica, recidivante, que carece de prevencao e de tratamento.",

      "abstract": "and hydrogen cyanide) and numerous polycyclic hydrocarbons, at least one of which is a known carcinogen Why so many of us get pleasure from partaking of such a mixture is something of a mystery. The chemical analysis of tobacco smoke, while suggestive, does not in itself prove anything about the long-term effects of smoking. Some chemicals which are highly toxic in large doses are harmless or even beneficial in small doses. Other substances may be practically harmless in a single large dose but cause serious damage after pro longed exposure to relatively small doses. Furthermore, there are some factors which seem to have little or no effect on healthy individuals but which have deleterious effects on patients suffering from certain diseases. As scientists, I think we would all agree that the ideal way to determine the long-term effects of smoking would be to set up a well-controlled experiment on human beings. It should start when the subjects are in their teens and continue until the last one dies of old age. Unfortunately, this is a bit impractical for numerous reasons. For example, it would be quite impossible for the investigator to maintain the same degree of control over human subjects as over laboratory animals. For these reasons, many studies have been made to ascertain what happens to people who of their own volition have smoked for many years. Perhaps the least satisfactory has been the study of time trend associations. As shown on Figure 1, a tremendous increase has occurred in the reported death rate from lung cancer. In this country, the age standardized rate for white males rose from about 0.7 per 100,000 in 1914 to 28.4 per 100,000 in 1956. This led to the hypothesis that a corresponding increase must have occurred in one or more factors responsible for lung cancer, probably some substance inhaled into the lungs. Concurrently, a decrease occurred in three other lung diseases: tuberculosis, influenza, and pneumonia. Coal soot, dust from asphalt highways, motor vehicle exhaust fumes, fumes from fuel oil, and cigarette smoke have been suspect in relation",

Nicotine is the main psychoactive drug responsible for the addictive nature of tobacco, explaining why many smokers fail to quit without assistance. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is deemed effective for a broad range of populations and should be routinely offered to smokers interested in making a quit attempt. Varenicline, a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic receptor increases chances of quitting three-fold compared to placebo in smokers without comorbidities, and in smokers with cardiovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Persons with mental illness have high rates of smoking, and the potential impact of varenicline on mental status and the underlying pathophysiology of mental illness, has become a salient concern. Varenicline is an appropriate aid for smoking cessation in patients with medical and/or psychiatric comorbidity.

Os resultados mostram que os jovens entre 18 e 24 anos têm as taxas mais elevadas de consumo de cigarros eletrônicos. Além disso, o uso desses dispositivos pode levar a danos nos tecidos pulmonares, resultando em sintomas graves, como insuficiência respiratória. Portanto, é necessária a regulamentação eficaz dos cigarros eletrônicos para evitar o uso indiscriminado, especialmente entre os jovens.

Ten of the 16 had a previous substance abuse disorder (most commonly alcohol), two had a psychiatric diagnosis, and 14 of 16 were of the same sex. In addition, although subjects were not assessed for nicotine dependence, five were smokers who had a higher caffeine consumption than the nonsmokers. Obviously, caffeine consumption is markedly different from the use of drugs of abuse. For example, steadily increasing doses are generally not associated with caffeine ingestion and, of course, the destructive antisocial behavior provoked by drugs of abuse is clearly not associated with caffeine",

Body water content drops and fat content increases so, because alcohol is more soluble in water, older people tend to have higher blood alcohol concentration for any given dose. There is also evidence that ageing impairs the body’s ability to deal with alcohol. Despite this, moderate alcohol has been found to have a protective effect for the cardiovascular system. This study examined levels of cognitive function, subjective well- being and depressive symptoms associated with different levels of alcohol consumption. The authors found significant positive effects on recall and numerical reasoning, improved subjective well-being and fewer depressive symptoms in older people who consume moderate (up to two drinks a day) levels of alcohol when compared with people who have never taken or have given up alcohol.",

The consumption of other drugs is very marginal and most of health harms induced is due to problematic consumption of opiate drugs and cocaine.",

While there is evidence to suggest a high prevalence of risky drinking among users of ATS in Australia, little is known about how they combine their use of ATS with the consumption of alcohol or why they do so. This paper considers how ATS users consume alcohol during ecstasy and methamphetamine use, and also addresses alcohol abuse and dependence among low-risk and at-risk ATS users. At-risk users are more likely to have experienced alcohol abuse and dependence during adolescence or early adulthood, suggesting that higher-risk use of ATS may be linked with problematic drinking patterns. The paper suggests that problematic behaviour relating to alcohol and ATS use is interlinked, and may be important in developing appropriate policy responses.",

Smoking and tobacco use begin during early adolescence, and most smokers try their first cigarette by age 12. A variety of psychosocial factors are involved in the initiation of tobacco use by adolescents. Strategies to prevent tobacco use should address these factors. Cessation efforts are hampered by nicotine addiction, which occurs in adolescents in a manner comparable to adults. Physicians and health care providers can assist adolescents in their attempts to quit tobacco use. A combination of counseling, peer and family support and, for some, nicotine replacement therapy, is the best approach to tobacco cessation. This paper reviews the findings of the major epidemiologic surveys of adolescent tobacco use and suggests strategies that health care providers can employ to reduce tobacco use among their adolescent patients.",

      "abstract": "Following DIY (do it yourself) diets as well as consuming supplements exceeding by far the recommended daily intake levels, is common among athletes; these dietary habits often lead to an overconsumption of some macro and/or micronutrients, exposing athletes to potential health risks. The aim of this study is to document the development of possible adverse effects in a 33 year-old amateur bodybuilder who consumed for 16 years a DIY high protein diet associated to nutrient supplementation. Body composition, biochemical measures and anamnestic findings were evaluated. We present this case to put on alert about the possible risks of such behavior repeated over time, focusing on the adverse gastrointestinal effects. We discuss the energy and nutrient composition of his DIY diet as well as the use of supplements.",

      "title": "Weight Loss Strategies for Adolescents",
      "abstract": "With prevalence approaching 20% in the United States, adolescent obesity has become a common problem for patients, parents, and clinicians. Obese adolescents may experience physical and psychosocial complications, as illustrated by the case of Ms K, a 14-year-old girl with a body mass index of 40. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of pediatric obesity treatment is modest in younger children and declines in older children and adolescents, and few interventions involving adolescents have produced significant long-term weight loss. Nevertheless, novel strategies to alter energy balance have shown preliminary evidence of benefit in clinical trials, including a diet focused on food quality rather than fat restriction and a lifestyle approach to encourage enjoyable physical activity throughout the day rather than intermittent exercise. Parents can have an important influence on weight-related behaviors in adolescents despite typically complicated emotional dynamics at this age, especially through the use of noncoercive methods. A key parenting practice applicable to children of all ages is to create a protective environment in the home, substituting nutritious foods for unhealthful ones and facilitating physical activities instead of sedentary pursuits. Other behaviors that may promote successful long-term weight management include good sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and mindfulness. Ultimately, the obesity epidemic can be attributed to changes in the social environment that hinder healthful lifestyle habits, and prevention will require a comprehensive public health strategy.",

      "abstract": "O alcoolismo e uma doenca que afeta o sistema nervoso central, produzindo uma sensacao de prazer, que se da atraves do consumo excessivo de bebidas alcoolicas, de modo que interfira na vida de uma pessoa, provocando mudanca de comportamento e dependencia de quem o consome. Em se tratando da diferenca entre os sexos, os efeitos do alcool sao mais rapidos no sexo feminino, visto a maior proporcao de tecido gorduroso, por variacoes no decorrer do ciclo menstrual e por diferencas na concentracao gastrica do metabolismo do alcool. Uma das possiveis formas de analisar o enfrentamento da dependencia de alcool se da atraves do conceito de resiliencia de um individuo, compreendida como sendo a habilidade de um individuo para se recuperar das adversidades e se adaptar positivamente em situacoes de tensao e estresse. O uso excessivo de alcool pode afetar, ainda, a qualidade de vida do ser humano, seja individual ou social, causando doencas, no figado, estomago e/ou depressao, problemas no trabalho, de cunho legal ou algum episodio de violencia. O presente estudo tem por objetivo analisar a resiliencia e a qualidade de vida de mulheres que fazem uso excessivo de alcool em Joao Pessoa – PB. A dificuldade em encontrar uma amostra com caracteristicas tao peculiares, faz desta populacao, rara ou de dificil acesso. Como alternativa para estudar esse tipo de populacao o Respondent Driven Sampling (amostragem dirigida ao participante) se mostrou eficiente, pois utiliza como forma de recrutamento a possibilidade de calcular a probabilidade de selecao de um individuo indicado aderir a pesquisa. E importante ressaltar a dificuldade na realizacao do metodo visto a ideia de estimulos financeiros ou bonificacoes que nao e permitida pelos comites de etica brasileiros. O metodo permitiu analisar informacoes de 36 mulheres. Destas, 9 eram sementes que buscavam apoio no no CAPSad III, Centro POP e Ruartes. Todas consumiam o alcool em combinacao com outras drogas, especialmente a maconha e o cigarro. Com o AUDIT foi possivel observar que as mulheres necessitavam de avaliacao diagnostica e tratamento, visto que 80,6% estavam na zona de risco 4. O WHOQOL-bref evidenciou a baixa qualidade de vida dessas mulheres, principalmente no que se refere ao meio ambiente. O CD-RISC10 atenta para o baixo nivel de resiliencia. E importante ressaltar que ao analisar o nivel de resiliencia em relacao as zonas de risco do AUDIT observou-se que as mulheres que estao na zona 4 possuem, em sua maioria, resiliencia intermediaria a baixa. Os resultados evidenciaram que resiliencia esta associada a religiao, ao uso de crack, antidepressivos e cigarro, e pelos dominios 1(Fisico), 2 (Psicologico) e 4 (Meio ambiente) de qualidade de vida. Com o presente estudo foi possivel observar a magnitude dos problemas advindos do uso excessivo de alcool para mostrar a importância de apresentar a sociedade o quao complexa e essa problematica, de modo que possamos expor ao governo como auxilia-los a tomar as decisoes cabiveis para apoiar, nao apenas as mulheres, mas todos os que precisam de ajuda para tratar o vicio do alcool.",

No entanto, evidências científicas indicam que os impactos do cigarro podem persistir por anos ou até décadas após a interrupção do hábito, afetando a função pulmonar, cardiovascular, cognitiva e aumentando o risco de certos tipos de câncer. Esta revisão qualitativa analisou estudos recentes sobre os efeitos remanescentes do tabagismo em ex-fumantes de longa data. Os resultados demonstram que, embora os benefícios da cessação sejam evidentes, determinados prejuízos podem permanecer por mais de 20 anos, dependendo da doença analisada. Esses achados reforçam a necessidade de acompanhamento médico contínuo e políticas públicas que incentivem a cessação precoce do tabagismo.",

      "title": "The ‘Not-a-Puff’ rule",
      "abstract": "The ‘not-a-puff’ rule involves assisting smokers to stop smoking abruptly, commit to not smoking any further cigarettes after the quit date and also to promise to not taking even a single puff on a cigarette from that day forwards. This briefing provides the rationale and the theoretical and empirical evidence behind this clinical intervention. The traditional definition of a four-week quit used for stop smoking service returns to the Department of Health is ‘continuous abstinence from smoking from day 14 to the four-week follow-up point’. This means that occasional smoking is permitted in the first two weeks of the quit attempt but should NOT be interpreted clinically that this is a strategy that is encouraged. Better long-term results are obtained from abrupt cessation and adoption of the ‘not-a-puff’ rule. Continued smoking following the quit date prevents resolution of the neuroadaptive changes in the brain that take place upon quitting and leads to prolonged withdrawal symptoms. The ‘habit’ element of smoking is not broken whilst a smoker continues to have occasional puffs. Smoking following the quit date reduces the client’s self-efficacy, which only increases through\r\ncontinued abstinence. Self-control, also valuable in quitting, is similarly related to the length of time a client abstains and will not build up if the client continues to smoke. Empirical studies have shown that lapses are commonly followed by relapses, in up to 95%\r\nof cases. The ‘not-a-puff’ rule is associated with better outcomes than gradual cessation, in both supported\r\nand unsupported quit attempts. Harm reduction, where continued smoking is permitted with concomitant use of pharmacotherapy (i.e. nicotine replacement therapy; NRT) to reduce consumption, can be recommended for smokers\r\nwho are unwilling or unable to stop.",

      "title": "SMOKING CESSATION – WHAT’S NEW?",
      "abstract": "Tobacco cessation represents a multifaceted approach involving patients who often don't neatly fit into classic prototypes.Researchers found that current smokers experience a more than 10-year reduction in life expectancy compared to non-smokers, and more than half make an attempt each year, but less than 10% manage to stay smoke-free for at least 6 months.Therefore, it's recommended to employ a combination of methods and strategies, ranging from questionnaires to established medications.The role of the medical staff is and remains vital in this context.Nicotine is a potent drug due to its rapid absorption and swift diffusion into the central nervous system, and quitting nicotine leads to important consequences, such as craving, drug-seeking behaviour and withdrawal symptoms.Negative affective states also emerge, characterized by symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.Hierarchical multiple regression models have revealed that extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness and age are among the predictors of daily cigarette consumption.The authors discuss both traditional and innovative opportunities to expedite this process, while analysing the potential to enhance the compliance of healthcare providers and patients.Smoking cessation, the process of quitting smoking, can be approached through both pharmacological (medication-based) and non-pharmacological (behavioural and supportive) methods.The choice of approach or combination of approaches depends on individual preferences and needs. RezumatRenunțarea la fumat reprezintă o abordare complexă a unui pacient care adesea nu se încadrează în prototipurile clasice.Cercetările au evidențiat că fumătorii se confruntă cu o reducere de peste 10 ani a speranței de viață în comparație cu nefumătorii și mai mult de jumătate fac o încercare de a renunța în fiecare an, dar mai puțin de 10% reușesc să rămână abstinenți cel puțin 6 luni.Prin urmare, se recomandă utilizarea unei combinații de metode și strategii, de la chestionare la medicamente deja stabilite, iar rolul personalului medical este și rămâne vital în acest context.Nicotina este un drog puternic datorită absorbției și difuzării rapide în sistemul nervos central, iar renunțarea conduce la efecte secundare importante, precum dorința arzătoare, comportamentul de căutare a drogului și simptomele de sevraj.Apar și stări afective negative, caracterizate prin simptome precum depresie, anxietate, iritabilitate și insomnie.Modelele ierarhice de regresie multiplă au dezvăluit că extraversia, nevroticismul, conștiinciozitatea și vârsta se numără printre predictorii consumului zilnic de țigări.Autorii discută oportunități vechi și noi de a accelera acest proces analizând posibilitatea de a îmbunătăți complianța furnizorilor de servicii medicale și a pacienților.Procesul de renunțare la fumat, poate fi abordat atât prin metode farmacologice, cât și prin metode comportamentale și de susținere.Alegerea abordării sau combinația de abordări depinde de preferințele și nevoile individuale.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased considerably during the last 15 years. One of the major problems dealing with cannabis use is driving under the influence of drugs. With the exception of ethyl alcohol, the majority of the epidemiological studies have shown that cannabis is the most frequently detected substance in people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Experimental studies are therefore needed to assess cannabis effects on driving capability. Many studies indicate that cannabis impairs psychomotor performance. This impairment becomes obvious when high doses of cannabis are taken, when ethyl alcohol or other drugs are simultaneously ingested, or when sustained attention is needed. Moreover, cannabis effects are qualitatively different from those observed after ethyl alcohol consumption. In forensic practice, cannabis impairment of driving performance must be related to cannabinoids blood concentrations. To facilitate the interpretation of cannabinoids blood levels, several models were set up recently. These models must be further improved in order to fit in with all circumstances of cannabis use.",

What is more shocking is the fact that people from virtually all walks of life have been found to indulge in drug use, which was once thought to be limited to those involved with entertainment establishments. It is particularly ominous that a rising number of teenagers are using drugs. Young people often know more about drugs than do their parents and teachers and the teenager who doesn`t know where he can find illegal drugs is a rarity. Today many young people experiment with drugs. Drug use is a health hazard with particular relevance to young people. Adolescent psychoses occur in association with drug-taking. Persistent drug use may block development. It may promote extremely dangerous behaviour; it is associated with suicide attempts and fatal or debilitating accidents through the power of drugs to alter perception and psychometer reactions. As with alcohol abuse, the drug user is likely to fail in many ways, at school, in relationships, and at work. Many young people have turned to crime and prostitution to maintain their supply of drugs. The author suggests various preventive strategies for adolescent drug abuse in relation with the law on protection for youth in Korea. The preventive strategies should cover national survey an youth drug abuse, drug education for students, treatment and rehabilitation for drug users, and drug abuse related laws and regulations.",

Data BNN menunjukkan banyaknya penyalahgunaan narkoba pada generasi milenial atau generasi muda yang angkanya terus meningkat. Kota Tegal merupakan salah satu wilayah di Jawa Tengah yang memiliki jumlah penduduk dengan rentang usia remaja yang cukup besar, yang sangat potensial untuk dapat dijadikan sebagai tempat peredaran narkoba. Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) menyatakan penyalahgunaan dan peredaran narkotika di masyarakat menunjukkan peningkatan dengan meluasnya korban akibat narkoba. Tingginya paparan narkotika pada remaja perlu mendapatkan perhatian adalah bahwa target utama pasar narkotika ini adalah para remaja. Kalangan remaja yang terpapar narkotika lebih rentan sebagai pengguna jangka panjang, karena mereka memiliki waktu yang cukup panjang dalam mengkonsumsi narkoba. Dampak penggunaan narkoba ternyata dapat menimbulkan masalah lain yang tidak kalah mengerikan, sehingga penanganan penyalahgunaan narkoba perlu mendapatkan pehatian yang serius. Penanganan yang bersifat promotif dan preventif perlu dikedepankan sebelum dilakukan tindakan represif. Melibatkan secara aktif remaja dalam upaya penanganan yang bersifat promotif dan preventif merupakan salah satu solusi untuk mengurangi penyebaran Narkoba di kalangan remaja.Tujuan dari dilaksanakannya pengabdian masyarakat di Kelurahan Debong Kulon ini adalah untuk meningkatkan peran dan partisipasi mitra (remaja) dalam kegiatan P4GN, meningkatkan pengetahuan remaja terkait kegiatan P4GN dan meningkatkan motivasi remaja dalam kegiatan P4GN. Sedangkan manfaat yang ingin dicapai dari kegiatan ini adalah mitra (remaja) dapat berpartisipasi aktif dalam kegiatan P4GN dan dapat termotivasi untuk teribat dalam kegiatan P4GN. Untuk mencapai tujuan kegiatan pengabdian masyarakat di Kelurahan Debong Kulon Kota Tegal, dilakukan melalui beberapa pendekatan, antara lain dengan Model Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), Model Community development, Persuasif dan Edukatif. Hasil yag dicapai dari pengabdian masyarakat ini adalah tersedianya boklet atau modul tentang P4GN yang dibuat oleh mitra sebagai media edukasi yang interaktif sehingga terjadi peningkatan pengetahuan dan motivasi dari mitra untuk membentuk konsep diri yang positif",

      "abstract": "Tobacco is the dried leaf of Nicotianna tabacum a plant indigenous to the U.S. but now grown in many areas of the world. The use of tobacco for smoking chewing or snuffing is indulged in by millions of people throughout the world. The poisonous properties of tobacco are mainly because of the presence of nicotine a heavy oily substance. 90% of the inhaled nicotine is absorbed as against 25-50% when the smoke is drawn only into the mouth and expelled. The acute effects of tobacco (nicotine) are transitory. The chronic use of tobacco raises problems of chronic toxicity of nicotine and other constituents of tobacco smoke. The effects include nasopharyngeal and bronchial irritation lung cancer a smokers respiratory syndrome chronic bronchitis and emphysema diseases of the cardiovascular system gastrointestinal effects and other conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Multiple drug use has always been much more prevalent within the world-wide dance club subculture which emerged from the ‘rave’ scene of the 1980s in comparison with other young people. For example, a recent British survey revealed that whereas 50% of 16 to 29 year-olds had used an illicit drug at least once in the past, the figure for ‘clubbers’ was 79%. For many of these, drug taking might only be an occasional event, but 44% agreed that ‘taking drugs is an integral part of my social life’. The breadth of drug use is also staggering. A group of Scottish dance club attenders interviewed in the 1990s had each consumed an average of 11 different drugs. Drug use within the past year was as follows: alcohol 96%; cannabis 96%; Ecstasy 87%; tobacco 86%; LSD 79%; amphetamine 77%; cocaine 59%; nitrite ‘poppers’ 51%; psilocybin 47%; temazepam 39%; diazepam 26%; codeine 19%; heroin 11%; ketamine 7%; solvents 6%; and buprenorphine 6%.",

      "abstract": "Approximately 20% of the adult population in the United States have low-literacy skills. The subpopulations with the highest incidence of low literacy are nearly identical to those with the highest prevalence of tobacco use. Low-literacy smokers are more likely to underestimate the risks related to tobacco use, have less social pressure and support to quit smoking, may experience more life stress and consequently rely more heavily on nicotine use for stress reduction and require more assistance in developing a sense of self-efficacy. This indicates a need to modify smoking cessation methods of counselling, content and selection of educational materials for the marginally literate. Currently available low-literacy materials are listed, and suggestions for adjusting or developing materials are made.",

As smoking is an important risk factor for the development of numerous diseases and a number of smoking-cessation strategies have proved to be effective every smoker should be encouraged to give up smoking and be informed of these methods. A more widespread use of evidence-based smoking-cessation methods should therefore be promoted more vigorously. Evidence based smoking-cessation guidelines summarising the main treatment recommendations suggest that maximum support towards motivating the smoker be made available. Only if other treatments are not available, should this take the form of brief contacts. More complex interventions should be supplemented by behaviour therapy aimed at changing behaviour patterns. Medical support in the form of nicotine replacement (NRT) or bupropion treatment should be offered. Moreover international guidelines (not only German ones but also American, and European ones in general) all recommend as the most effective strategy the combining of smoking-cessation methods based on behavioural treatment with nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion treatment.",

Chemical analyses have revealed the presence of toxic organic compounds and heavy metals, the inhalation of which is linked to an increased risk of respiratory diseases, including cancer. This risk may exceed acceptable safety thresholds, particularly with prolonged exposure. Although e-cigarettes exhibit a lower addictive potential compared to traditional cigarettes, their use—especially among adolescents—has been associated with worsening asthma symptoms and a higher frequency of wheezing episodes. Adverse effects on the cardiovascular system have also been demonstrated, along with potential negative outcomes during pregnancy and for fetal development. A clear link has been established between e-cigarette use and EVALI (E-cigarette or Vaping product use-Associated Lung Injury), a severe lung condition related to vaping. While some evidence suggests that nicotine-containing e-cigarettes may aid in smoking cessation, the safety of their use for this purpose remains uncertain.",

      "title": "Managing unhealthy alcohol use in general practice",
      "abstract": "WHAT IS UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE?Unhealthy alcohol use is an umbrella term that encompasses a spectrum of behaviours, ranging from risky drinking to alcohol use disorder. (1)Risky alcohol use is defined as: binge drinking, heavy drinking, or any alcohol use by pregnant women or those under 21 years of age. (2)Alcohol use disorder is categorised by severity according to the number of criteria present (Fig. 1). (3)Mild alcohol use disorder is broadly equivalent to alcohol abuse, while moderate and severe alcohol use disorder are broadly equivalent to alcohol dependence, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition). Local recommendationsIn Singapore, the maximum recommended alcohol intake is two standard drinks per day for men and one standard drink per day for women. (4)Definitions of a standard drink vary internationally.In Singapore, one standard drink is equivalent to 10 g of pure alcohol (Fig. 2) compared to 14 g in the United States.The United Kingdom defines one unit as 8 g of pure alcohol. (5)nother useful way of calculating alcohol intake is by using the following formula: (6) number of standard drinks = amount of drink (in litres) × alcohol by volume (%) × 0.789 (density of ethanol at room temperature).For example, for a 500-mL bottle of beer that is 5% alcohol by volume, the number of standard drinks it contains is: 0.5 × 5 × 0.789 = 1.97 standard drinks. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE?According to the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016, 4.1% and 0.5% of the population suffer from alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, respectively, at some point in their lifetime.Those who were more likely to have alcohol use disorders were male, aged 18-34 years, of lower education attainment and employed.Among all people with a mental disorder who sought help, 20% presented to a general practitioner. (7)he prevalence of binge drinking, in particular, is a rapidly growing problem, with a prevalence of 13.7% in 2016.Male and younger individuals (aged 18-34 years) were more likely to binge drink. (8)Underage drinking is also a problem, with a World Health Organization study from 2004 demonstrating that 73.5% of males and 64.5% of females aged 15-19 years drank alcohol. (9)",

      "abstract": "Stress is one of the common mental health problems in today's society. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between stress levels and smoking behavior. Smoking is a habit that is detrimental to health and can be a risk factor for a variety of serious diseases. However, many individuals who smoke may claim that smoking is their way of coping with stress. Data for the study were obtained through interviews and questionnaires given to several participants involved in smoking behavior. The data collected included stress levels, smoking history, and motivation to smoke. The results showed that there was a significant relationship between stress levels and smoking behavior. Individuals who experience higher levels of stress tend to be more likely to smoke or smoke more frequently. In addition, the study also revealed that many smoking participants reported that they smoked as a way to cope with stress. This study has important implications for treatments and interventions in reducing smoking. Understanding that stress can be a trigger for smoking can help in designing more effective evidence-based programs to help individuals cope with stress without having to rely on cigarettes. Better prevention and treatment efforts for individuals who smoke should also consider stress management as an important part of treatment. As such, the study could provide a better view of the complex relationship between stress and smoking and provide a foundation for better public health improvements in tackling the smoking problem",

      "title": "PELATIHAN BAHAYA NARKOBA DAN KENAKALAN REMAJA TERHADAP MANAJEMEN KEUANGAN",
      "abstract": "Menurut UU No. 22 Tahun 1997, Narkotika adalah “zat atau obat yang berasal dari tanaman atau bukan tanaman baik sintesis maupun semi sintesis yang dapat menyebabkan penurunan atau perubahan kesadaran, hilangnya rasa, mengurangi sampai menghilangkan rasa nyeri, dan dapat menimbulkan ketergantungan”. Sebenarnya Narkoba adalah obat legal yang digunakan dalam dunia kedokteran, namun dewasa ini Narkoba banyak disalahgunakan. Bahkan di kalangan remaja tidak sedikit yang terjerumus dalam bahaya narkoba. Banyak dari mereka yang menggunakan Narkoba dengan alasan untuk Upaya pemberantasan Narkoba pun sudah sering dilakukan, namun masih sedikit kemungkinan untuk menghindarkan Narkoba dari kalangan remaja maupun dewasa. Hingga saat ini upaya yang paling efektif untuk mencegah pengaruh Narkoba pada remaja yaitu dari pendidikan, keluarga. Orangtua diharapkan mengawasi dan mendidik anaknya untuk selalu menjauhi narkoba. Dan hingga kini narkoba pun telah merajalela di kalangan para remaja. Hal tersebut akan mengganggu prestasi belajar siswa yang mengkonsumsi Narkoba tersebut. Jika para remaja khususnya usia sekolah mengkonsumsi Narkoba tanpa henti (ketagihan) akan merusak beberapa jaringan di tubuh pecandu yang mengakibatkan tidak konsentrasi dalam pelajaran, selalu gelisah, tidak fokus pada pelajaran sehingga prestasi siswa pecandu akan menurun. Jika banyak remaja yang banyak mengkonsumsi narkoba dan banyak pula remaja yang sekolah akan kehilangan prestasi belajarnya. Kenakalan remaja adalah pelampiasan masalah yang dihadapi oleh kalangan remaja yang tindakannya menyimpang. Menurut ahli sosiologi Kartono, Kenakalan Remaja atau dalam bahasa Inggris dikenal dengan istilah juvenile delinquency merupakan gejala patologis sosial pada remaja yang disebabkan oleh satu bentuk pengabaian sosial. Akibatnya mereka mengembangkan bentuk perilaku yang menyimpang. Sedangkan menurut Santrock “Kenakalan remaja merupakan kumpulan dari berbagai perilaku remaja yang tidak dapat diterima secara sosial hingga terjadi tindakan kriminal.” Dengan adanya kenakalan remaja maka akan berpengaruh terhadap keuangan pribadi seseorang. Kesuksesan financial seseorang ditentukan oleh perilaku keuangan inividu itu sendiri. Tentunya banyak faktor yang mempengaruhi perilaku manajemen keuangan. Dalam teori perilaku terencana berasumsi bahwa perilaku seseorang dipengaruhi oleh sikap dan norma lain yang dipengaruhi oleh faktor eksternal, contohnya pengalaman, tingkat literasi dan pengetahuan seseorang. Perilaku manajemen keuangan adalah “kemampuan seseorang dalam mengatur (perencanaan, penganggaran, pemeriksaan, pengelolaan, pengendalian, pencarian dan penyimpanan) dana keuangan sehari-hari. Munculnya perilaku financial management, merupakan dampak dari besarnya hasrat seseorang untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidupnya sesuai dengan tingkat pendapatan yang diperoleh” (Al Kholilah &amp; Iramani, 2013). Dalam program kegiatan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat (PKM) kali ini sasarannya adalah para santriwan santriwati di yayasan Alkamilah dengan memberikan pengetahuan mengenai bahaya narkoba. Lembaga pendidikan diharapkan juga mampu mendidik mereka untuk menjadi generasi bebas narkoba dan kenakalan remaja khususnya para santri. Berdasarkan permasalahan yang dihadapi anggota Yayasan Alkamilah, Bojongsari, Depok, melalui kegiatan pengabdian kepada masyarakat (PKM) para dosen dan mahasiswa dari Universitas Pamulang mencoba membantu memberikan pelatihan-pelatihan yang dibutuhkan Yayasan Alkamilah untuk para anak didiknya. Diharapkan dengan pelatihan bahaya narkoba dan kenakalan remaja terhadap manajemen keuangan ini dapat membantu menambah ilmu pengetahuan, meningkatkan wawasan para santri di yayasan tersebut.

      "abstract": "Publisher Summary\r\nRounding off the “central eight” risk/need factors is substance abuse. Subsumed under substance abuse are alcohol misuse and the use of illegal drugs. Alcohol and other drug abuse are quite prevalent among offender populations, but their relationship to crime is moderate. The prevalence of alcohol abuse among offender samples is quite high, certainly much higher than that found in the general population. Offenders and victims also report a high incidence of drinking at the time of the offense. Treatments for alcohol abuse include a variety of interventions such as pharmacological treatment, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and alcoholics anonymous. This chapter discusses the community reinforcement approach to alcohol abuse. Unlike alcohol abuse, illegal drug abuse has a closer relationship to crime because of the illicit status of drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and so on. An addiction to any of these drugs places a person directly into contact with other criminals and, in many cases, may exert pressure to engage in other illegal activity in order to buy drugs. Some drugs directly initiate thoughts that lead to antisocial behavior. Substance abuse, undifferentiated from alcohol misuse, is a commonly found risk factor for crime among adults and young offenders. Treatment from a theoretical perspective includes offsetting the rewards associated with substance abuse involves altering many reinforcement contingencies.",

      "title": "Tobacco product use among youth in Ukraine",
      "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> The tobacco industry is actively developing new types of tobacco products (TP), which are rapidly spreading throughout the world, especially among youth. Young people in Ukraine are more predisposed to TP use due to living in war conditions and searching for means to combat stress. <b>Aims:</b> To study the prevalence of different types of TP use among youth in Ukraine during the war. <b>Methods:</b> The online survey was conducted during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in November-December 2022. The questionnaire was distributed among the target audience via groups in social networks and instant messaging apps. <b>Results:</b> We received answers from 203 respondents (RS) with a mean age of 19.7 ± 1.7 years (136 women (67%), 67 men (33%)). TP use was noted by 168 RS (82.8%). The most common types were heat-not-burn tobacco devices - 99 RS (48.8%) and e-cigarettes - 83 RS (40.9%). Traditional cigarette smoking took third place - 76 RS (37.4%). A quarter of the participants used hookah - 50 RS (24.6%). Snus was used by 8 RS (3.9%), snuff – 4 RS (2%), and chewing tobacco – 4 RS (2%). Only one type of TP used by 67 RS (33%) - heat-not-burn tobacco devices in 21 cases (10.3%), e-cigarettes - in 19 cases (9.4%), cigarettes - in 17 cases (8.4%), hookah – in 8 cases (4.0%), snus – in 2 cases (1.0%). Two TP types were used by 56 RS (27.6%), 39 RS (19.2%) – three TP types, 4 RS (2%) – four TP types, and 2 RS (1%) used 5 TP types. <b>Conclusions:</b> Most young people in Ukraine use heat-not-burn tobacco devices and e-cigarettes. More than a third of RS smoke cigarettes. Two-thirds of RS use two or more TP.",

      "abstract": "A historia da humanidade nos mostra o gosto constante que o homem em geral tem pela bebida alcoolica. Desde sempre sao mais preferidas que as outras, pelo seu efeito tonico e euforizante, para aliviar a angustia e para liberar o que esta reprimido. Grande parte da polucao, sem distincao de sexo, acredita que sua “performance” ou “bom desempenho fisico” tem sua causa na ingestao de bebida alcoolica. O uso de bebidas alcoolicas e tao antigo quanto a propria humanidade. Beber moderada e esporadicamente faz parte dos habitos de diversas sociedades. Determinar o limite entre o beber social, ou o uso abusivo ou nocivo de alcool e o alcoolismo (sindrome de dependencia do alcool) sao por vezes dificil, pois esses limites sao tenues, variam de pessoa para pessoa e de cultura para cultura. O alcoolismo ou SDA (Sindrome de Dependencia do Alcool) e hoje uma das doencas com consequencias fisicas e sociais mais danosas, “que leva o individuo a desenvolver problemas biologicos, sociais ou psicologicos”. O presente artigo apresenta algumas complicacoes acerca do uso excessivo de alcool e os beneficios da atividade fisica como tratamento auxiliar, nao farmacologico, na recuperacao dos orgaos afetados pelo uso do alcool. Identificando-se assim uma nova proposta para reabilitacao das pessoas acometidas por esta patologia.

      "title": "The Impact of Smokeless Tobacco, Nicotine Pouches, and Electronic Cigarettes on Oral Health. Summary of the Doctoral Thesis",
      "abstract": "\"In recent years, new tobacco and nicotine-containing products have emerged that offer colourful designs and a variety of flavours. These products are becoming increasingly popular, not only with traditional tobacco users, but also with new smokers. One of these new nicotine products are nicotine pouches, which resemble smokeless tobacco in appearance and use. Although the sale of smokeless tobacco is prohibited in Latvia, it is widely used, especially among athletes. Nicotine pouches, or smokeless tobacco sachets, are placed under the upper or lower lip and allow the absorption of tobacco, nicotine and other substances through the oral mucosa. As these products do not produce smoke, they are easy to use without disturbing others. Meanwhile, electronic cigarettes are attracting not only current tobacco users, ostensibly to help them to quit smoking, but also individuals who have never used tobacco products before. Unfortunately, disposable electronic cigarettes are widely used by children, leading not only to serious addiction problems but also to health problems requiring hospitalisation. At present, the public and the authorities are under the impression, largely created by these manufacturers, that these new tobacco and nicotine products are a much better alternative to cigarettes and therefore their sale should not be banned. Moreover, such claims are supported by research funded by or associated with these manufacturers. As these products have only recently entered the market, studies on their effects on oral and general health are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of smokeless tobacco products, nicotine pouches and electronic smoking devices on oral microbiota, salivary inflammatory biomarkers and overall oral health. Five scientific articles have been published based on the results of the research and the Thesis will be defended as a series of publications. The research design includes four sections. The first section includes a survey of respondents about general health, oral health habits, diet, lifestyle and use of tobacco and nicotine products. Respondents were selected based on inclusion criteria, followed by oral examinations and the collection of saliva and biofilm samples. The second section includes a histopathological and visual examination of clinical changes in the oral cavity. In the third section, inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) and LRG-1 in saliva samples are examined. In the fourth section periodontal pathogens and other microorganisms (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Rothia mucilaginosa) in saliva, subgingival and supragingival biofilm samples are investigated. The results show that users of smokeless tobacco and nicotine pouches report dry mouth and tingling of the mucous membranes. Users of electronic cigarettes and pouches are prone to bleeding gums, increased plaque build-up, gum recession, altered taste and bad breath. In addition, in areas where pouches are placed, mucosal changes can be seen, clinically characterised as white keratoses of varying roughness and shape. Histological examination of these mucosal samples shows parakeratosis with marked acanthotic mucosal thickening, intraepithelial and connective tissue oedema and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes and macrophages. Such changes can be defined as mild dysplasia, which is a precancerous condition. In addition, smokeless tobacco and nicotine pouch users who were clinically diagnosed with oral mucosal changes had elevated levels of IL-6 in saliva. Periodontal pathogenic microorganisms are found in the saliva and periodontal pockets of users of electronic cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and nicotine pouches, suggesting that the use of these products may lead to periodontitis. The study data suggest that these products negatively impact oral health and are a serious risk factor for the development of periodontitis and mucosal disease. Furthermore, as these products have only recently entered the market, the long-term effects on oral health are not yet known. The Doctoral Thesis was developed at Rīga Stradiņš University, Department of Biology and microbiology.

      "title": "Alcohol Actions on Glutamate Receptors",
      "abstract": "Alcohol is arguably the oldest drug known to man, its use dating back at least 10,000 yr to the dawn of human civilization (1). Although illicit drug use often receives more attention in contemporary society, alcohol abuse exacts a devastating toll: In the United States at present, over 7% of the population meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or alcoholism (2), over 28% of children under 18 yr of age are exposed to alcohol abuse or dependence in the home (3), and the overall economic cost to society of alcohol abuse has been estimated at $ 185 billion (4). Despite intensive research since the latter part of the previous century, it is clear that the biological actions that are responsible for the characteristic effects of ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, on human physiology and behavior are still incompletely understood. Because of the simple chemical structure of ethanol (it differs from water only by two methylene groups) and its low potency (it produces most of its biological effects at millimolar concentrations), alcohol undoubtedly interacts with multiple sites in the central nervous system. The biological effects of alcohol almost certainly reflect its concerted actions at a number of these sites. Of the many possible targets of alcohol actions, neurotransmitter receptors, and in particular, neurotransmitter-gated receptor-ion channels are currently believed to be among the most important (5). Because the neurotransmitter glutamate mediates the majority of fast excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system via actions on glutamate-gated receptor-ion channels (6), effects of alcohol on these ion channels could profoundly alter central nervous system function.",

Cette prise deconscience par les pouvoirs publics se traduit dans le projetde loi HPST, couplee a des actions de prevention afin desensibiliser les jeunes aux dangers lies a l’exces d’alcool.Mots cles Alcoolisme · Adolescence · IvresseAbstract Binge drinking refers to an alcohol intake of atleast 5 drinks on a single occasion and in a limited period oftime (less than two hours). Most of the time, binge drinkingoccurs during weekend evenings. The only goal of the bingedrinker is to get drunk, whatever quantity of alcohol isneeded. This behavior usually begins around 12-13 years ofage, and dramatically increases after high school, in thecontext of parties. The 18-25 age range represents almosthalf of binge drinking prevalence. Maintenance of thisbehavior after 25 could be a predictive factor of futurealcohol dependence; about 50% of binge drinkers becomedependent. Health care professionals have an important roleto play, not only during routine visits, but particularly afteran accident or suicide attempt. Adolescents should beroutinely asked about their alcohol drinking behavior, inorder to give them the opportunity to talk freely about theirproblems. Once problems are recognized, they should bereferred to the appropriate forums. Parents should beinvolved in the therapeutic process whenever possible.Recent public awareness of the binge drinking problem hasled to government action, together with prevention activitiesoriented towards the youth.Keywords Alcoholism · Adolescence · IntoxificationEn 2006, pres de 80 millions d’Europeensâgesdeplusde15 ans reconnaissaient avoir recours au binge drinking,consommationexcessived ’alcoolquiapourbutl etatd ivresse.Repandu chez les adolescents et developpe au cours deces 20 dernieres annees au Royaume-Uni, le binge drinkingetait tellement populaire que l’on a parle de binge Britain.Iln’y a pas de traduction precise en francais, meme si l’onpeut parler de « beuverie express », de « mines », de« defonce », de « cuites » ou de « blindes ».Le binge drinking est une consommation superieure acinq verres d’alcool pris a la suite en un temps limite(inferieur a deux heures), en general lors d’une soireependant un week-end [1-3].

      "abstract": "Drug addiction, or substance abuse disorder, has a long history. The use of a drug that causes dependence has been used in various religious and tribal initiation ceremonies. Currently, recreational use or peer modelling leads an individual to substance abuse. The magnitude of the problem of addiction increases multifold in the presence of stressors like broken families, joblessness, occupational stress, etc.The de-addiction process is used to relieve an individual's craving for the drug. It is a painful process, as several effects of withdrawal compel a person to return to the drugs again and again. Our aim is to explore the available literature on the use of Unani medicine for de-addiction.We surveyed various classical books from the available literature for drug de-addiction in Unani medicine. Indexed journals were also surveyed for the available related material using various keywords like \"opium addiction\" and \"Unani medicine and de-addiction \" and the information was filtered for this review.We observed that there was an elaborate scheme for de-addiction in opium addiction and the process is so general that it could serve as a framework for the de-addiction process for other similar drugs.Unani medicine is significant in the literature as being among the the available de-addiction addiction processes and may furnish several leads for various herbal drugs that may be used for de-addiction in the future.",

      "abstract": "Le mot « addiction » est recent dans le vocabulaire medical francais. Plus qu'une simple adaptation d'un terme anglo-saxon, cela traduit une veritable revolution conceptuelle dans le domaine de la consommation des produits psychoactifs, alcool, tabac, cannabis et autres drogues illicites. Pendant longtemps, l'action medicale a ce sujet etait centree sur le produit consomme, faite de mises en garde ou d'interdits le concernant. Parler d'addiction, donc centrer la reflexion sur le comportement de consommation plus que sur le produit, remonte a la fin des annees 90, bien synthetisee dans le rapport Parquet [1]. Premiere consequence : la prevention doit etre plus globale, necessitant un reperage precoce des conduites a risque, une approche differente dans la prise en charge, incluant des reseaux multidisciplinaires et la participation de l'entourage. Deuxieme consequence : d'autres comportements ont egalement des potentialites addictives ; il est vite apparu que le concept d'addiction allait bien au-dela des comportements de consommation de « drogues », et pouvait concerner la consommation de medicaments psychotropes, certains comportements alimentaires ou d'activite physique, le dopage, les jeux de hasard...

      "abstract": "Feeling down from time to time is a normal part of life but when emptiness and despair take hold and won’t go away, it may be depression - “living in a black hole” or having feeling of impending doom. Symptoms - you can’t sleep or you sleep too much, you can’t concentrate or find that previously easy tasks are now difficult, you feel hopeless and helpless, you can’t control your negative thoughts, no matter how much you try, you have lost your appetite or you can’t stop eating. Non-pharmacological treatment should involve exercise, psychotherapy, supplements and your pleasures, etc. Exercise has been found to be most effective treatment for depression and the minimum recommendation is three times per week for 20 minutes. Weekly psychotherapy and a check on your pleasures like coffee, alcohol, sugar and recreational drugs, and supplements like taking fish oil for omega-3, fatty acid daily, St. John’s Wort, and vitamins-B12, etc. Direct exposure to sunlight every day is very helpful, if not possible, a light box can bring a lot of relief. Regular human contact who enjoy the same things you do, challenge your thinking, good nutrition, yoga and meditation only for mild to moderate depression. Data collected from doctors shows that 60% of doctors have opinion that 35-60 years is common age group of depression, 50% doctors said that duration of therapy depends upon patient to patient, the root cause of depression is family reasons which is admitted by 70% of doctors. The most prescribed drugs for the treatment of depression are - Imipramine 40%, Fluoxetine 30%, most prescribed drugs in pregnancy are - Fluoxetine 60%, Sertraline 20%, most prescribed drugs in lactation - Fluoxetine 70%, Amitryptiline 20% and 90% of doctors suggested that only counseling is sufficient to treat depression in children.",

Why don't people quit smoking? Why do smokers relapse when they try to quit? Do addicted smokers suffer from irresistible cravings? Are there some people who cannot quit? Are there conditions that make resistance impossible? Why would they smoke knowing it can kill them? The evidence reviewed here seems most consistent with the view that smokers retain control over their actions but cannot easily stop having frequent desires to smoke.",

Die gleiche Erfahrung machen wir tagtäglich mit Suchtkranken: Trotz intensiver Motivierung zur Abstinenz gelingt die Abstinenz nicht oder nur partiell. Was hat zu diesem hohen und lange Zeit singulär bestehendem therapeutischem Zielanspruch der Abstinenz beigetragen? Hier können vielleicht die Entwicklung der Suchttherapie aus einer kirchlichen Tradition mit einer Anfälligkeit für Dogmen, die Erfahrung der Ohnmacht Betroffener und deren Einfluss auf therapeutische Ansätze in der Selbsthilfe oder auch die Funktion des Suchtkranken als Objekt von Phantasien und Neidprojektionen seitens der Gesellschaft oder der Therapeuten genannt werden. In keinem Bereich der psychischen Erkrankungen ist der Anteil von Betroffenen in spezifischer Behandlung so gering wie in der Sucht, bei Alkoholkranken wird nur jeder 10. von spezifischer Therapie erreicht. Hierzu mag das für viele Betroffene unattraktive Ziel der Abstinenz beigetragen haben. In der Forschung war und ist übrigens die Reduktion der Trinkmenge ein gängiger Zielparameter.",

      "title": "Marijuana and lung diseases",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review Cannabis sativa (marijuana) is used throughout the world, and its use is increasing. In much of the world, marijuana is illicit. While inhalation of smoke generated by igniting dried components of the plant is the most common way marijuana is used, there is concern over potential adverse lung effects. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent studies that explore the impact upon the respiratory system of inhaling marijuana smoke. Recent findings Smoking marijuana is associated with chronic bronchitis symptoms and large airway inflammation. Occasional use of marijuana with low cumulative use is not a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The heavy use of marijuana alone may lead to airflow obstruction. The immuno-histopathologic and epidemiologic evidence in marijuana users suggests biological plausibility of marijuana smoking as a risk for the development of lung cancer; at present, it has been difficult to conclusively link marijuana smoking and cancer development. Summary There is unequivocal evidence that habitual or regular marijuana smoking is not harmless. A caution against regular heavy marijuana usage is prudent. The medicinal use of marijuana is likely not harmful to lungs in low cumulative doses, but the dose limit needs to be defined. Recreational use is not the same as medicinal use and should be discouraged.",

      "abstract": "The older view of addiction was that people became addicted because they were ignorant of the risks of addiction, they were unhappy, or they lacked healthy opportunities. Once addicted, they were hooked by physical dependence, causing them to continue use despite wanting to quit. The new paradigm of addiction focuses on reward and the powerful experience of falling in love with the feeling that addictive behaviors produce. Potential addicts seek brain reward and are heedless of the risks, of which they are seldom ignorant. Withdrawal is largely irrelevant. The problem of addiction is the power of brain reward. The new view of addiction has important implications for prevention, treatment, public policy, and medical treatment with controlled substances.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking has been responsible for 1 million deaths worldwide and predicted would kill 1 billion people in this century. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vaping become more popular in recent years and used by many tobacco smokers as alternative method to smoking cessations. Surprisingly, the new technology made this device more attractive for most teenager and young adults, who had never smoke. Many research has been conducted to answer the pro(s) and con(s) about the benefit and harm of vaping. E-cigarettes caused many health effects, such as cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, and psychological behavior effects. The in vivo and in vitro studies found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role for the development of diseases. For conclusions, more researches are still needed to found the effectiveness of e-cigarette as a smoking cessation therapy, including short term and long term health risks.",

      "abstract": "As bebidas energéticas são compostos gaseificados que contêm em sua composição cafeína e taurina, estimulantes que, combinados, aumentam a excitabilidade neuronal, a pressão arterial e a atividade do sistema nervoso central, aumentando a concentração e agitação e diminuindo a sensação de cansaço. O consumo em grandes quantidades e em longo prazo pode gerar efeitos adversos, como arritmias, palpitações, taquicardia, dispnéia, insônia e ansiedade. Outros estimulantes presentes nos energéticos, como guaraná e L-carnitina, potencializam os efeitos da cafeína e podem provocar sobrecarga no organismo, especialmente quando consumidos em excesso. Tais efeitos são ainda maximizados se o uso do energético for combinado ao álcool, sendo mais prejudicial à saúde do que a utilização apenas do álcool. Isso ocorre porque a cafeína mascara os efeitos sedativos do álcool, levando à ingestão de maiores quantidades do mesmo. O início precoce do consumo do energético também pode induzir à dependência do álcool pelo jovem. O consumo desenfreado de bebidas energéticas pelos jovens já se configura como um problema de saúde pública no Brasil e em muitos países. Também há uma preocupação crescente quanto ao fato de que o marketing desses produtos é frequentemente direcionado ao público jovem, utilizando-se uma linguagem descontraída e os associando a esportes e festas, o que contribui para a normalização desse consumo ainda na adolescência. Devido a isso, tais bebidas necessitam ser devidamente regulamentadas, quanto ao marketing, formulação padronizada e rotulagem, além da necessidade de campanhas educativas direcionadas ao público jovem quanto aos riscos de consumo, principalmente associado à bebida alcoólica.",

      "abstract": "The great majority of smokers are chronically dependent on tobacco. This dependence arises from the rituals and sensory associations of smoking that are reinforced, within seconds, by a rapid burst of nicotine from the cigarette. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) — gum, patches and inhaler — and bupropion are safe and effective for increasing smoking cessation rates in the short and long terms. Other than those who are minimally dependent, all patients willing to quit should be offered one of these therapies unless contraindications exist. The effectiveness of drug treatments is multiplied when associated with effective counseling or behavioral treatments. While NRT is not recommended during pregnancy or in patients with cardiac disease, if the alternative is smoking NRT is almost certainly safe. Combination NRT (more than one therapy) may be indicated in patients who have failed monotherapy in association with withdrawal symptoms. There are some specific contraindications to the use of bupropion. Its subsidized availability should not influence prescribers to ignore these.",

The continuing growth of youthful smoking and other substance use is often explained by appeal to global psychological variables such as self- esteem, where the young smoker is assumed to smoke, drink, or take drugs to compensate for low levels of self-esteem. This paper sets out a brief critique of the deployment of 'self-esteem' as a global variable in understanding adolescent smoking, and argues for a more complex vision of self-identity as a means of connecting young people's ideas about themselves with their concrete health behaviours.",

Middle-aged and older smokers weigh less than comparably aged non-smokers but smoking has minimal impact on body weight in young smokers. Smoking cessation produces weight gain in both men and women, although the magnitude of this gain and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Physical activity does not appear to be a factor. The effect of smoking cessation on energy intake is complicated, with few studies looking at changes after long periods, but there do seem to be sustained increases in energy intake in women. Removal of the acute increases in metabolic rate caused by smoking may contribute to post-cessation weight gain but there are no reliable long-term changes in metabolic rate after cessation. Behavioural and pharmacologic interventions to prevent weight gain after cessation are described.",

Many public and private institutions have instituted no-smoking policies or have restricted smoking to particular areas. Smoking restrictions are a sensible and targeted policy tool for limiting exposure to cigarette smoke. The presence of environmental tobacco smoke is a classic externality problem. Smokers derive pleasure from smoking, but it gives rise to a side effect that is undesirable for those exposed to the smoke. There are two major environmental tobacco smoke risks—lung cancer and heart disease. Most of the debate in the literature and the battles in the popular press have been over the validity of the lung cancer risk estimates. The antismoking fervor has led to the support of a variety of initiatives that would dramatically restrict public smoking. The linchpin of those efforts has been the estimated health impact of ETS on non-smokers. Much of the scientific evidence concerning ETS is highly speculative.",

      "title": "Flavoured hookah and perioperative risk: Evil goes global",
      "abstract": "Sir, Tobacco (cigarette/bidi) smoking is a recognised evil in anaesthesia practice due to its adverse effects on health and increased perioperative risks. Consequently, perioperative concerns of tobacco smoking have been elaborately discussed in literature.[1] Aware of the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, tobacco-free hookah (also known as flavoured hookah, waterpipe and shisha) is increasingly being promoted and used as a safer alternative despite its potential health hazards. However, adverse effects of hookah in anaesthesia practice have not been adequately addressed. This paper aims to discuss the harmful effects of flavoured hookah and its potential impact on perioperative course and outcomes. Flavoured hookah involves waterpipe system and flavoured constituent shisha, heated with charcoal. The popularity of flavoured hookah among adolescents and young adults in India and other Asian countries has increased significantly in recent times[2] and has been termed as 'public health epidemic' in the western world. Various factors such as availability of multiple flavours, less harshness of smoke, no or less nicotine and importantly, wrong perception of less or no risk associated with its use, are promoting its usage. Although nicotine is absent, smoke of flavoured hookah contains various toxicants such as carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), volatile aldehydes and heavy metals.[3] Effects of these products include cardiovascular diseases (CO), lung diseases (volatile aldehydes) and cancer (PAH and heavy metals). Similar to cigarettes, smoke from hookah can cause ciliary damage, increase viscosity of secretions, reduce muco-ciliary clearance and thus increase the risk of perioperative pulmonary complications. Hookah also disrupts respiratory epithelium, increases airway reactivity and can lead to perioperative bronchospasm or laryngospasm. High carboxyhaemoglobin levels increase the perioperative risk of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias. The air quality found in hookah cafes is also hazardous with a significant level of particulate matter (PM2.5)[3] which can exacerbate the risk of chronic bronchitis or asthma. Additional adverse effects include increased risk of communicable diseases due to sharing of single mouthpiece by users and potential for becoming permanent smokers or dual abuse (alcohol and hookah). Considerations during anaesthesia include high perioperative risk of respiratory (tissue hypoxia from decreased blood oxygen content and leftward shift in oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve) and cardiac morbidity (ischemia, negative inotropy and arrhythmias), misinterpretation of peripheral oxygen saturation with conventional pulse oximeters (similar absorbances of carboxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin at 660 nm), high carboxyhaemoglobin and low oxyhaemoglobin on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, need for modification of drug doses secondary to cytP450 enzyme induction by PAH, changing of CO2absorbent intraoperatively and need for FiO2 = 1 or hyperbaric oxygen to reduce carboxyhaemoglobin half-life.[4] In addition, preoperative evaluation should include chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, carboxyhaemoglobin levels[5] and ABG. Although no outcome relationship has been studied between flavoured hookah smoking and anaesthesia, increased perioperative risk is likely based on the described health hazards. In the absence of data, no recommendations currently are available regarding perioperative precautions, preoperative preparation, duration of abstinence prior to surgery and need for postponement of elective surgeries. To conclude, awareness among general public about potential health risks from use of flavoured hookah is needed, especially the youth who constitute 35% of India's population[6] and are most vulnerable to its use. Since many individuals do not consider its use as smoking and are unaware of its harmful effects, they may not inform about this habit during pre-anaesthetic evaluation. Anaesthesiologists should also be aware of this increasing public health problem and its ramifications in the perioperative period. We would encourage anaesthesiologists to actively seek information from patients about its use, discuss associated concerns, educate patients about its harms and take necessary perioperative measures similar to tobacco smoking.

Despite primary prevention and cessation-based policies and interventions, quit rates are low and nicotine replacement therapies are underused and of limited efficacy. Tobacco harm reduction has garnered attention due to tobacco policy shifts and the increasing use and marketing of such products as electronic cigarettes. Social work has been criticized as ignoring this topic, and existing literature is limited. This article considers questions and concerns surrounding tobacco harm reduction, and offers guidance in formulating a social work position regarding this important issue.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Drug abuse occurs in all sports and at most levels of competition. Athletic life may lead to drug abuse for a number of reasons, including for performance enhancement, to self-treat otherwise untreated mental illness, and to deal with stressors, such as pressure to perform, injuries, physical pain, and retirement from sport. This review examines the history of doping in athletes, the effects of different classes of substances used for doping, side effects of doping, the role of anti-doping organizations, and treatment of affected athletes. Doping goes back to ancient times, prior to the development of organized sports. Performance-enhancing drugs have continued to evolve, with “advances” in doping strategies driven by improved drug testing detection methods and advances in scientific research that can lead to the discovery and use of substances that may later be banned. Many sports organizations have come to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs and have very strict consequences for people caught using them. There is variable evidence for the performance-enhancing effects and side effects of the various substances that are used for doping. Drug abuse in athletes should be addressed with preventive measures, education, motivational interviewing, and, when indicated, pharmacologic interventions.

En Estados Unidos, los cigarrillos electrónicos son más frecuentemente utilizados por los jóvenes que el cigarrillo convencional, creyendo que son menos dañinos para la salud, sin embargo, se sabe que estos dispositivos producen combustión y entregan nicotina por vía inhalada por lo que su uso lleva al consumo de cigarrillo tradicional y la exposición a sustancias cancerígenas.Por todo lo anterior, los esfuerzos del control del tabaco deben estar puestos: en políticas públicas (aumento del impuesto al tabaco, campañas publicitarias masivas, ambientes cerrados libres de humo, restricción de la publicidad ), la pesquisa precoz y tratamiento oportuno del adolescente que ya se ha iniciado en el consumo de tabaco a través del ABC-D tal como aparece en las Primeras Guías de Práctica Clínica de Tratamiento del Tabaquismo, Chile , 2017 para esto se necesita que los profesionales de salud reciban entrenamiento .

Although, narcotics' abuse was not so important during the time of Honorable Prophet Mohammed and innocent Imams (S), and we don't have any specific verse or narration in this regard, since Islam is a universal and eternal religion, and have completely provided all the needs of the society at all ages, and has met all the humankinds' wishes, so it has paid attention to this subject and has warned people from different sides about not using narcotics.

Sometimes they see drunk people on the street, at home, in the park or at the stadium, or in other public places. Quite frequently, drinking people, vulgar drunks, and alcoholics are portrayed on movie and television screens. Both on these screens and in real life, youngsters have a chance to observe drunken brawls. Lately, young people can read about the horrors of drunkenness just about every day in the newspapers. Adults tell them about the consequences of drunkenness, and don't spare them the details. We thought it would be useful not only to find out what teenagers know about drunkenness from hearsay but also what has happened to them personally after using alcohol. For this purpose, we asked them the question, \"What consequences have resulted from your use of alcoholic beverages?\" From their answers it is clear that there are all kinds of consequences, some highly unpleasant: \"I couldn't get home and passed out on the way\"; \"The police or people's volunteers picked me up\" (we should specify that these are the answers of girls as well as boys); \"I wound up in the sobering-up station\"; \"I lost my papers and money\"; \"I got in an accident on the street.\" Compared to the answers we have cited, those such as \"I was refused a trip ticket\" or \"I got into a fight with my parents\" look almost innocent.",

Their success has been dramatic but partial and excruciatingly slow, and until recently quite uncoerced by government. Cigarettes and nicotine have characteristics distinct among addictive drugs, and some of these help explain why efforts to quit smoking are so often frustrated. Nicotine itself is the most interesting chemical in the treatment of addiction and, in some forms, can pose a dilemma: compromise by settling for pure nicotine indefinitely, or stay with cigarettes and keep trying to quit. Nicotine is not alone among addictive drugs in becoming increasingly identified with the poorer classes.",

Les rares études sur le ST chez les fumeurs asthmatiques montrent l’efficacité des stratégies classiques du ST chez ces patients (substituts nicotiniques, varénicline, bupropion, thérapies cognitives et comportementales). L’arrêt du tabagisme des parents ayant des enfants asthmatiques est essentiel et repose sur les mêmes stratégies. La cigarette électronique peut être une aide utile à l’arrêt du tabac chez certains patients. L’arrêt du tabagisme est bénéfique chez les fumeurs asthmatiques : réduction des symptômes, des exacerbations aiguës, de l’hyperréactivité bronchique et de l’inflammation bronchique ; diminution du recours aux médicaments d’urgence et des doses de corticostéroïdes inhalés ; amélioration du contrôle de l’asthme, de la qualité de vie et de la fonction respiratoire.Chez les patients asthmatiques, il est essentiel d’évaluer le statut tabagique et les professionnels de santé doivent les aider à arrêter de fumer.The prevalence of smoking in asthmatic patients is similar to, or even higher than in the general population.This systematic review addresses (1) the effects of smoking on asthma, (2) smoking cessation strategies in asthmatic patients, and (3) the consequences of smoking cessation for people with asthma.Active or passive smoking can promote the development of asthma. The few studies on smoking cessation in asthma confirm the efficacy of validated smoking cessation strategies in these patients (nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, bupropion, cognitive and behavioural therapies). Smoking cessation in parents with asthmatic children is essential and is based on the same strategies. Electronic cigarettes may be a useful help to quit smoking in some patients. Smoking cessation is beneficial in asthmatic smokers and associated with (1) a reduction of asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and bronchial inflammation, (2) decreased use of rescue medications and in doses of inhaled corticosteroids, (3) improved asthma control, quality of life, and lung function.In asthmatic patients, it is essential to assess smoking status and health professionals must assist them to quit smoking.",

      "abstract": "One hundred fifty-eight users of eight or more different prescription drugs in a three-month period were identified, using computerstored pharmacy data. Compared with 99 \"light\" users of only one or two different drugs, these heavy users were more likely to be older, female, and white and to have blue collar occupations, if male, or to be housewives, if female. Heavy drug use was associated with greater use of other medical care and was usually a persistent characteristic. Prepayment for drug prescriptions was not associated with heavy use. Among heavy users were found some severely ill individuals, and some with emotional problems that appear to contribute to symptoms and requests for drugs. In a 21-month period, adverse drug reactions were experienced by 28% of heavy users as compared with 8% of light users.",

      "abstract": "Drug dependence is generally thought to involve a loss or reduction of individual autonomy. Yet of the 11 million people in the UK (27 per cent of the population aged 16–74) who have ever used illicit drugs at some point in their life, probably no more than 300,000 (1%) are drug dependent. Many commentators find the apparently self-destructive behaviour of problematic drug users difficult to explain. According to rational theory, choices are made with respect to a long timeframe so as to maximize overall utility. Under maximization, individuals cannot gradually slide towards a very high level of drug use at the expense of other activities as this would reduce their overall utility. The key to understanding drug dependence is that it involves ‘matching’ different behavioural combinations at any given point in time that do not take account of long-term consequences. There is growing evidence that drug users are much more likely to match compared to non-drug users and that they have difficulty in learning to maximize. We argue that current practice within the UK criminal justice system is implicitly based on the idea that relearning the value of alternative behaviours can lead to drug use desistance.",

That claim is increasingly in vogue, often supported by data showing the high likelihood of progression to daily tobacco use following experimentation and the high percentage of cigarette smokers, compared with cocaine users who appear addicted. In the context of criteria for addiction or dependence presented by the World Health Organization, the American Psychiatric Association, and the US Surgeon General, we consider several lines of evidence, including patterns of use, mortality, physical dependence potential, and pharmacologic addiction liability measures. Within each line of evidence, we compare nicotine with cocaine. We conclude that on the current evidence nicotine cannot be considered more addicting than cocaine. Both are highly addicting drugs for which patterns of use and the development of dependence are strongly influenced by factors such as availability, price, social pressures, and regulations, as well as certain pharmacologic characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Smoking behaviour is often encountered among the society. Although there have been many warnings about the dangers of smoking, there are still many people who choose to become active smokers. In order to review this issue, the author uses the literature review method. In the perspective of social psychology, there are several causes of smoking behaviour, especially in adolescents, such as motivation and expectations, fears, perceptions, and expectations of self-efficacy. In addition, unhealthy behaviour such as smoking can also be influenced by the concept of initiation and implementation of behaviour. Social psychology can also play a role in reducing smoking behaviour among adolescents. There are 2 ways that can be applied. First is by displaying advertisements and second by framing the messages/advertisements shown. This framing includes positive framing and negative framing.&#x0D; Keywords: smoking behavior; adolescent; psychology&#x0D; Abstrak: Perilaku merokok seringkali kita jumpai di lingkungan sekitar. Meskipun sudah banyak peringatan tentang bahaya merokok, tetapi masih banyak orang yang memilih menjadi perokok aktif. Banyak data yang menunjukkan bahwa perokok terus meningkat di setiap tahunnya. Padahal, dampak negatif merokok sangat besar. Baik bagi perokok itu sendiri, maupun bagi orang di sekitarnya. Mulai dari penyakit ringan hingga penyakit kronis yang dapat menyebabkan kematian. Penulis menggunakan metode review literatur dalam mengkaji problematika ini. Dalam perspektif psikologi sosial, terdapat beberapa penyebab perilaku merokok, khususnya pada remaja, seperti, motivasi dan harapan, ketakutan, persepsi, serta harapan efikasi diri. Selain itu, perilaku tidak sehat seperti merokok juga dapat dipengaruhi oleh konsep inisiasi dan implementasi perilaku. Psikologi sosial juga dapat berperan untuk membantu mengurangi perilaku merokok pada remaja. Ada 2 cara yang dapat diterapkan. Pertama, dengan menampilkan iklan yang relevan dan yang kedua, dengan melakukan framing terhadap pesan atau iklan yang akan ditampilkan. Framing ini meliputi framing positif dan framing negatif.&#x0D; Kata kunci: perilaku merokok; remaja; psikologi",

Little is known, however, about health habits of recovering alcoholics. We analyzed national survey data to describe the health habits of recovering alcoholics compared with heavy drinkers (four or more drinks per day). Recovering alcoholics had a significantly elevated odds of using seat belts regularly and reporting preventive health practices that are known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, recovering alcoholics were at significantly decreased odds of being cigarette smokers. Although the cross-sectional data have limitations, they indicate there may be more health benefits in recovery from alcoholism than abstinence alone.",

Though the government of India is undertaking measures to reduce tobacco consumption, factors like easy availability, lack of monitoring of tobacco use among youngsters, low cost and rapid absorption into the central nervous system is prompting people from a young age to the elderly to consume tobacco-related products. Legislative measures to reduce tobacco consumption seldom reach or benefit people as laws differ across States.

      "abstract": "By quitting, smokers of all ages can gain substantial health benefits. No other single effort of public health is able to achieve an advantage comparable to smoking cessation on a large scale. However, conventional approaches to smoking cessation require tobacco users to completely abstain, and many smokers are unable - or have not the willingness - to achieve this goal, and then continue to smoke despite the looming negative consequences for health. But it is possible to consider another option: the reduction of harm caused by tobacco smoking (tobacco harm reduction) through the intake of nicotine from alternative sources safer than tobacco smoke, such as the electronic cigarette (e-cig). It is a promising product for the reduction of harm caused by tobacco smoking. In addition to providing nicotine through the vapour without the typical toxic and carcinogenic substances derived from combustion, the e-cig is also a good substitute for the rituals associated with the behaviour of the smoker. In this article, the author suggests that the wide dissemination of vaping behaviour can become a successful strategy to reduce smoking and preventing smoking-related diseases, advancing on how to succeed with this matter.",

The vast majority of psychiatrists treating depressed patients do not target or treat nicotine dependence, and many inpatient psychiatric facilities implicitly condone smoking by providing 'smoke breaks'. The reasons for failure to treat are unclear, but are probably linked to the notion that depressed smokers are neither willing nor able to quit, and will become more depressed if they try. We review the clinical evidence on depression and smoking cessation, and find little support for current psychiatric practice. Although quitting smoking does appear to pose a risk for the development of depression, this risk is not clearly higher in those with a past history of depression than those without. Depressed smokers are as capable as nondepressed smokers of quitting smoking, and at least one-quarter of depressed smokers is willing to try. Sustained abstinence may even lead to improvement in depressive disorders. More research is needed to understand the relationship between depression and quitting smoking, but current clinical evidence suggests more resiliency among depressed smokers than common clinical wisdom would dictate.",

      "title": "Eating habits and appetite control: a psychobiological perspective",
      "abstract": "An individual's eating behaviour is shaped by factors ranging from economic conditions and cultural practices to biological influences. The physiological system controlling appetite appears to be adapted to solving the problem of an unevenness of food supply across time, and is fairly permissive in its response to undereating and overeating. Consequently, when food is abundant, the diet is energy dense and energy expenditure is low, there is a strong tendency to become obese (i.e. obesity is better viewed as due to a ‘toxic’ environment than to faulty physiological control of appetite). Under such conditions the most common method of avoiding obesity is through the cognitive control of eating. However, dietary restraint and dieting are demanding tasks, and are associated with psychological costs, including significant impairment of cognitive performance. Restraint is also prone to disinhibition, with the result that it can sometimes undermine eating control, even leading to the development of highly disordered eating patterns. In part, these difficulties are due to the self-perpetuating nature of dietary habits: for example, hunger tends to be diminished during strict unbroken dieting, but increased in individuals having a highly variable eating pattern (such as occurs when eating is frequently disinhibited). These features of appetite control provide both barriers and opportunities for changing behaviour. Accordingly, there is a need for future research to focus on the psycho-social factors and the dieting practices predicting successful eating and weight control, with the objective of identifying the actual cognitive and behavioural strategies used by the many dieters and restrained eaters who are able to achieve weight loss and maintain long-term weight stability.",

Alcohol forms part of our cultural culture and, in general, an excessive permissiveness to the consumption -even an abusive one- of alcoholic drinks is to be observed. But, at the same time, everything redolent of alcoholism is rejected. On the one hand, there is an endeavour to bestow a nutritive value, even to protecting one’s health, on beer and wine in particular, and on the other, a significant social rejection of abuse is to be seen although there are difficulties in defining what abuse signifies. False popular beliefs that give alcohol a stimulant, calorific and nutritive function and with the ability to provide strength and to increase sexual appetite still persist. Important publicity campaigns with more or less concealed economic interests assist in maintaining these ideas. Alcoholic beverages continue to preoccupy politicians and professionals more that the general public who feel it to be one instrument more in their lives, associated most of all with times of relaxation, fun, company or solitude.",

Contrary to the common belief that it is a safer method of tobacco intake than cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco smoke composition is known to contain significant quantities of harmful toxicants akin to cigarette smoke composition. Studies on the long-term health effects of waterpipe tobacco smoking, although of low quality in these early research stages, suggest significant morbidity and mortality is associated with its use. Cessation outcomes are promising although more work is needed to develop and test waterpipe-specific interventions. The waterpipe industry remains largely unregulated and threatens to undermine existing tobacco control policies.

Substance use in our society is common and can have a direct impact on one's physical and mental health. Substance misuse has been identified as a leading cause of chronic medical and mental health conditions. The etiology of substance use is complex. It occurs on a spectrum from abstinence to severe and disordered use. Comprehensive treatment is needed to address the multilayered biopsychosocial issues that hinder recovery from substance use problems. This chapter will discuss lifestyle medicine-based strategies for improving the well-being of individuals who use substances, including motivational interviewing, harm reduction interventions, counseling, diet, and exercise therapies. Motivational interviewing is an effective technique to help an individual move through stages of change toward abstinence. Harm reduction interventions seek to reduce risk associated with substance use and may be useful for individuals as they work toward abstinence. Diet, exercise, group or individual therapies, and other nonpharmacologic modalities can be effective in addressing substance use and its multilayered etiologies.",

While clients may be overly focused about the consequence of weight gain, over time they may come to value recovery from other consequences even more than weight loss. Research shows extensive consequences from chronic use of processed foods. Although the pathology is distressing, educating clients about the link between compulsive chronic consumption of processed foods and relief from so many conditions can create a positive attitude toward recovery. Probing for the extensive consequences of food addiction motivates clients to start recovery and stay with it. Gently guiding clients through the process of uncovering the extent of consequences may be distressing, but as the myriad of conditions moves into remission clients can be reinforced in their determination to stick to a program of recovery.",

      "abstract": "Although the prevalence of smoking among alcoholics ranges up to 97%, little is known about mechanisms underlying the co‐occurrence of smoking and alcohol use, or the role tobacco may play in alcohol treatment recovery. Adult male alcoholics in treatment ( n = 30) were randomly assigned to visual and olfactory exposure either to alcohol cues or to control cues, and then were allowed to smoke while continuing visual exposure to the same cues. Exposure to alcohol cues resulted in significantly greater self‐reported urge to drink and urge to smoke but had no significant effect on the topography of smoking behavior. When variance due to urge to smoke was controlled, greater urge to drink correlated negatively with number of cigarette puffs. The results provide some support for a priming hypothesis of tobacco's role on alcoholism recovery. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Drugs are surrounded by an aura of myths. They are associated with various cults, ideologies, social movements and – unfortunately – pathologies. Humanity has been familiar with psychoactive substances for time immemorial but the functions of these substances have changed over the years. This change has been increasingly dynamic of late. Within the last few decades not only has the model of drug taking changed but also young people’s attitudes towards the substances. Most noteworthy is the evolution that has taken place in the model of drug taking. Nowadays the practice is not limited, as it used to be, to narrow circles of recognisably pathological youngsters but has spread to pupils, students and young men and women who have completed their education and joined the work force, who treat some of the substances as a no less popular element of their daily lives than alcohol. This state of affairs has been brought about to a considerable extent by the changes which are taking place on the drug market itself and by the quantum change in attitudes towards psychoactive substances. The model of functioning of people who take drugs has also changed. Previously, drugs were not taken on an occasional basis but were part of a permanent drug culture. Those who took drugs formed tight-knitted communities. Now, however, young people often take drugs spontaneously, occasionally, almost on the spur of the moment, without being associated with any specific social margin. Youngsters’ enormous receptivity to soft drugs and the constant presence of marihuana in their cultural activities has “habituated” them to the problems of drug dependence and led them to feel that they can take drugs and still belong to the drug-free community.",

Frequent cannabis use, especially when first used before the age of 16 years, is associated with addiction, poor mental health, impaired memory and learning, reduced educational attainment, in addition to social and legal difficulties. Despite the harms associated with cannabis use, dependent cannabis users are less likely to present for treatment than other illicit drug users and problematic cannabis use is rarely detected by health professionals. It is important that clinicians regularly include screening and assessment of cannabis use and account for cannabis use in case formulations. This paper will outline the prevalence of cannabis use, its associated harms, diagnostic considerations, and a brief review of best-practice treatment.",

At the highest levels of competitive sports, where athletes strain to improve performances already at the limits of human ability, the temptation to use a drug that might provide an edge can be powerful. Many athletes persist in using performance-enhancing drugs despite official disapproval, possible disqualification, and even risk to their own health. They do so in the face of expert opinion, which casts doubt on the effectiveness of the drugs they take. Reasons commonly given to limit liberty fall into three classes: those that claim that the practice interferes with capacities for rational choice; those that emphasize harms to self; and those that emphasize harms to others. The case of performance-enhancing drugs and sport illustrates a fourth reason that may justify some interference with liberty, a phenomenon we can call \"inherent coerciveness.\"",

      "abstract": "Despite decades of nutrition, obesity, and diabetes research, and worsening prevalences and severities of virtually every chronic metabolic disease, the scientific community remains divided over the existence and veracity of the concept of food addiction. There are numerous rationalizations — 1) you need food to survive, (of which “Food is Medicine” is the latest mantra); 2) people with obesity should not be stigmatized as “mentally ill”; 3) people with obesity should instead adhere to “personal responsibility”; 4) the data are incomplete and not strong enough; 5) it’s correlation but not causation; 6) everyone is exposed, but not everyone is addicted; 7) there is no “withdrawal” phenotype; and 8) it’s not “food addiction” but “eating addiction”. All are in play, yet more health care dollars are diverted to the treatment of food-related disease every year. While various ingestible chemicals (e.g. nicotine, cocaine, heroin, alcohol) are clearly addictive, it appears to be a stretch by some scientists to argue that individual substances found in food (e.g. sugar, caffeine), or the food itself (e.g. ultraprocessed food), rise to meet the same criteria. Symposia on food addiction proliferate and journal debates continue. The definition of addiction consists of numerous criteria, including public health demographics, biochemistry, imaging, animal trials, clinical trials, and economics. None of these have proven to be “slam dunks” to align a general consensus. But paramount for scientific acceptance is the delineation of mechanism. This article will review the history of the controversy, the data on which foods are most likely to be addictive, the two mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of food addiction and relate it to the most likely culprits, and the role of the food industry in promulgating false narratives, in order to provide a rational way forward from this debate.",

They are designed to contain a solution which is heated to produce an aerosol inhaled by the user. The liquid is mainly composed of propylene glycol, glycerol, flavours and, in some cases, nicotine. Except for nicotine, which can be fatal when ingested at high dose, these components are generally considered as safe. However, the potential effect of long term exposure to inhaled propylene glycol is unknown at this time. As an advantage, toxic compounds responsible for the noxiousness of tobacco smoking (nitrosamines, metals, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide …) are either absent, or present in the smoke of e-cigarette at levels far less compared to conventional cigarette smoke. Finally, efficacy of e-cigarette as a tool for smoking cessation stays to be proven.La cigarette électronique, aussi appelée e-cigarette, est présentée comme une alternative au tabagisme qui serait moins nocive pour la santé.

Kebiasaan merokok dianggap dapat memberikan kenikmatan bagi perokok, namun di lain pihak dapat menimbulkan dampak buruk bagi perokok sendiri maupun orang-orang disekitarnya. Berbagai kandungan zat yang terdapat di dalam rokok memberikan dampak negatif pada tubuh penghisapnya. Sekarang ini kegiatan merokok juga banyak dilakukan oleh remaja yang biasanya dilakukan di depan orang lain, terutama dilakukan di depan kelompoknya karena mereka sangat tertatik kepada kelompok sebayanya atau dengan kata lain terikat dengan kelompoknya. Hal ini sebenarnya telah diketahui oleh remaja khususnya dan umumnya masyarakat dunia, bahwa merokok itu mengganggu kesehatan. Masalah rokok pada hakekatnya sudah menjadi masalah nasional,bahkan internasional. Pemerintah tentunya juga tidak tinggal diam atas fenomena banyaknya kebiasaan merokok pada kalangan masyarakat,khususnya kalangan remaja yang masih berstatus pelajar. Selain kebijakan-kebijakan pemerintah akan larangan merokok diberbagai tempat umum seperti rumah sakit, di kantor-kantor, lingkungan sekolahan, serta tempat umum lainnya tentunya pemerintah juga mengeluarkan peraturan yang sah seperti 3HUDWXUDQ 3HPHULQWDK 5, 1RPRU 7DKXQ WHQWDQJ ³3HQJDPDQDQ 5RNRN %DJL.HVHKDWDQ¥\\DQJGLNeluarkan resmi oleh Presiden.

Termasuk dalam hal ini para pelajar SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar. Dari kondisi itulah maka dalam penelitian ini akan mengangkat topik dan masalah penelitian tentang perilaku merokok pada kalangan pelajar di SMA Negeri 2 Karanganyar.

Osnovni principi lijecenja su isti, ali postoje razlike i specificnosti alkoholizma žena. Naime, u dijagnosticiranju i lijecenju alkoholizma kod žena ukljuceno je mnogo skrivanja, prikrivanja, racionalizacija te stida, kako kod osobe koja se treba lijeciti tako i kod obitelji ciji je ta osoba clan (2). \n\nDanas se sve cesce spominje da alkoholizam nije jedinstveni poremecaj, vec skupina poremecaja koji se po uzroku međusobno razlikuju. Uzroci alkoholizma leže, prije svega, u samom covjeku, a zatim u njegovoj bližoj ili siroj okolini. Stoga, suvremeni pristup alkoholizmu podrazumijeva sveobuhvatne programe prevencije, rane dijagnostike, lijecenja i rehabilitacije. Postoje razni programi lijecenja alkoholizma, od stacionarnog lijecenja u intenzivnoj skrbi i na odjelu, preko dnevne i vikend bolnice, parcijalnih oblika bolnickog lijecenja, do ambulantnog lijecenja u vise obiteljskih skupina i drugim ambulantnim terapijskim postupcima te u klubovima lijecenih alkoholicara. \nPosljedice alkoholizma na organizam mogu biti razlicite: promjene na koži (prosirene žilice, otoci itd.), bolesti srca, gusterace, jetre, perifernog živcanog sustava, neuroloske bolesti, smetnje osjeta, snage i koordinacije pokreta. Prisutne su i dusevne posljedice kao poremecaj ponasanja, razne vrste sumanutosti, delirija, halucinacije, ljubomore te na kraju i demencije. Alkoholizam je javno – zdravstveno - socijalni problem, a osnova lijecenja alkoholicara je jacanje njihove motivacije za apstinencijom i promjenom nacina života te poticanje samo odgovornosti za uspjeh lijecenja, cime se sprjecava povratak obrascu ponasanja koji je bio prisutan tijekom pijenja. Pristup je individualan i timski, gdje razni kadrovi svojim znanjem, sposobnoscu i vjestinama pridonose kvalitetnijem i sigurnijem lijecenju alkoholicara, ukljucujuci obitelj te ostale srodne profile ako ima potreba za njima.",

These permits are issued for many different occasions and are most common in the provinces with the highest per capita alcohol consumption. Special permit drinking is becoming a social and alcohol-control issue but information on the problems it creates is sparse. Specific problem areas such as excessive drinking and drinking by minors have not been studied, but because such drinking is rarely monitored they may be substantial. Further study of special permit drinking is recommended.",

      "title": "Emerging Trend of Waterpipe use in Saudi Arabia.",
      "abstract": "Annually the tobacco epidemic kills more than 5 million people globally, one person die prematurely every six seconds in the world. In Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about 30,000 people die every year because of smoking associated diseases. (1)\r\n\r\nThe waterpipe (WP) is known in different cultures with different names as Shisha, Hubble-bubble, Hookhah, Goza and Nargghile etc. It is centuries old tobacco use method which is witnessing a worldwide surge in popularity. Water pipe is widely used in Middle East, Northern Africa and in some parts of Asia and it is gaining popularity in some Western countries. In some Arab countries less stigma is associated with water pipe than cigarette smoking.(2)\r\n\r\nMany factors have contributed to recent waterpipe wide spread use, including sweetened and flavored waterpipe tobacco, its reduced harm perception, the thriving cafe culture & restaurants. The passage of smoke through water is one of the reasons for common misperception that waterpipe use is less harmful than cigarettes. Actually health effects are influenced by type of tobacco, frequency and duration of use, volume of smoke inhaled and other factors. (3)\r\n\r\nWater pipe smoking is gaining popularity particularly in Gulf region. Its smoke contain harmful constituents which linked to variety of life threatening conditions including pulmonary diseases, coronary heart diseases, cancers and pregnancy related complications.(4) Approximately three quarters of female university students in Egypt prefer smoking tobacco via a water pipe than smoking cigarettes because they believe it is less harmful. Water pipe users are at greater risk as they are exposed to greater overall amounts of nicotine, carbon monoxide and other toxins.(5)\r\n\r\nWaterpipe smoking has adverse effects on general health and predispose to oral cancers. A positive correlation between lip and buccal cancers and WP smoking is proved. (6)\r\n\r\nA study was carried out among 1,652 secondary students aged 15–19 years of both genders in Al Hass region of Saudi Arabia. Water pipe was used by 53.9%. Of the regular water pipe smokers 20.7% smoked on daily basis and 23.8% on weekly basis. Primary motive of WP use were outing with friends, for company and to avoid boredom. (7)\r\n\r\nA similar study conducted among selected schools students (13 to 15 years age) of Al Kharaj region of Saudi Arabia indicates 20 percent students were current smokers and 16% were ex smokers; influence of friends and smoking in family were important factors among current smokers.(8)\r\n\r\nAnalysis of nicotine content of 13 commercial brands of waterpipe tobacco was carried out using gas chromatography at toxicology Laboratory; University of Jordan revealed that W P smokers are not at lesser risk than cigarettes smokers in relation to nicotine dependence. The inability of water to trap significant amount chemical substances present in tobacco (especially nicotine), and danger of combustion of additives like; glycerine, honey, and other flavors could be important factors to extrapolate the damage resulting from waterpipe smoking. (9)\r\n\r\nA study revealed that the prevalence of WP smoking in school students in the Kingdom ranged between 12 to 30 percent, which generally rose up to 37% in university students. High proportion of water pipe smokers among students might possibly reflect high socioeconomic status as highly educated parents might consider W P smoking a modern standard of living. WP use is increasing among women of different age groups also, including 14 percent of school girls, 11 percent of female university students and 16 % of female doctors. Other community groups as military personnel 30.5 percent and 15 percent of rural and desert inhabitants. (10)\r\n\r\nSocial acceptability, poor knowledge of water pipe related health hazards and certain socio demographic characters are favoring the increasing current trend of water pipe use in Saudi Arabia. There is an urgent need to promote multi-disciplinary health education activities at different age groups in order to prevent adolescent and younger age from all type of smoking especially current trend of W P smoking, and to help smokers to quit.\r\n\r\nPrevention and cessation of WP includes discouraging adolescents and adults who have never smoked, expanding legislation on water pipe cafe and banning on pro-tobacco advertising and sponsorship, besides all indoor workplaces should be no smoking area. Raising community’s awareness, firm legislation, and high taxation on tobacco products may prove effective. Studies indicate nicotine patches, gums, and nasal sprays containing small doses of nicotine, hypnosis, acupuncture and providing medical support for those wishing to quit are effective measures. Public interventions including laws and regulations smoking cafe and restaurant should be rigorously implemented. (11)",

There was a close relation between drinking of alcoholic beverage and blood pressure but this concerned with men who acquired the habit of drinking by the force of surroundings. Strong tea and coffee, too, had something to do with blood pressure but in this case the surroundings were out of question. 2. Blood pressure was apt to rise with men who took meals hastily but it bad nothing to do with women. 3. Those who were fond of excessively salty or fatty food often suffered from hypertension. 4. Those who were particular about their food were found in the greatest number among the group of extreme hypertension. 5. Hypertension was rarely found among those with constant poor appetite. 6. Hypertension seldom attacked those who had the following complaints: To fall ill occasionally, to be always out of order, to have severe mental fatigue, to feel fatigue every morning, etc. But hereditary weak constitution had nothing to do with hypertension. 7. The blood pressure rose when the time for sleeting was less than 4 hours. It also rose with those who were easily awakened from their sleep or could not enjoy a sound sleep. But it was difficult to find any immediate relations between the failure to sleep readily or to have regular hours for sleep and the blood pressure. 8. Many heavy smokers were found among hypertensives which shows that smoking is the cause of high blood pressure. 9. The blood pressure rose of women whose household operates less than 50 area of farms while in the household with over one hectares, men's pressure rose. This is because in the former case, the stress of labor falls on women while in the latter, men bear the burden. 10.

Ved passiv røyking vil en person kunne få i seg like mye av enkelte stoffer itobakksrøyken som om vedkommende selv hadde røykt opptil flere sigaretter. I artikkelen er det foretatt engjennomgang av publiserte undersøkelser i forbindelse med hjertesykdommer og passiv røyking. Passivrøyking reduserer blodets transport av oksygen til myokard, samt hjertemuskulaturens evne til å brukeoksygenet i dannelsen av adenosintrifosfat (ATP). Passiv røyking øker blodplatenes aktivitet. I dyreforsøker det funnet at tobakksrøyk fremskynder aterosklerotiske skader, samt forsterker vevskaden ved reperfusjon.Ikke-røykere som daglig er utsatt for passiv røyking over lengre tid, har en økt risiko både for dødeligog ikke-dødelig hjertesykdom.

Passive smoking and risk of heart disease. Nor J Epidemiol 1995; 5 (2): 135-140. ENGLISH SUMMARYEnvironmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a complex mixture of a large number of chemical substancesprimarily generated by the incomplete combustion of tobacco. The term passive smoking is used when aperson breathes in air contaminated with ETS. Passive smoking reduces the blood’s ability to deliveroxygen to the myocardium, and reduces the ability of the heart muscle to use oxygen in the formation ofadenosine triphosphate. Passive smoking activates blood platelets. Animal experiments have shown thatETS accelerates the development of atherosclerosis. Nonsmokers exposed to ETS daily for long periodshave an increased risk for fatal and nonfatal heart disease. It is estimated that annually 300-500 (low andhigh estimate, respectively) nonsmokers in Norway die due to heart disease caused by passive smoking",

There is a consensus about adverse effects related to heavy consumption of potential toxic substances, but opinions about mild abuses remain blurred. Zero tolerance public health policies for alcohol or tobacco consumption during pregnancy are difficult to sustain for caregivers, very often embarrassed by anamnestic findings related to mild addictions. How to get this information, how relevant it is and what to do with that are essential questions to answer. For some of the patients, drug abuse is a compensation for psychological difficulties, for others, the use of illicit substance is directly linked to a psychiatric disorders. These difficulties as well as these disorders require correct identification. Communication about risks related to drug abuse is essential but parallel process including analysis of the emotions behind the substance consumption should be performed.",

      "abstract": "Introdução: As mudanças biopsicossociais presentes no envelhecimento, como a aposentadoria, perda de amigos, isolamento social e solidão, podem colocar os idosos em uma situação de vulnerabilidade, viabilizando o consumo abusivo de substâncias psicoativas, tais como o tabaco. Objetivo: descrever a produção científica acerca do hábito do tabagismo entre idosos no Brasil. Métodos: Trata-se de uma revisão integrativa da literatura, com análise das publicações entre os anos de 2001 a 2011 em bases de dados on-line. Resultados: Foram encontradas 25 publicações, contudo poucas específicas sobre a população de idosos. Os estudos mostram que a prevalência de tabagismo atual diminui com o avançar da idade, enquanto a de tabagismo passado aumenta com esta. Há relação inversa do tabagismo com a renda e escolaridade, sendo também mais prevalente entre idosos homens. Além da forte associação do tabagismo entre idosos com a presença de comorbidades de vários sistemas, além do desenvolvimento de câncer, alcoolismo e depressão. Conclusão: Salienta-se a necessidade do desenvolvimento de estudos específicos com a população idosa acerca do hábito do tabagismo, a fim de reconhecer melhor esta situação e dar subsídios para que a rede de apoio a estes idosos possa estar mais preparada para acolhê-los.",

This relationship should be applicable regardless of the route of absorption of dieldrin (ingestion, inhalation, or percutaneous). Forced feeding of a high calorific value food appears to have a place in the treatment of dieldrin poisoning and, by extension, in the treatment of poisoning from many other chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides.",

      "abstract": "This article describes the relationship between the efficacy of drug use and the medical qualifications of the prescriber. Different purposes of drug use are examined: the control of disease; maintenance of desirable normality; and the achievement of desirable supernormality. Drugs are most beneficial when prescribed by a qualified physician under clinical situations. Drugs such as Aspirin, the pill, or vitamin C. are self-administered by the patient, with or without advice from a physician, but tend to lose efficacy as a result of misadministration. Drugs such as alcohol, cannabis and heroin are often self-administered for desirable short term supernormality (e.g. euphoria, reduction of intellectual stress) but with long term detrimental effects. A culture of general drug use is developing in Ireland and Britain.",

The abuse of easily accessible lighter gas butane is increasing among children and adolescants and this abuse causes euphoric effects. Inhalants are the most commonly used drug after alcohol and tobacco among adolescents. In the literature, it is reported that butane inhalation directly affects central nervous system, respiratory and cardiovasculer systems. To prevent this increasing trend, we believe that society, especially youth, should be educated through precautionary educational activities, sales of lighter refill tubes should be monitored and be made age-restricted, and lighter refill tubes should have warning signs that everyone would understand and attract attention. We present a case of the sudden death of a seventeen-year-old male due to inhaling butane containing lighter refill gas with friends along with the autopsy findings and the results of toxicology and histopathology investigations.",

      "abstract": "Although there is no doubt that smokers switching to electronic cigarettes (EC) substantially reduce the risk to their health, some tobacco control activists and health organisations discourage smokers from using EC and lobby policy makers to reduce EC use by draconian regulation.The hostility to EC may be related to a moral belief that nicotine use should be eradicated rather than allowed to morph into a relatively harmless activity. If EC are allowed to compete with cigarettes and develop further, smoking is likely to all but disappear. Discouraging smokers from making the switch and reducing EC competitiveness with cigarettes by unwarranted regulation will delay this opportunity or squander it altogether.In fact, there is now sufficient evidence available for health professionals to recommend to smokers who cannot stop smoking with existing treatments or do not want to do so, to try several types of e-cigarettes to see if they can find one meeting their needs.",

A “fissura”, por sua vez, e uma necessidade urgente, fisica e psiquica, do dependente quimico de utilizar a substância a qual e adicto, que combinada a fatores de risco, pode levar o ex-usuario a “recaida”, ou seja, retorno ao uso da substância. A recaida e considerada um estado de crise caracterizado pelo uso de substância apos periodo de abstinencia, e e um acontecimento que mesmo inconscientemente e programado pelo dependente, concretizando-se no momento que este consome a substância.

      "abstract": "Since their introduction to the European beverage industry 25 years ago and to the United States more than 10 years ago, energy drinks have been gaining popularity, especially among adolescent and young adult consumers. Currently, there are over 300 different energy drinks on the market [1], with new beverages being added regularly. Energy drinks are widely touted for their ability to increase energy levels and enhance cognitive and athletic performance. By promoting this aspect, the consumer marketing of energy drinks frequently targets the 18–35-year-old demographic. With popular lore conveying the expectation that caffeine will counteract the sedating effects of alcohol, energy drinks have become increasingly popular to mix with alcohol, especially in young adults. This is demonstrated by a survey revealing that, of college students who had consumed alcohol in the last 30 days, almost one-quarter reported doing so in combination with an energy drink [2]. Despite the frequency of use, there are several concerns regarding the consumption of energy drinks mixed with alcohol including increased absorption of alcohol, drinking higher volumes of alcohol per drinking session and drinking alcohol more frequently, decreased awareness of alcohol-related impairment, and increased rates of alcohol-related consequences.",

El problema se va complicando hasta que logra una dimensión colosal, lo cual conlleva a que los gobiernos y las organizaciones multilaterales convoquen convenciones internacionales como la de Nueva York en 1961 y Viena en 1971 para desarrollar, no solo un discurso, sino también una posición política que proclama la preocupación de las naciones por la “salud física y moral de la humanidad”, a su vez que se comprometen a prevenir y combatir el mal de la toxicomanía.",

      "abstract": "Passive exposure to tobacco smoke significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in children. Children, in particular, seem to be the most susceptible population to the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Paternal smoking inside the home leads to significant maternal and fetal exposure to ETS and may subsequently affect fetal health. ETS has been associated with adverse effects on pediatric health, including preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal mortality, respiratory illness, neurobehavioral problems, and decreased performance in school. A valid estimation of the risks associated with tobacco exposure depends on accurate measurement. Nicotine and its major metabolite, cotinine, are commonly used as smoking biomarkers, and their levels can be determined in various biological specimens such as blood, saliva, and urine. Recently, hair analysis was found to be a convenient, noninvasive technique for detecting the presence of nicotine exposure. Because nicotine/cotinine accumulates in hair during hair growth, it is a unique measure of long-term, cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke. Although smoking ban policies result in considerable reductions in ETS exposure, children are still exposed significantly to tobacco smoke not only in their homes but also in schools, restaurants, child-care settings, cars, buses, and other public places. Therefore, more effective strategies and public policies to protect preschool children from ETS should be consolidated. Key words: Tobacco smoke pollution, Nicotine, Cotinine, Child, Hair",

      "abstract": "For thousands of years, humans have been using substances that are called 'drugs' today, for example to relieve pain, to relax, to gain energy, or in the course of cultural and religious rituals. In search for explanations as to why so many people in the 21st century use drugs, and why in such a wide variety, several macro level factors or drivers need to be addressed.Chapters in this volume contribute to the understanding of drug use, drug users, drug markets and drug policy in Europe. All the authors work in this field, and are involved in local, national or international research on drug use, drug users or drug dealers. Their research is not carried out in laboratories nor treatment centres. Some of it is predominantly conducted in libraries and archives, but most takes place elsewhere - on the streets, in nightclubs, in private drug-dealing settings. The authors are social scientists from different disciplines - anthropology, criminology, geography, economics, linguistics, psychology, sociology, social psychiatry - and many of them have an interest in, or are specifically oriented to qualitative research methods, including participant observation, informal conversations and in-depth interviews. In the search for explanations as to why particular groups turn to or continue to use certain substances over others, why some people use drugs, why users prefer particular methods of supply, and why current drug policies exists, each of the chapters underline the utmost importance of this book, which captures many of the complexities of how drug use and drug dealing is explained, experienced and often problematised today.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of a food typically leads to a decrease in its subsequent intake through habituation--a decrease in one's responsiveness to the food and motivation to obtain it. We demonstrated that habituation to a food item can occur even when its consumption is merely imagined. Five experiments showed that people who repeatedly imagined eating a food (such as cheese) many times subsequently consumed less of the imagined food than did people who repeatedly imagined eating that food fewer times, imagined eating a different food (such as candy), or did not imagine eating a food. They did so because they desired to eat it less, not because they considered it less palatable. These results suggest that mental representation alone can engender habituation to a stimulus.

It kills. It kills people at work and mostly on the road where it has become one of the main factors of insecurity. It's actually causing one third of road accidents. Drunk drivers constitute a phenomenon which has attracted the attention of public authorities for a long time. This attention is exemplitied by the laudable interventions of the legislator who prompts drivers to sobriety and, should the case arise, punishes their intemperance. So, driving under the effect of alcohol is forbidden and it constitutes two offences : driving under the influence of an alcoholic state and driving in a state of drunkenness. If this second state, which is obvious for every person is quite plain and does not require any special kind of evidence, on the other hand, the first state requires that the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood should be mesured scientificaly before any proceedings are taken against him. So, some medical, clinical and biological confirmation is the evidence to be shown. In this way, we shall have to study the facts which cause responsability, their evidence and their sanctions.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the topic of the presented study lies in the fact that the problem of a healthy lifestyle in the modern world is quite popular. In terms of this problem, the penitentiary system is no exception, since in order to achieve the most effective results of the performance of employees, the lifestyle they lead plays an important role. The surveys showed that the vast majority of employees of the above system do not adhere to proper nutrition, do not engage in physical training, which is especially important from a certain age, and 80% of them are smokers. The author concludes that the physical training of penitentiary staff is directly influenced by such factors as nutrition, smoking and maintaining physical fitness at a high level. A system of measures is needed that includes such rules for a balanced diet, strengthening physical condition through regular physical activity, and they should consist of both general developmental workouts that involve the largest number of muscles, and certain types of training aimed at increasing the level of self-defense, for example, study and improvement of combat techniques of struggle; giving up bad habits such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. If a set of events with specialists invited to work on healthy lifestyles in each specific institution will work like clockwork, then the level of physical fitness of employees will remain at a high level, which is extremely important when working with convicts.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays the number of obese people is growing. Simultaneously, we can observe an increase in the availability of dietary services, reduction diets or various types of low-calorie food. What are the reasons for that? So far obesity and its consequences have been described in terms of somatic diseases. However, the psychological issue was ignored. Currently, we can observe a significant increase in the researcher’s interest in the psychological sphere of obese people. Excessive weight cannot be seen only as a consequence of the increased calorie intake. It is also the result of trained mechanisms of coping with stress, anxiety disorders, or as a result of low self-esteem and effectiveness. Probably people function in such a way because the word has changed its function. It does not just provide food and energy. It has become a way of expressing feelings, spending time and coping with emotions. Eating meals fits in many aspects of human functioning, including a family aspect, a business aspect or a social one. High availability of food and the omnipresence of restaurants contribute to the fact that people easier grab meals, regardless of whether they need them or not. In some cases food is a way to get rid of boredom or the way of spending time. Certain features of temperament and personality are characteristic for obese people. In addition, recently more and more psychiatric disorders associated with obesity have been distinguished. Available diagnostic methods and knowledge on the mechanisms of these anomalies allow to their differentiation. We can distinguish the following disorders: binge eating disorder, night eating syndrome, stress eating, sleep eating disorders and others.",

      "title": "Spelen met gezondheid. Leefstijl en psychische gezondheid van de Nederlandse jeugd",
      "abstract": "Vergeleken met circa tien jaar geleden is het aantal rokers en cannabisgebruikers onder jongeren licht gedaald en is het condoomgebruik toegenomen. Negatieve trends zijn de toename van overgewicht en alcoholgebruik. Psychische problemen komen relatief veel bij jongeren voor, maar zijn in de afgelopen twintig jaar nauwelijks toegenomen. Dit blijkt uit een RIVM-rapport over leefstijl (roken, alcoholgebruik, overgewicht, cannabisgebruik en riskant seksueel gedrag) en psychische problemen (emotionele problemen en gedragsproblemen) onder de Nederlandse jeugd. De gezondheid van de jeugd van 0 tot en met 18 jaar is over het algemeen goed. De ongezonde leefstijl van jongeren kan echter leiden tot ongezondheid; op de korte termijn, maar vooral op latere leeftijd. Daarom is preventie belangrijk. Preventieve interventies moeten een combinatie zijn van gedragsbeinvloeding van de jongere zelf en maatregelen gericht op een gezonde leefomgeving. Bovendien moet de aanpak meerdere ongezonde leefstijlfactoren omvatten, zoals roken, drinken en riskant seksueel gedrag, omdat deze vaak bij dezelfde jongeren voorkomen. Ongezonde leefstijlfactoren en psychische problemen komen vaker voor onder laagopgeleide jongeren. Jongeren op het VMBO vormen een omvangrijke en belangrijke doelgroep om de geschetste problemen te voorkomen. De relatie tussen etniciteit enerzijds en een ongezonde leefstijl en psychische problemen anderzijds is niet eenduidig.",

Normally the body might use cytokines to trigger a fever of inflammatory response to battle infection leading to unpleasant effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue and hormonal imbalance in the body. Dehydration is believed to be the cause of hangover as it leads to anti diuresis state in the body. The most compelling theory that, at the moment, is that hangover results from a buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic compound in the body. The congener amount in the particular alcoholic beverage is believed to be increase the extent of severity of hangover. Methanol, found in highest levels in whiskey and red wine has received a larger amount of blame for showing that it can linger in the body after all alcohol has been eliminated, perhaps accounting for the enduring effects of hangover.",

      "title": "Marijuana",
      "abstract": "Marijuana (cannabis), the illicit drug used most frequently in the United States, may be smoked in cigarettes (joints, nails, reefers), pipes (bongs, bowls), or cigars (blunts); mixed with food; or brewed as a tea. Hashish (hash), a potent resin of cannabis, also may be used as a sticky black liquid (hash oil). Other street terms are pot, herb, weed, grass, widow, and ganja.The 2010 Monitoring the Future study, which assesses adolescent substance use patterns, revealed that admitted lifetime marijuana use among eighth, 10th, and 12th graders in the United States was 17.3%, 33.4%, and 43.8%, respectively; daily use was 1.2%, 3.3%, and 6.1%, respectively. Trends in use have varied in recent decades.The primary active chemical in marijuana is THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Increased cultivation of sinsemilla made from buds of female cannabis plants has raised mean THC content from 0.7% in the 1970s to 8.5% in 2008, with wide variability in dose. Street marijuana also may be contaminated with a variety of other drugs, toxins, and infectious agents.After smoking marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs to the bloodstream and brain, where it binds to cannabinoid receptors. Euphoria and other brain effects occur within seconds of smoking, peak in 15 to 30 minutes, and taper over 2 to 3 hours. The onset of action after oral ingestion is 30 to 90 minutes, with peak effect in 2 to 3 hours and a duration of 4 to 12 hours. THC is highly lipid-soluble and has a serum half-life of ∼19 hours.Physiologic effects include transient tachycardia for up to 3 hours, increased sitting blood pressure with abnormal orthostatic responses, and peripheral vasodilation. Regular marijuana smoking may cause respiratory effects similar to those caused by tobacco, including daily cough, more frequent lung infections, exacerbation of asthma, decreased pulmonary function, and increased risk of respiratory tract cancer. Marijuana smoke contains 50% to 70% more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke, and marijuana users typically inhale more deeply and longer, increasing carcinogen exposure. Cannabis may reduce immune function, and heavy use causes reversible decreases in sperm count and motility in animals. Irregular ovulation also has been noted. Short-term behavioral effects include memory and learning deficits, distorted sensory and time perception, problem-solving difficulties, and impaired coordination. Heavy marijuana use may exacerbate depression, anxiety, personality disorders, and sleep disturbance. There may be negative effects on intellectual, employment, and social skills. Memory impairment may last up to 1 month after last use. Students using marijuana have lower high school grades and graduation rates than do nonusing peers.Marijuana increases the risk of injury, unwanted and unprotected sex, and other drug use. Recreational doses impair driving as much as blood alcohol concentrations of 0.07% to 0.1%. No deleterious effects of marijuana use on the fetus have been confirmed.Long-term marijuana use may lead to addiction, with use continuing despite interference with family life, school, work, and recreation. Tolerance may occur after several days of regular use. Withdrawal symptoms after heavy use peak by day 4 and resolve by 2 weeks. These symptoms include irritability, insomnia, malaise, drug craving, diaphoresis, night sweats, gastrointestinal disturbances, and agitation.Screening for drug use and addictive symptoms is part of comprehensive adolescent care. Anticipatory guidance should include information about marijuana's addictive potential; injury risk; and possible impairment of learning, socialization, and sexual function. Parents should be encouraged to rehearse strategies to help teenagers avoid drug-using settings. Skills-based interventions in schools have helped increase drug knowledge, decision-making, self-esteem, and peer pressure resistance and have led to reduced marijuana use. Interventions in nonschool settings, motivational interviewing, and some family interventions also may help prevent marijuana use.Marijuana and its metabolites are detectable in urine by enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique starting 1 hour after smoking. The urine assay usually remains positive up to 10 days after infrequent use and up to 30 days in heavy users. Some urine tests may detect passive inhalation of second-hand marijuana smoke. False-positive results may occur from ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; false-negative results may follow urine dilution or adulteration. Various urine and saliva tests as well as adulterants to modify the tests are available on the Internet. Care must be taken to avoid contamination, dilution, or substitution when obtaining urine samples for testing.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports voluntary confidential drug testing to ensure that adolescents seek care. Although parents may ask a physician to test their teenagers for evidence of drug use, the AAP states: “Testing adolescents requires their consent unless (1) a patient lacks decision-making capacity; or (2) there are strong medical indications or legal requirements to do so.” Although recent court decisions allow schools to perform random drug tests on middle and high school students participating in extracurricular activities, the AAP has opposed school-based testing unless part of a funded, comprehensive approach to addressing substance abuse.Comment: Some of the most challenging encounters I have experienced have involved parents asking for drug testing for their adolescent children. Working toward a trusting relationship between the adolescent and parent is critical, and negotiating these situations has been enhanced by the AAP statement on this topic: that the drug-testing procedure should be done with the adolescent’s consent, and positive results should be used as a mechanism to get treatment for the patient, not punishment. Facilitating this dialogue and helping the adolescent patient know that both family and pediatrician have his or her best interests in mind are essential.Much controversy has arisen over legalizing marijuana use. Those who are opposed worry that access will be easier for children and adolescents and enhance unwanted drug use. Those who are in favor think that the therapeutic potential of pain relief, increase in appetite, and nausea control could be beneficial for select patients with AIDS, cancer, and multiple sclerosis. More research is needed to determine the best way to approach this public health issue in controlling distribution to those who would benefit medically while minimizing risk from recreational use.",

This report details the interrelationships between adolescence, smoking, and nutrition and health. Current data indicate that most smokers become nicotine-dependent as adolescents, which places them at risk for chronic diseases associated with continuous oxidative damage. Additionally, nicotine has antidepressant and hypermetabolic effects, which may be of particular importance during adolescence because nicotine use leads to increased dependence on tobacco, contributes to difficulty in smoking cessation, and promotes weight gain following smoking cessation.",

Anahtar Kelimeler : Sigara, St. Mutans, Laktobasil, Tukuruk akis hizi ABSTRACT It is known that low flow rate of saliva, high amount of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, is active in formation and advance of cavities. The objective of this study is to research the relation between smoking and the flow rate of the saliva also the amount of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli among dental faculty students of ages between 21 and 26. For the study, two groups of 25 individuals each are formed among the students of Aegean University Dentistry Faculty. Group A consists of non-smokers who have never smoked before. Group B is selected as smoking group which smokes at least 3 years and has divided into two as Group B1 abd B2. Group B1 consists of individuals, who are smoking 10 or less cigarettes per day. Group B2 consists of individuals, who are smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day. After the clinical mouth examinings, the DMFT index of the individuals are decided. It has been taken care that the avarage DMFT values of the individuals in the studygroups are close to each other. The stimulated saliva samples of the mentioned studygroups are taken. First the flow rate, then the mutans steptococci and lactobacilli amounts of the stimulated salivas are calculated. In statistical analysis of the obtained data, Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests are used. The results are evaluated with the significance level of p<0,05. According to the result of the statistical assessments, smoking among dental faculty students of ages 21-26, has no statistical significant relation with flow rate of the saliva, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli values. In the case of regular oral hygene habit, the effect of smoking on the flow rate of the saliva, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli numbers has been evaluated. With the result of this study, it has been concluded that smoking does not have a statistical significant effect on the flow rate of the saliva, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli values for the individuals, processing regular and aware oral hygiene care. It is being believed that, in the case of regular oral hygene habit, smoking has no effect in formation of cavities. But the case for a longer time period smoking should be researched.

      "abstract": "Introduction: and objective: E-cigarettes -an entity, unheard of until a few years ago, has taken up the market in a big way. They are being aggressively marketed all over the world, are being increasingly used by smokers as well as new vapers because of its easy availability and no regulation on its sale or use. These gadgets come in nearly 250 varieties and are being frequently upgraded. Methods: The promoters of e-cigs claim that it exposes the user and persons around them to much lesser degrees of nicotine and other chemicals, which is definitely far less toxic then the cigarette smoke. It is less likely to cause the health hazards-mainly cardiovascular, cancer and lung diseases as compared with cigarettes. However, no detail study has been done to clearly show the amount of nicotine absorbed and the health hazards of these noncombustibles, toxic substances have been found to be present in e-cig vapors, but again the level is very low. Results: People are worried, that this may become a starting point, the gateway of smoking for the young generation. The youngsters are easily attracted to newer, cool things and with no regulation on its advertisements, the use among youth is definitely going up. Down the line these people just remain e-cig user or easily switch to smoking cigarettes, only the time will tell. But the likelihood of this is very high. Many are using cigarettes and e-cigarettes in tandem. Conclusions: Unlicensed, unregulated e-cigarettes fail to meet standards of safety, quality and efficacy and therefore health professionals in India, as of now, do not recommend e-cigs for quitting.",

All forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) – gum, patches and inhaler – and bupropion are safe and effective for increasing smoking cessation rates in the short and long-term use. Combination NRT (more than one therapy) may be indicated in patients who have failed monotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Apart from evidence on the acute effects of passive smoking, there is relatively little information available on whether breathing other people's smoke at work causes disease. However, exposure does commonly occur at work, and it does not differ qualitatively from passive smoking occurring in other settings. Therefore it appears sensible to extrapolate from what is known about health risks in settings such as the home. There is too little known to quantify precisely workplace risks due to passive smoking. However, the weight and consistency of the epidemiologic evidence, backed up by the data from active smoking, favor a causal link between passive smoking and serious disease, especially lung cancer. In the light of this evidence, enough is known to justify action to reduce smoking at work.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Incretin-based medications for treating obesity produce substantial short- and long-term weight loss and improve obesity-related comorbidities. However, associating lifestyle modification with new medications to treat obesity is generally advisable for several reasons. Firstly, healthy eating patterns and physical activity may offer important additional benefits, enhancing the patient's health and well-being. In addition, regular specialist counselling in lifestyle modification can help patients maintain their motivation levels and develop specific skills for addressing obstacles during the lengthy process of weight loss and maintenance, potentially improving outcomes in the long term. Given the high efficacy of the new weight-loss drugs, it would be timely to streamline and simplify the current gold standard of obesity management based on lifestyle modification. For example, it now seems redundant to prescribe strict diets or meal replacements to reduce calorie intake, or to recommend patients practice 200 to 300 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise for enhanced weight loss. Moderate calorie restriction and, at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and two sessions of muscle-strengthening activities per week may be more achievable and appropriate goals for sustainable weight loss in most patients on pharmaceutical obesity treatment. As regards lifestyle modification counselling, future studies should assess its optimal intensity and duration in the \"new medications for obesity era\".

      "title": "Le choix de la cocaïne, une question de délai",
      "abstract": "L'addiction a la cocaine est un trouble comportemental qui touche plusieurs millions de personnes en Europe. L'etude des mecanismes neurobiologiques de ce trouble repose beau-coup sur l'utilisation de modeles animaux, generalement des rats ou des souris. Dans la situation experimentale standard, ces animaux ont acces a la cocaine sans autre choix possible. Dans ces conditions assez artificielles, il est difficile de savoir si leur consommation de cocaine est in-fluencee par un etat d'addiction ou plutot par l'absence d'autres recompenses disponibles. En fait, quand on offre a des rats une autre recompense pendant l'acces a la cocaine (e.g., de l'eau sucree pendant quelques secondes), la vaste majorite d'entre eux s'abstient pour l'option alter-native. Ce resultat semble difficile a reconcilier avec les predictions associees a l’hypothese dopaminergique de l’addiction. Selon cette hypothese, la liberation supranormale de dopamine (aussi bien en intensite qu’en duree) provoquee par la cocaine lui confere un pouvoir recom-pensant largement superieur a celui d'autres recompenses (y compris l'eau sucree), et devrait se traduire par un choix quasi-exclusif pour la drogue. Ce paradoxe apparent peut etre resolu si l’on prend aussi en compte les delais imposes par la pharmacocinetique de la cocaine. En effet, une fois administree, meme par une voie rapide comme la voie intraveineuse, il faut un certain temps a la cocaine pour atteindre le circuit dopaminergique de la recompense dans le cerveau, ce qui impose un certain delai a la survenue des effets recompensants de la drogue. Selon notre hypothese, si ce delai d'action etait suffisamment long, il pourrait reduire la valeur de la cocaine au moment du choix en-dessous de celle de la recompense alternative, moins recompensante mais plus immediate. Ce travail de these avait pour but general de tester cette hypothese. Nos resultats confirment que les effets de la cocaine ne surviennent qu’apres un delai de plusieurs dizaines de secondes. Par ailleurs, lorsque l’influence de ce long delai etait neutralisee au mo-ment du choix, les animaux inversaient leur preference en faveur de la cocaine, confirmant que la cocaine genere bien une quantite de recompense superieure a l’option alternative. Ce travail nous revele egalement d’importantes lacunes dans notre comprehension du delai-drogue et de son impact sur le choix. Afin d’y remedier, des etudes complementaires, aussi bien theoriques qu’experimentales, devront etre envisagees a l’avenir.",

Valamennyi bizonyítékalapú testsúlycsökkentő terápia alapja az életmódváltás, amely minimálisan az energiabevitel korlátozását és a fizikai aktivitás növelését igényli. A betegek azonban az esetek túlnyomó többségében vonakodnak az életmódváltástól, aggodalmakat fejezve ki ezzel kapcsolatban (például „Én a levegőtől is hízom!”, „Nem bírok sportolni!”, „Nem akarok éhezni!”). Gyakori az orvosok részéről e félelmek „kifogásként” történő értelmezése. Ez az interpretáció egyfelől indulatot szül a páciensek irányában, másfelől meggátolja a figyelmes meghallgatást és az empátia kifejezését, így az ellenállás hátterében álló tényezők nem kerülnek feltárásra, feloldásra. Ennek következtében a szakember vagy nem tudja bevonni a pácienst a terápiába, vagy ha mégis, akkor az együttműködés mértéke elmarad az elvárttól, rontva a kezelés hatékonyságát. A páciens kioktatása vagy akár elmarasztalása pedig rontja az orvos-beteg kapcsolatot, és az egészségügyi ellátórendszer kerüléséhez vezethet, ami súlyosbíthatja úgy a súlyfelesleg mértékét, mint a kísérő betegségek lefolyását. A jelen tanulmány célja annak bemutatása, hogy hogyan érdemes reagálni a páciensek vonakodást kifejező mondataira, és milyen kommunikációs eszközökkel facilitálhatjuk a súlycsökkentő kezelésbe való sikeres bevonódást és az életmódváltás iránti elköteleződés erősödését, eszközöket adva az egészségkárosító szokások fokozatos leépítéséhez és a hosszú távon is fenntartható, hatékony, egészséges testtömegkontrollt szolgáló egészségvédő szokások kialakításához.

Recent Findings Cannabis, particularly the cannabinoid Δ9-tegrahydrocannabinol (THC), is associated with increased appetite, food cravings, overconsumption, and decreased physical activity. Cannabidiol (CBD) appears to be associated with decreased appetite. While cannabis use is not correlated with binge eating, cannabis use disorder is associated with loss of control eating. Despite cannabis’ association with unhealthy eating and sedentary behavior, most studies suggest that cannabis use is not associated with weight gain, or may even facilitate weight loss. Summary The state of the literature regarding the relationship between cannabis, weight, and weight-related behaviors is complex. Most studies do not differentiate between cannabinoid profiles, routes of administration, or whether cannabis use is problematic. Patients presenting for weight management should be cautioned about cannabis, particularly THC, potentially increasing risk of unhealthy eating and activity patterns.",

This knowledge could inform efforts to prevent youth access.Original cross-sectional survey with social media recruitment.Online.A total of 1729 adolescents (2809 qualified on screener; completion rate 61.6%) aged 15 to 17 years who vaped in the past 30 days.Adolescents' vaping attitudes, ownership of vaping devices, how they obtain devices, and frequency of borrowing others' devices.Logistic regression.Most adolescents (78.2%) owned a vaping device. The most common sources were purchasing from a store or online (31.1%), buying from another person (16.3%), or giving someone money to purchase for them (15.0%). The majority (72.8%) had used someone else's vaping device in the past 30 days. Adolescents who vaped more often, did not own a vaping device, vaped in social situations, and had previously been refused purchase were more likely to frequently borrow others' devices.Despite high rates of ownership, many adolescents borrowed devices, suggesting that borrowing is part of users' social experience, not just a means of acquisition. Although better enforcement of age restrictions could lessen purchasing, future research is needed to understand why adolescents borrow and how their acquisition sources shift over time. That information could be harnessed for targeted, borrowing-related antivaping campaigns.",

      "abstract": "We don't know why, but the use of nicotine is associated with the use of other substances, whether you look retrospectively in a clinical trial situation or prospectively in carefully defined groups.The association is always there and always very clear.My data show that among methadonemaintained patients who were trying to quit smoking, they were more likely to use illicit drugs on any day they smoked. Anne Joseph:There is no doubt that quitting smoking has health benefits with respect to lung disease and many other conditions.Whether it has good, bad, or no effects on chemical dependency outcomes is still up in the air, unfortunately.For a long time there were worries, not founded on any data, that there would be adverse effects.There have been about a dozen studies that did not seem to demonstrate such effects, and a few suggested smoking cessation might even have a beneficial effect on treatment outcomes.Lirio Covey: Most of the evidence has been on recovered groups, and it shows that if people quit smoking after being abstinent from alcohol for a while, quitting smoking does not jeopardize that abstinence.Dr. Sharp and colleagues, however, are talking about people in early recovery.We know very little about how smoking cessation will affect that group.I have some concerns.I see a parallel to the state of our knowledge with regard to smoking and psychiatric conditions such as major depression.We know a lot about people with past major depression.But we don't know what will happen if people stop smoking when they are still depressed or just recently got over their depression. Joseph:We just completed a randomized trial of treatment for nicotine dependence given concurrently with alcohol treatment, comparing it to nicotine treatment delayed by 6 months.The smoking cessation outcomes were identical in the two groups, in the neighborhood of 15 or 16 percent at 12 months.However, there is sometimes a trend and sometimes a statistically significant difference in alcohol treatment outcomes that favors delayed treatment.This is not the result we were expecting.Covey: Anne, can you speculate on the explanation for your finding?Joseph: One possibility has to do with pharmacological interactions between nicotine craving and alcohol craving.For example, abstinence from cigarettes may cause nicotine craving, and that might trigger intense craving for alcohol.Depression is another possible explanation for these findings.Many alcohol-dependent patients are depressed.If their depression is exacerbated by nicotine abstinence or relative nicotine deprivation, perhaps patients will use alcohol to self-treat their depression.Shoptaw: When you work with people who have multiple substances of dependence, removing one doesn't necessarily affect the others.Or it may.We don't know.Joseph: Our study results have yet to be duplicated.In addition, in contrast to the ATC scenario described in this article, the nicotine treatment in our study was not compulsory.All in all, the question of how con-",

      "title": "Death Due to Caffeine and Methamphetamine Toxicity: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is an over-the-counter psychostimulant that, when used in appropriate amounts, is generally considered safe. However, excessive use can cause various symptoms and, in severe cases, can even be life-threatening. A 34-year-old man with a reported history of psychiatric disorders was found unresponsive at his girlfriend's house and transported to an emergency department. He was presumed to have taken several caffeine pills and was pronounced dead approximately six hours later. There was no evidence of trauma or natural diseases at autopsy. Toxicology testing on hospital blood samples revealed toxic levels of caffeine and methamphetamine. After investigation of the circumstances surrounding the death and accounting for the autopsy and toxicology findings, the cause and manner of death were certified as combined caffeine and methamphetamine toxicity and accident, respectively. Lethal levels of caffeine have been reported when blood concentration exceeds 80 mg/L. Caution is needed to avoid excessive caffeine intake, especially when consumed in concentrated forms like tablets or powders. Caffeine should be used with care not only in cases of cardiovascular disease or genetic vulnerability but also for those with psychiatric disorders. Although deaths from caffeine are rare, they are consistently reported, necessitating attention and caution in its use.",

      "abstract": "Evidence for the importance of social rather than pharmacological factors in determining which intoxicants can be used, how they are used, and the consequences of use come from several sources. Alcohol use is probably the best example of the power of informal social controls to mediate a drug's pharmacological potential for harm. Alcohol is clearly a very dangerous drug. Physical addiction to alcohol can develop within a few weeks, and alcohol use is associated with dozens of physical and psychological problems, and with motor vehicle crashes, falls, accidental injuries. Assimilation of informal social controls begins in the family as children see their parents and adults drink. In some families, the socialization process includes allowing children to consume small quantities of alcohol. Formal social controls, the laws and regulations governing alcohol use, tend to buttress the norms and rituals that support controlled use. Informal social controls that encourage control, discourage abuse also operate within the subculture of illicit drug users.",

      "abstract": "In every culture, man has used drugs to dispel anxiety, stimulate productivity, and to increase the feelings of joy and satisfaction. Drugs have also had an undeniable influence on art and culture. These substances become referred to as ‘drugs of abuse’ if their repeated consumption is triggered or induced by psychological or physical compulsion, often leading to conflict with society, either due to neglect of family or social duties, and also to criminal activities in order to obtain the materials. Drug abuse particularly affects young people and has become one of the most important and widely discussed issues in society. It is therefore an important task in medical science to find answers to how drugs exert their effect and what leads to addiction and permanent consumption.",

Male social drinkers either exerted self-control by suppressing their thoughts or did not exert self-control while doing arithmetic. They then sampled beer.

Individuals who suppressed their thoughts consumed more and achieved a higher blood alcohol content than those who did arithmetic. The groups did not differ in mood, arousal, or frustration. Individuals higher in trait temptation to drink consumed more after suppressing their thoughts relative to those lower in trait temptation.

      "title": "Playing with Propranolol",
      "abstract": "When an anxiety-reducing drug with virtually no side effects is used to enhance performance, is that cheating? Is it drug abuse? Is it an admission of professional weakness? During a series of three performances, a trumpet player in a professional orchestra consistently plays a difficult solo passage flawlessly each time. Her colleague in trumpet section marvels at her ability to play so well, since he knows that he and other professional players are unlikely ever to play that particular passage with consistent perfection. His assessment of his colleague's luck and talent changes, however, when he learns she takes ten milligrams of drug propranolol before each performance that requires her to play difficult solo passages. Although many people will agree on what constitutes ethical and unethical use of certain types of drugs, some kinds of drug use do not fit easily into either category. The patient who demands an antibiotic for a viral head cold, athlete who requests steroids to enhance his or her performance, or child who receives growth hormone injections because of a perceived social advantage to being tall present instances of drug use that are difficult to evaluate from a moral perspective. Propranolol for performance anxiety represents another instance of ethical ambiguity in regard to drug use. The reason for such ambiguity is that ethical evaluation of drug use is shaped by cultural beliefs and values, many of which lie hidden in commonsensical, unquestioned assumptions we make about our world. These implicit meanings, when they surface, often are in form of vague images and incompletely articulated ideas. Furthermore, cultural images may have competing and contradictory meanings that add to ambiguity of a moral evaluation of drugs and their use. Propranolol use by musicians is an interesting case study for several reasons. It is a drug that can enhance one's performance and may increase one's advantage in competitive field of performing arts. As such, its use gives rise to moral questions similar to those raised by use of steroids by athletes, such as fairness, or harm to individual.[1] In addition, ambiguity about meaning of performance anxiety and propranolol use complicates moral issues. Is performance anxiety a normal phenomenon, as most musicians believe? At what point does it become pathological? Does fact that physicians prescribe propranolol to treat performance anxiety confer upon it status of disease? Or does fact that musicians often obtain this prescription drug from their friends and take it before any important performance constitute simply another form of drug abuse? Propranolol and Performance Anxiety Performance anxiety, or stage fright, has been defined as the experience of persisting, distressful apprehension about and/or actual impairment of, performance skills in a public context, to a degree unwarranted given individual's musical aptitude, training, and level of preparation.[2] Propranolol is a prescription drug increasingly used by symphony and opera musicians to eliminate symptoms of performance anxiety. The drug was first introduced for treatment of angina pectoris, and later used to treat cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension and to prevent sudden death after myocardial infarction. Propranolol use was later extended to treat migraine headaches and symptoms of anxiety associated with stress.[3] When a person is under stress, sympathetic nervous system produces adrenaline-like chemicals that attach to beta-adrenergic receptor sites of body. These sites produce physiological responses in heart rate, skeletal muscles, blood vessels, and bronchioles of lungs and, in essence, prepare body for a fight or flight reaction. Propranolol and other beta-blocking drugs compete with adrenaline-like chemicals for these sites on cells and block their physiological effects. …",

      "title": "Are Adolescent Smokers Addicted to Nicotine? The Suitability of the Nicotine Dependence Construct as Applied to Adolescents",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Adolescent cigarette smoking has long been regarded as a major public health problem. Particularly disconcerting is the observation that over the last several years, greater numbers of adolescents are taking up this destructive behavior. While some have assumed that the majority of these smokers are, or will become, nicotine dependent, the fact is that we know very little about the phenomenon of nicotine dependence in adolescence. In this paper, the author reviews the theoretical and empirical bases from which inferences regarding addictive smoking in adolescence can be drawn. It appears that although a significant proportion of teenage smokers do progress to dependence, this is not an inevitable outcome for all adolescent smokers. Moreover, the scientific study of nicotine dependence among adolescents is still in its infancy and, as such, more work in the area of measurement and assessment needs to be done. Implications for prevention and intervention efforts are also discussed.",

      "title": "The science behind vaping",
      "abstract": "This special issue examines the science behind electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), also called electronic cigarettes, e-cigarettes, vapour products or vapes. These products have emerged in the last 10–15 years as a potentially less risky alternative to cigarette smoking for those smokers who are struggling to quit smoking. Even though the serious health risks of smoking cigarettes are well understood, smoking remains common around the world. It is well accepted that the health risks from smoking are caused by inhaling toxicants created when tobacco is burned, and, although nicotine is addictive, it does not cause disease. The best way to avoid the health risks of smoking is to never start or to quit. Tobacco harm reduction (THR) is a pragmatic public health approach that aims to reduce the negative health impacts of tobacco use, by moving smokers from the most dangerous way to consume nicotine (combustible cigarettes) to alternative, less harmful (non-combustible) nicotine delivery products with vastly lower levels of toxicants. These alternative products include e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products such as snus or nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products, or nicotine replacement therapy products (NRTs) such as nicotine gums and patches (although these do not work for all smokers). The underlying philosophy of THR is that while complete cessation is ideal, harm reduction measures can significantly improve health outcomes for those who would otherwise continue to smoke. The concept of harm reduction, however, is controversial and polarised. Those who support it emphasise saved lives and reduced costs on society, while opponents emphasise concerns about ethical principles and potential unintended consequences. In the context of tobacco, some health advocates believe abstinence from nicotine is the only option. Increasingly, the controversy around e-cigarettes is about getting the balance right—these products are clearly reduced risk with respect to cigarettes in terms of chemistry and toxicology and can help some adult smokers to switch from smoking cigarettes, but there are potential risks about attracting nicotine non-users, in particular young people. Drug Testing and Analysis has long been interested in covering controversial topics, to help stimulate robust debate amongst stakeholders, hence the journal's interest in covering this topic. In our search for articles, we have broadened the scope to include studies that do not focus only on nicotine, but also studies that address detection of other substances such as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). We have taken a holistic approach to ‘drug testing and analysis’ to include drug delivery and pharmacokinetics of novel products, biomarkers associated with vaping, in vitro and in vivo studies, and the human experience relating to perceptions, behaviour and intentions, which are important when considering population-level effect of these products. In a section dedicated to the regulatory process, we have welcomed several articles from industry to expose our readership to the requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (CTP). We begin by exploring subjects that are perhaps familiar to our general readership, with the analysis of compounds in electronic cigarettes by Frinculescu et al.1 It is unsurprising that the vast majority (87/112; 78%) of the specimens tested contained nicotine, with a smaller proportion containing synthetic cannabinoids (22/112; 20%) and THC (11/112; 10%). Holt et al.2 deliver a case report on products containing cannabinoids with a collation of 11 case reports where alarmingly 8/11 individuals reported ‘hallucinogenic or dissociative-like effects’ while 10/11 cases reported use of ‘THC-free’ or off-label presence of Δ-9-THC in concentrations ranging from 0.02 to nearly 500 mg/mL. Haworth-Duff et al.3, 4 report on two preliminary analyses of e-cigarette aerosols, one focusing on the analysis and characterisation of a strawberry flavour aerosol using headspace-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,3 and the other on the analysis of trace metals using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),4 which show promise for future quantitative characterisation of constituents in vape aerosols. Reveil et al.5 report on the potential of enhanced drug delivery when drugs are combined in e-liquids to form a eutectic mixture. When methadone was combined with nicotine, increased recoveries of both nicotine (from 70% to 97%) and methadone (from 84% to 97%) were obtained. This is the first study to highlight the possibility of a toxicological impact of increased aerosolization resulting from polydrug consumption through e-cigarettes. In another study dealing with nicotine delivery, this time of an in vivo nature, Han et al.6 consider the importance of the form of nicotine (which is dependent on pH). In the tobacco leaf, nicotine exists in its salt form, and when it is extracted and purified to create pharmaceutical grade nicotine, it converts to its unprotonated or ‘freebase’ form. Han et al.6 examine the pharmacokinetics of freebase nicotine compared with three salts (nicotine lactate, nicotine tartrate and nicotine benzoate). Following subcutaneous administration in rats, the authors found that freebase nicotine can reach higher blood concentrations and nicotine concentrations were sensitive to the pH of the preparations. They suggest that this model can be used to screen for optimal pharmacokinetic properties of nicotine delivery systems. Scherer et al.7 describe some of their research to differentiate between users of different types of tobacco and nicotine products. They compared the urinary excretions of 19 different mercapturic acids (MAs; which serve as Biomarkers of Exposure to certain tobacco smoke toxicants) in six groups of volunteers who were exclusively using: combustible cigarettes; e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products; oral tobacco products (predominantly snus); or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; primarily nicotine gum); plus a group who did not use any tobacco or nicotine products. It is clear that smokers (users of combustible cigarettes) are distinct from all other groups on 13 of these MAs, but that distinction between non-cigarette user groups is not possible with just MAs. This adds to the body of work in this area. In a related Perspective article, Yach and Scherer8 describe recent progress in developing biomarkers that distinguish between exposure to tobacco smoke versus a range of nicotine products, including harm reduction products. They also highlight advances in measuring biomarkers that are predictive of future disease outcomes. This progress has implications for conducting more rigorous epidemiological studies and, from a more practical standpoint, for insurance companies approaches to underwriting. A series of papers look at in vitro testing of electronic cigarettes. In a minireview, Bishop et al.9 describe the advances of whole aerosol approaches underpinning in vitro testing and expose readers to the ever-changing landscape of e-cigarette devices and the necessity to adapt traditional exposure studies, providing five examples of optimisation of dosimetry and exposure. The toxicity profile associated with aerosols generated from e-cigarettes is addressed in several original research articles. Caruso et al.10 use in vitro assays to assess cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species, cell morphology and mitochondrial function in human bronchial cells in aerosols from four nicotine-containing e-liquids. Xu et al.11 examine four different products available in the Chinese market, first looking at chemistry by assessing the presence of 40 Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents in aerosols of e-cigarettes, and comparing with levels found in cigarette smoke. They then report on cytotoxicity and mutagenicity assays, demonstrating that aerosols from e-cigarettes are vastly less mutagenic and cytotoxic than cigarette smoke. Next, Caruso et al.12 describe a multi-centre approach involving four international laboratories in an effort to standardise and independently verify in vitro studies through the ‘Replica Project’. They demonstrate that aerosols from e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products displayed limited inhibition of endothelial cell migration and wound healing with respect to cigarette smoke in a ‘scratch wound’ assay. Together, these studies help to substantiate the reduced risk nature of e-cigarettes compared with traditional cigarettes. Lastly, Miller-Holt et al.13 report the findings of a workshop facilitated by the Institute for In Vitro Sciences (iivs.org), summarising progress in the harmonisation of protocols and provide recommendations for dosimetry, key challenges and areas for future research as an outcome of a working group. Standardising testing methodologies is very important from a regulatory perspective – it is critical for all stakeholders to be using the same methods for testing products. Guo and Hecht14 take us to a different aspect of e-cigarette research, with a systematic minireview of the literature that assesses potential DNA damage to oral cells after exposure to e-cigarette vapour (both in vitro and in vivo studies) and evaluates the possible connections between e-cigarette exposure and oral cancer. They conclude that although e-cigarettes may be implicated in DNA damage in human oral cells, in comparison with non-users, the adverse effects on DNA were found to be much less severe compared with what is seen with cigarette smoke. They caution that more thoroughly designed prospective cohort studies with larger sample sizes and longer periods of observation are necessary to establish the safety of e-cigarettes. While preparing this issue, it has been necessary to discuss e-cigarettes in the context of the regulatory pathways for the products in question. In the United States, successful authorisation of a Pre-Market Tobacco Application (PMTA) allows a company to sell a tobacco or nicotine product whereas a successful outcome of Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) allows a company to declare a product as having a lower risk than a cigarette. These pathways are comprehensively described in a perspective from Solyst15 using the experiences of Swedish Match, the first company to be granted the FDA's first authorizations, as an illustration. Patwardhan16 shares his perspective on the importance of education in bridging the gap between nicotine policy and what healthcare professionals do in practice. Despite decades of research about the relative safety of ‘clean nicotine’, and alternative nicotine products such as NRT and e-cigarettes being endorsed by various healthcare bodies for THR, many healthcare practitioners still bundle tobacco, cigarettes, smoking, cancer and nicotine into one, which prevents them from supporting their patients to make informed choices on safer nicotine alternatives. Patwardhan suggests nicotine confidence based on nicotine literacy starts with reforming medical curricula and myth-busting in the lay media to include factual statements about nicotine and public health policy discussions on the principles of harm reduction. Fearon17 provides an overview about human abuse liability (dependence) studies in a review article, including their design and standardisation and highlights the necessity to find the abuse liability ‘sweet spot’ in helping to reduce harm in cigarette smokers, where products have sufficient nicotine to encourage smokers to switch away from cigarette smoking but without posing a risk of initiation or addiction risk among current non-users of nicotine. Wadkin et al.,18 in their review, highlight the importance of translating human puffing behaviour (topography) to e-cigarette puffing regimes for chemical analyses in order to predict more accurately human exposure to emissions and risk in studies exploring harm reduction potential. Regulatory authorities (such as the US FDA and the European Union) must also manage risks at the population level, so it is critically important that reduced-risk products such as e-cigarettes only appeal to adults who are current smokers and nicotine users. In the United States, results from studies falling under the category of ‘Perception, Behaviour and Intention to Use’ are part of the supporting evidence for PMTAs, as they model the public health effects of e-cigarettes, by weighing the product's effects on intended users (benefits) versus unintended users (harms) across the whole population. Russell et al.19 report on one such study involving a disposable e-cigarette in the United States, in which current smokers rate their intentions to use this product to replace smoking partially or completely. Positive intent to use this product was highest among current smokers, much lower among former smokers and non-smokers, and lowest among never smokers. This suggests that the product being studied does not appeal to never smokers. Fearon et al.20 analyse data from two independent surveys about prevalence and perceptions about a pod-based e-cigarette in the United States. They show that curiosity and intention to use this product was 1.6–2.8 times more likely in current smokers than never smokers. Across both surveys, less than 0.1% of participants used this product prior to smoking and going on to become established smokers. So, although a proportion of smokers are likely to try this e-cigarette to substitute or reduce cigarette consumption, non-smokers are unlikely to use this product as a ‘gateway’ into smoking. In addition, Fearon et al.21 show that for the same product, higher concentrations of nicotine (which are associated with greater nicotine delivery) are not associated with higher levels of dependence, based on self-reporting amongst 1383 participants. Schiffman and Hannon22 examine a different aspect of consumer behaviour. While it is clear that some smokers use e-cigarettes to switch away from smoking, how this varies with previous quit attempts is unknown. Study participants were established adult smokers who had purchased a particular pod-based e-cigarette starter kit. They were surveyed initially about their prior quit attempts, and then assessed the overall switch rate after 12 months. Two thirds of participants had previously tried to quit, and the overall switch rate to the e-cigarette after 12 months was nearly 60%, suggesting that e-cigarettes may provide an alternate way for smokers with a history of failed quit attempts to stop smoking. Finally, Kumar et al.23 provide insights into how vaping is framed on online platforms and highlight the need for evidence-based content and better communication to the public to aid with smoking cessation and reducing youth vaping. We are pleased to have assembled a diverse collection of articles that delve into various aspects of e-cigarette research—the breadth of topics covered underscores the complexity of this emerging field. As vaping and e-cigarettes continue to be controversial, we hope that this collection will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, regulators and other stakeholders. It is our intention that insights shared will contribute to the ongoing and robust dialogue on this topic. In closing, we would like to thank all our contributors for their time and expertise in putting together this special issue. We would also like to say a special thank you to our referees, whose expertise and valuable insights have helped to ensure the rigour and quality of articles in the collection.

      "abstract": "There is no reason to assume that in old age defecation is different from younger people. Old people who are sound and active often have normal defecation. Their intestinal transit time has been shown to be normal. Nevertheless about fifty percent of the elderly use laxatives. In the very old and in institutions the use is even more frequent. The main cause of this real or supposed constipation is the lack of dietary fibre in the food. In the aged constipation can have dangerous complications, e.g. acute mental confusion, urinary retention, urinary incontinence and fecal impaction. Treatment may include general measurements, the addition of bulk-laxatives to the diet and the prescription of other laxatives. The use of laxatives other than bulk-laxatives may cause many harmful side-effects in the aged. The daily food must contain sufficient dietary fibre. Failing this one can use bran, preparations of psyllium or lactulose syrup.",

Terutama seseorang yang sudah kecanduan karena mengonsumsinya secara berkala. Sedangkan banyak remaja di era sekarang dengan pergaulan yang begitu mengerikan atau remaja yang masuk pergaulan yang salah menjadikan minuman keras sebagai trend yang malah menjadi suatu hal yang mereka banggakan, tanpa takut dampak dari minuman keras yang mengandung alkohol bisa menjadi masalah yang sangat mengkhawatirkan khusunya remaja yang sedang dalam fase dimana mereka merasa hal yang mereka lakukan semuanya benar. Karena kebanyakan di masyarakat minuman keras disalahgunakan apalagi mengonsumsinya dengan dosis atau takaran yang di luar batas yang bisa mengakibatkan seseorang mabuk dan kehilangan akal sehatnya.",

Um dos  motivos que levam os adultos a se tornarem dependentes de alcool pode ser o acumulo de estresse. Tambem pode ocorrer que os dependentes acabem encontrando a solucao dos problemas no alcool, nao percebendo que estao entrando em uma condicao da qual sera dificil sair. Com o objetivo de conhecer mais sobre esta dependencia, propoem-se um estudo bibligrafico como proposta de pesquisa apresentada ao componente curricular de Metodologia Cientifica.

For instance, if I don't maintain a healthy diet, take a break from exercise, face a difficult emotional situation, or lack good sleep, my work satisfaction and productivity take a nosedive. During the height of the coronavirus pandemic, I found myself exercising less, eating poorly, and having disruptive sleep patterns. This lifestyle took a toll on me and led me into such a state of frustration and lack of motivation that my doctor suggested I see a psychotherapist for potential depression. At that time, I was about to relocate, so therapy was put on hold. However, after moving to another country, I realized I needed a change. I delved into health-related literature, tried various approaches, and tweaked my routines in numerous ways. When I started properly caring for my sleep, physical activity, nutrition, and mental health, the benefits were soon apparent. I regained my motivation and energy, and within six months, I was feeling even better than before the pandemic. This experience taught me the fundamental importance of health and well-being, and I have maintained these practices ever since.",

Daher sind Begriffe wie Schulung oder bei einer Massnahme fuer Drogenauffaellige eher problematisch. Nicht Lerninhalte werden gefragt sein, sondern Einsichten, persoenliche Orientierungen und eine kontrollierte Verhaltenssteuerung. Aus rechtlicher Sicht kommen folgende moegliche Zielgruppen in Betracht: Personen, bei denen die Fahrerlaubnis (FE) wegen Einnahme von Betaeubungsmitteln (BtM) entzogen war; Personen, bei denen die FE wegen missbraeuchlicher Einnahme von psychoaktiv wirkenden Arzneimitteln oder wegen anderen psychoaktiv wirkenden Stoffen entzogen war; Personen, bei denen sonst zu klaeren war, ob sie noch BtM einnehmen sowie gelegentliche Cannabiskonsumenten, bei denen weitere Tatsachen Zweifel an der Eignung begruendet hatten. Die geeignetste Zielgruppe fuer einen Kurs zur Wiederherstellung der Eignung sind die (ehemals) gelegentlichen Konsumenten von Cannabis mit Trennungsproblematik, regelmaessige Cannabiskonsumenten oder unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen Konsumenten anderer Partydrogen wie XTC, Speed oder Kokain. Eine Wiederherstellung der Eignung im Bereich der BtM-Konsumenten ist stets mit dem Ziel einer stabilen Drogenabstinenz zu verbinden, andere Kursziele waeren nicht konform unter anderem mit den Begutachtungs-Leitlinien. Zwei Kursmodelle werden zur Zeit in Deutschland erprobt: und Gefahren im Strassenverkehr (DRUGS) und SPEED. Die Ziele, Methoden und Inhalte von DRUGS werden im einzelnen beschrieben.

      "title": "Dying to Quit: Why We Smoke and How We Stop",
      "abstract": "Historians and scientists a few millennia from now are likely to see tobacco as one of the major bafflements of our time, suggests Janet Brigham. Why do we smoke so much, even when we know that tobacco kills more than a million of us a year? Two decades ago, smoking was on the decline in the United States. Now the decline has flattened, and smoking appears to be increasing, most ominously among young people. Cigar smoking is on the rise. Data from a generation of young smokers indicate that many of them want to quit but have no access to effective treatment. Dying to Quit features the real-life smoking day of a young woman who plans to quit--again. Her comments take readers inside her love/hate relationship with tobacco. In everyday language, the book reveals the complex psychological and scientific issues behind the news headlines about tobacco regulations, lawsuits and settlements, and breaking scientific news. What is addiction? Is there such a thing as an addictive personality? What does nicotine do to the body? How does it affect the brain? Why do people stand in subzero temperatures outside office buildings to smoke cigarettes? What is the impact of carefully crafted advertisements and marketing strategies? Why do people who are depressed tend to smoke more? What is the biology behind these common links? These and many fundamental questions are explored drawing on the latest findings from the world's best addictions laboratories. Want to quit? Brigham takes us shopping in the marketplace of gizmos and gadgets designed to help people stop smoking, from wristwatch-like monitors to the lettuce cigarette. She presents the bad news and the not-so-bad news about smoking cessation, including the truth about withdrawal symptoms and weight gain. And she summarizes authoritative findings and recommendations about what actually works in quitting smoking. By training a behavioral scientist--by gift a writing talent--Brigham helps readers understand what people feel when they use tobacco or when they quit. At a time when tobacco smoke has filled nearly every corner of the earth and public confusion grows amid strident claims and counterclaims in the media, Dying to Quit clears the air with dispassion toward facts and compassion toward smokers. This book invites readers on a fascinating journey through the world of tobacco use and points the way toward help for smokers who want to quit. Janet Brigham, Ph.D., is a research psychologist with SRI International in Menlo Park, California, where she studies tobacco use. A former journalist and editor, she has conducted substance use research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the University of Pittsburgh",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking presents with considerable health risks and induces high costs on healthcare resources. People continue to smoke cigarettes in the face of adversity because they contain nicotine, which is highly addictive. Nicotine is a stimulant that exerts its effects within the brain by acting at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). nAChRs are located in areas of the brain involved in reward processing, motivation, and cognitive control, which results in disruptions to behaviour when nicotine addiction has developed. Disturbances to the brain and behaviour are particularly evident during early nicotine abstinence when people are in withdrawal. Importantly, treatments (e.g. varenicline, bupropion) that attenuate disturbances to reward and cognition in the brain during withdrawal in early nicotine abstinence are conferred with the efficacy to promote smoking cessation and protect against relapse.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: O consumo de substâncias psicoativas e uma caracteristica comum nas populacoes da maioria dos paises, inclusive as do Brasil, sendo o tabaco e o alcool as mais utilizadas. Muitas variaveis (ambientais, biologicas, psicologicas e sociais) atuam simultaneamente para influenciar a tendencia de qualquer pessoa vir a usar drogas e isto se deve a interacao entre o agente (a droga),o sujeito (o individuo e a sociedade) e o meio (os contextos socio-economico e cultural). O crack e uma das principais causas de busca de atendimento entre usuarios de drogas ilicitas, e uma droga com fortes propriedades estimulantes e que mais motiva o usuario a buscar tratamento, ainda que nao seja mais consumida, revela o impacto pessoal familiar dessa dependencia. Sua utilizacao produz uma euforia de grande magnitude e de curta duracao, seguida de intensa fissura e desejo de repetir a dose. O grupo iniciante consumidor da droga possui um perfil jovial. Em estudo realizado no municipio de Sao Paulo, detectou que aumentou o numero de usuarios a partir de 1989, com isso os servicos ambulatoriais comecaram a sentir o impacto do crescimento do consumo. Atualmente, o tratamento prioriza a desintoxicacao, a reducao de danos e o retorno ao convivio social. Objetivo: Conhecer as demandas da mulher usuaria de droga em tratamento de servico de saude mental. Metodo: Trata-se de um caso clinico, desenvolvido em um Centro de Atencao Psicossocial alcool e drogas, localizado no municipio de Fortaleza, Ceara, com uma mulher em uso abusivo de drogas psicoativas, com 28 anos, solteira, em situacao de rua por dois anos. Os dados foram coletados atraves da tecnica de entrevista durante uma consulta de enfermagem, seguindo-se um roteiro semiestruturado contendo perguntas fechadas e abertas. Resultados: no discurso da participante destacaram-se aspectos como a vulnerabilidade social da mulher usuaria de drogas, a vivencia de violencia psicologica e fisica, a prostituicao para a aquisicao de drogas, a exposicao em virtude da situacao de moradia de rua, prostituicao, as dificuldades no acesso ao tratamento da dependencia quimica, o preconceito relacionado ao fato de ser usuaria de psicoativos e a falta de abordagem das questoes de genero por parte dos profissionais do servico de saude. Conclusao: Foi perceptivel o fato de que as caracteristicas sociodemograficas da participante a tornaram vulneravel ao uso de drogas, as dificuldades em acessar e permanecer no tratamento em servico especializado. O abuso das mais variadas substâncias (alcool, tabaco, cocaina, maconha, crack e psicotropicos) trouxe varias demandas para o cuidado da participante, relacionados com prejuizos sociais (moradia de rua, desemprego), legais (detencoes), interpessoais (conflitos familiares) e de saude (doencas sexualmente transmissiveis, aborto e acidentes). Ressalta-se a importância no tratamento de casos de dependencia quimica e a adaptacao do mesmo as especificidades da mulher.",

Medication can cause constipation by slowing peristaltic contractions in the bowel. Environmental factors affecting constipation include the height of the toilet which affects the ability to have both feet on the floor to aid emptying of the rectum, lack of privacy, and seating comfort on the toilet. Using commodes at the bedside can cause people to hold on to faeces for fear of making a smell or sound. Some patients ignore the rectal sensation because of difficulty with mobility or because carers are not available at the right time. The longer the stool remains in the rectum the more water content is reabsorbed resulting in a harder stool.",

With this recent technological development and wide range of constituents in various products, putative adverse effects on the brain and body have been largely unexplored. Here, we review current evidence linking electronic nicotine cigarette use with potential health consequences and provide evidence supporting an association between drug use and depression in humans. We also examine the biological effects of individual constituents in electronic cigarette aerosols, which include labeled ingredients, such as propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine, and flavorants, as well as unlabeled ingredients found in the aerosols, such as carbonyls and heavy metals. Lastly, we examine the effects of electronic cigarette use on endogenous metabolism via changes in cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can thereby impact therapeutic outcomes. While the current evidence offers insight into the potential effects of electronic cigarette use on biological processes, further studies are necessary to determine the long-term clinical relevance of aerosol inhalation.",

      "abstract": "There is no doubt that the type, amount, composition, and timing of food intake can Dramatically affect exercise performance, recovery from exercise, body weight and Composition and health. When exercise or physical work increase to more than 1 hour per day, the importance of adequate energy and nutrient intakes becomes more critical. As the American public becomes more concerned with health and health issues, the interest in nutrition and physical activity has increased. This interest in health has also heightened the sale of supplements, herbal preparations, and weight loss products, all aimed at improving health, preventing or curing disease, improving sport performance, and changing body composition and weight. Sports nutrition’s the practical science of hydrating and fuelling before, during and after exercise. Executed properly, sports nutrition can help promote optimal training and performance. Done incorrectly or ignored, it can derail training and hamper performance. Active individuals need more energy (calories) each day than their sedentary counterparts assuming individuals are the same age, body size and participate in similar non-physically active daily activities. Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance means that active individuals need to replace the water and electrolytes lost in sweat. Nearly 25% of Americans use dietary supplements daily and ~35-40% use themoccasionally. For individuals engaged in physical activity, the estimates are as high as 50-100% (Sobal & Marquart, 1994). We now know that what you eat and drink can significantly impact health andexercise performance. The active individual needs to make sure they consumeenough energy to maintain a healthy body weight for their activity level and sport, while reducing risks of chronic disease. Active individuals need more carbohydrate and protein than sedentary individuals, and should not restrict fat intake too severely. Keeping well-hydrated and replacing fluids lost during exercise is also a key part of feeling good and performing at one’s best. Active individuals dieting for weight loss may need to supplement, but in general supplements should be used with caution and after careful examination of the diet.",

Se han desarrollado modelos animales para el estudio de esta patologia; los mismos ofrecen ventajas en la investigacion sobre alcoholismo, aunque los resultados no pueden generalizarse sin tener en cuenta la multicausalidad de los comportamientos humanos. Se desarrollaron modelos de autoadministracion de alcohol (caja-hogar y condicionamiento operante) y de administracion forzada (condicionamiento de lugar y de sabor), para estudiar diversos estadios del consumo, la fuerza apetitiva del etanol, procedimientos para facilitar el inicio del consumo, comportamientos de compulsion y recaidas y efectos de distintos eventos externos y del estado del animal que facilitan o inhiben el consumo. Se describen los procedimientos mas frecuentes, ejemplos de investigaciones recientes y sus implicancias para terapias psicologicas de esta patologia.",

      "title": "Smoking Cessation: What to Tell Patients about Over-the-Counter Treatments",
      "abstract": "Mr. T, age 56, has major depressive disorder that is well controlled with fluoxetine, 40 mg/d. He has smoked [greater than or equal to] 1 packs of cigarettes per day for last 25 years. On a recent visit, he indicates that he has begun using a 21-mg nicotine patch as advised by his pharmacist and that things are going OK, although he has had some slip ups. He is on week 7 of his quitting regimen and now is stepping down patch dosage. Upon further questioning he says that he has been cutting 21-mg patches in half to save money. Mr. T also explains that occasionally he has given in to a strong urge to smoke because it was too much to handle. He states that he does not think this is a big deal because he uses electronic cigarettes and has heard that these products don't contain the bad cancer stuff. At end of Mr. T's visit, he asks for something to help him sleep because has been unable to sleep consistently and has been having vivid dreams since starting patch. He also wants to know how to reduce itching from patch. Approximately 46 million Americans smoke and cigarette smoking accounts for 1 of every 5 deaths in United States each year. (1) Since advent of Stop Smoking campaigns, bans on smoking in public buildings, over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement products, and Surgeon General recommendations, discussing smoking cessation with patients has become standard practice. Research suggests that treatment to quit smoking should include a combination of pharmacotherapy and counseling, such as cognitive-behavioral strategies, support groups, and quitting hotlines. (2) Pharmacotherapy consists of OTC nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products and prescription medications. This article briefly highlights how to counsel patients about using OTC NRT products (Table, page 44). (2-5) Visit this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com for a table that highlights prescription smoking cessation agents. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Patches Nicotine replacement patches are best used for maintenance treatment of nicotine cravings. They deliver a fixed amount of nicotine over 24 hours. (3) Patches have a specially formulated transdermal matrix system and should not be cut. Doing so damages drug delivery system and could lead to drug evaporation from cut edges. (4) Mr. T's psychiatrist advises him not to cut patches but instead purchase 14-mg patch because he is at this step of smoking cessation regimen. Skin irritation caused by adhesive is a common adverse event from nicotine patches. Rotating location of each patch to a different hairless body area is best way to prevent or combat skin irritation. If rotating location of patch does not relieve irritation, patients can apply a thin layer of an OTC hydrocortisone 1% cream to affected site 2 to 4 times a day after gently washing area. (5) Instruct patients to avoid using occlusive dressings over topical application. Nicotine replacement patches also have been reported to cause vivid dreams and insomnia. (3) These side effects may be caused by nighttime nicotine absorption which might be avoided by switching to a different NRT product or removing 24-hour patch when going to bed. (4) Combining treatments Many patients experience nicotine cravings while using nicotine replacement patch. Stressful situations and events can trigger a patient's desire for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms that a patch that delivers a continuous amount of nicotine over 24 hours cannot alleviate. Combining different forms of treatment could combat these symptoms. (2), (3), (5) Combination therapy might consist of using sustained-release bupropion or a nicotine patch with rapid-acting NRT products such as a lozenge, gum, nasal spray, or inhaler. In Mr. T's case, clinicians recommend that he use nicotine polacrilex gum in addition to patch to quell his cravings. …",

A fatal overdose is the culmination of a series of events that can be difficult to understand. Overdoses are not new, as is illustrated by two case reports from the past of overdoses on laudanum, a mixture of alcohol and opium. One was fictional and one was attempted, but they show how even 200 to 300 years ago people overdosed on opioids (or what they thought were opioids) when they found themselves in unbearable situations.",

      "abstract": "We can understand resistance to treatment in smokers in two ways. First, when there is no awareness that smoking can be responsible for a physical disease, e.g., chronic obstructive lung disease or a dependence disorder. Second, when smokers actually seek treatment but fail to respond positively. The first kind-resistance related to lack of awareness-may not be so common in adult US smokers, but is more common among young smokers. Information is crucial to increase awareness. However, such information must be presented in such a way that smokers respond to it. Whether a smoker takes action will also depend on what options and choices are available. Encouraging abrupt cessation as the only option is unlikely to motivate the smokers who have tried to quit many times and failed and those who do not want to give up completely. Alternatives such as quitting gradually-even harm-minimization-should be considered. Hopefully, taking some control over smoking with the help of, for example, nicotine replacement can increase self-efficacy and motivation to quit. For those who find it impossible to quit, harm-minimization procedures should definitely be invoked.",

      "abstract": "The need has never been greater to support healthy eating and physical activity in children and youth; the numbers of overweight and obese children have doubled and tripled, respectively, over the past 3 decades. Poor eating habits, including inadequate intake of vegetables, fruit, and milk, and eating too many high-calorie snacks, play a role in childhood obesity. Grain products provide the highest percentage (31%) of daily calories, followed by \"other foods,\" which have limited nutritional value (22% of daily calories). Snacks account for 27% of total daily calories, which is more than the calories consumed at breakfast (18%) and lunch (24%), but not dinner (31%). For Canadians older than 4 years of age, more than 41% of daily snack calories come from other foods, such as chips, chocolate bars, soft drinks, fruit drinks, sugars, syrup, preserves, fats, and oils. Habits that protect against childhood obesity include eating more vegetables and fruit, eating meals with family, and being physically active. Children's food habits and choices are influenced by family, caregivers, friends, schools, marketing, and the media. Successful interventions for preventing childhood obesity combine family- and school-based programs, nutrition education, dietary change, physical activity, family participation, and counseling.",

Both experimental data and clinical reports suggest that medications play a major role in age-related chemosensory changes. Over 250 drugs have been reported clinically to affect the sense of taste. Taste impairments from medications include: ageusia (absence of taste), hypogeusia (diminished sensitivity of taste), and dysgeusia (distortion of normal taste). The sites of action for most pharmaceutical compounds that induce taste losses are not known, but medications can act at several levels including peripheral receptors, chemosensory neural pathways, and/or the brain. Extensive research has shown that drugs are secreted into the saliva, and salivary levels of many drugs are high enough to exert adverse effects on taste sensations either by modifying taste transduction mechanisms or by producing a taste of their own.",

Das oesterreichische Kraftfahrrecht traegt dieser Problematik insofern Rechnung, als sowohl die Verkehrszuverlaessigkeit als auch die gesundheitliche Eignung von Drogenkonsumenten direkt in Zweifel gezogen wird. Ebenso zweifelhaft ist aber auch, ob die noetige kraftfahrspezifische Leistungsfaehigkeit und die noetige Bereitschaft zur Verkehrsanpassung im ausreichenden Masse vorhanden sind. Die Leistungsfunktionen koennen bei laenger dauerndem Drogenkonsum auch im nicht akut beeintraechtigten Zustand deutlich herabgesetzt sein. Ebenso stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit eine ausreichende Bereitschaft vorhanden ist, einen vielleicht nur sehr sporadischen Drogenkonsum von der Teilnahme am Strassenverkehr strikt zu trennen. Beide Punkte lassen sich im Rahmen einer verkehrspsychologischen Untersuchung mit Hilfe standardisierter Leistungstests und Persoenlichkeitsverfahren sowie einer ausfuehrlichen Exploration klaeren. Im Falle einer eignungsausschliessenden Befundlage besteht darueber hinaus auch die Moeglichkeit, gemeinsam mit dem Untersuchten Strategien zur Wiederherstellung seiner Fahreignung zu erarbeiten, was aufgrund des oft hohen Stellenwerts des Fuehrerscheins einen deutlichen Motivationsfaktor fuer eine kuenftig positive Entwicklung darstellen kann.

      "abstract": "O consumo abusivo de alcool representa um grave problema de saude publica, sendo considerado um dos principais factores de mortalidade e morbilidade, afectando de forma significativa o funcionamento fisico e psiquico dos individuos. Sabe-se que mediante o tipo de consumo, a duracao e o inicio do mesmo, assim variam os danos no funcionamento cognitivo, o que tem consequencias no quotidiano de cada individuo. As consequencias do consumo no funcionamento cognitivo podem condicionar ate o processo terapeutico, nomeadamente a inibicao de comportamentos automaticos de consumo, a flexibilidade cognitiva para substituir comportamentos de consumo por outros mais ajustados, a capacidade para definir objectivos, que nao envolvam a recompensa imediata, entre outros. Por outro lado, coloca-se cada vez mais a hipotese da existencia de alguma vulnerabilidade, nos dependentes de alcool, destacando-se alguma fragilidade nos processos cognitivos, que podem conduzir ao desenvolvimento de comportamentos aditivos. Assim, deve existir a preocupacao de desenvolver programas reabilitativos, que integrem a intervencao nos aspectos emocionais, cognitivos e comportamentais, regendo-se pelo conceito da neuroplasticiadade. Desta forma, foi desenvolvido um projecto de Reabilitacao Cognitiva, na UTRA, que se destina a utentes com alteracoes moderadas a graves a nivel cognitivo, visando maximizar ou recuperar as funcoes cognitivas, de modo a atenuar o sofrimento e sentimento de inadequacao, promovendo o bem-estar e qualidade de vida, bem como prevencao de recaidas. Este programa tem a duracao de tres meses, integrando uma vertente multidimensional, que inclui a Consciencia do Defice; Gestao de Emocoes/Treino de Competencias Sociais /Comportamento; Treino Cognitivo. The abusive consumption of alcohol represents a serious problem of public health, considered as a main factor of mortality and morbidity; it meaningfully affects physical and psychological functioning of the individual. It is known that the extension of the damages on cognitive behavior depends on the type, length and beginning of the consumption and that has consequences in the daily activities each individual. The consequences of consumption on cognitive behavior are passive of affecting the terapeuthical process, namely the inhibition of automatic behaviors of inhibiting consumption, to cognitive flexibility to substitute consumption behaviors for other more adjusted or to the capacity to set other goals rather than automatic reward. On the other hand, each time more importance is given to the existence of some vulnerability on alcohol addicts, highlighting some fragility in cognitive processes, which can lead to the development of additive behaviors. Therefore, there must be a concern in the development of rehabilitation programs able to integrate emotional, cognitive and behavioral aspects based on the concept of neuroplasticity. This way, a Cognitive Rehabilitation project has been developed at UTRA intended for users with moderate to severe changes on cognitive level, aiming to maximize or recover cognitive functions, in order to attenuate suffering and feeling of not belonging, promoting well-being or quality of life to prevent relapse. This program will last three months and will integrate a multidimensional dimension including Deficit Awareness, Emotional Management/Training of Social/Behavioral Cognitive Skills.

Compounds in tobacco smoke cause adverse effects. Nearly all smokers have information about smoking hazards, but often this still does not cause them to quit smoking.

It is necessary to enhance anti-tobacco campaign, especially considering the fact that tobacco harms not only smokers but also nonsmokers due to secondhand smoke inhalation. In this paper we have presented information on health hazards of tobacco smoking based on the literature review of the last five years. There are stated diseases for development of which tobacco smoking is a serious risk factor.",

Many e-cigarette users also smoke conventional cigarettes (\"dual use\"). Some researchers argue that e-cigarette vaping, where tobacco burning seems to be eliminated, significantly reduces the number and con­tent of toxic substances when compared to combustible tobacco products. They also underline that consumption of less harmful tobacco and nicotine products can substantially reduce the health consequences of tobacco smoking when the cigarette smoking would be substituted by the e-cigarette use. However, the number of studies that prove negative health consequences of e-cigarette use is steadily increasing. Many carcinogenic, cardiovascular and pulmo­nary toxic compounds were found in e-cigarettes and, dependently on the patterns of e-cigarette use, their content may increase to the level observed for cigarette smoking. Studies prove that dual use of e-cigarettes and manufactured cigarettes is more risky than cigarette smoking. Therefore, there is an urgent need to regulate e-cigarettes as strictly as tobacco products.",

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes have become popular and are heavily promoted as a safer cigarette and an aid to quit smoking. Although they may have value in reducing cigarette use among smokers, they are of limited value in smoking cessation and pose many problems, particularly in children. Nicotine is highly addictive and affects virtually all cells in the body. It is particularly harmful to developing brains and other organs. The electronic nicotine delivery systems are largely uncontrolled and safety risks are manifold. Initiating nicotine use and increasing dependence in the population may be linked with increased tobacco and other addictive substance abuse even if the individual electronic cigarette delivers less harm than a combustible cigarette does.",

For this condition, however, the word introduced by Sollier<sup>2</sup>, namely, \"sitieirgy,\" meaning refusing food, seems to be more appropriate. For, in the insane, the patients do not want to eat, not because they are afraid of the food, but for different reasons; either they are in a state of depression, unwilling to do anything, even eating, or they have suicidal ideas, or they have illusions that the food may be poisoned,",

The history of tobacco use traces back to the dawn of human civilization and has been deeply entrenched into the human society since time immemorial. The social, economic, and health impact of tobacco has been a subject of intense debate over the recent decades. For India, this problem has been a unique one, with the consumption patterns either largely influenced by the socioeconomic backgrounds or dictated by the cultural diversity. With more than 200 million tobacco consumers in the country at present, it becomes imperative to address this health hazard and stir up strong measures toward damage control. This article addresses the tobacco problem, its evolution, and the factors that have affected the growth of Indian tobacco industry. It also highlights the current legislative measures against tobacco, fiscal gains to the government, and the serious health and economic impact to the consumer, compounded by the increasing cost of private health care in the present era of consumerism.",

Caffeine is the main active ingredient in energy drinks, and excessive consumption may acutely cause caffeine intoxication, resulting in tachycardia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death. The effects of chronic high-dose caffeine intake in children and adolescents are unknown. Caffeine may raise blood pressure, disrupt adolescent sleep patterns, exacerbate psychiatric disease, cause physiologic dependence, and increase the risk of subsequent addiction. Coingestion of caffeine and ethanol has been associated with increased risk-taking behaviors, harm to adolescent users, impaired driving, and increased use of other illicit substances. The toxicity of ingredients often present in energy drinks, such as taurine, niacin, and pyridoxine, is less well defined. Recent and significant literature describing adverse events associated with energy drink use are reviewed. Although prior studies have examined the effects of caffeine in adolescents, energy drinks should be considered a novel exposure. The high doses of caffeine, often in combination with ingredients with unknown safety profiles, mandates urgent research on the safety of energy drink use in children and adolescents. Regulation of pediatric energy drink use may be a necessary step once the health effects are further characterized.",

      "title": "New Alternative Tobacco Products – A Threat to Adolescent Health",
      "abstract": "Almost all cigarette use in the United States begins during adolescence, and about 3 of every 4 adolescent smokers continue to smoke into adulthood. Although overall cigarette consumption in the United States has decreased by 33% in the last decade, overall tobacco use among middle and high school students has demonstrated little to no decline. The United States has witnessed an increase in the use of new, so-called alternative tobacco products (ATPs). The many types of ATPs vary from the more popular smoked products such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and hookahs (also known as water-pipes or narghile) to smokeless products such as snus. These ATPs are believed by the public and adolescents to be less harmful, less addictive, and more stylish than cigarettes. They are being promoted as and perceived by adolescents, the general public, and health care clinicians as safer alternatives to traditional cigarettes.Many in the public health community fear that, in the absence of widespread awareness and regulatory policies, ATPs will encourage adolescents to start smoking and, thus, undermine a decades-long campaign to “denormalize” smoking. Rates of past 30-day use of e-cigarettes among middle and high school students tripled from 2013 to 2014, after doubling the year before. From 2010 to 2014, the percentage of high school seniors who used hookahs in the last year increased from 17% to 23%. In 2014, for the first time, e-cigarettes were reported to be the most commonly used tobacco product by high school students (13.4%), ahead of both hookahs (9.4%) and cigarettes (9.2%). Furthermore, the rise in ATP use is seen among all ethnicities.ATPs are marketed as low-risk alternatives to cigarettes, but there is evidence (albeit limited) of deleterious health effects equal to or worse than those associated with cigarettes. Hookah smoking has been associated with increased risk of lung cancer, periodontal disease, respiratory disease, and spread of infectious disease. Higher concentrations of toxic and irritating compounds have been found in e-cigarette vapor, including carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines, heavy metals such as cadmium and lead, and ultrafine particles, compared with cigarette smoke.Concerns have also been raised about secondhand exposure to ATPs. A multitude of studies has consistently found that secondhand exposure from ATP use contains dangerous levels of particulate matter, such as nicotine and carbon monoxide, that are often well above the Environmental Protection Agency’s standards for healthy indoor levels. Therefore, indoor use of ATPs may involuntarily expose nonusers to a variety of combustion products that, as a result of limited regulatory policies and research, may pose a greater risk than those found in cigarette smoke.In light of these dangerous products and their availability to adolescents and young adults, it is essential for pediatricians and other primary care clinicians to regularly implement preventive approaches, including screening, counseling, and advocacy efforts. Many adolescents and parents who use alternative tobacco products are not aware of their danger or mistakenly believe that the products are “safe” alternatives to cigarettes. Providing patients with accurate and judgment-free education is a crucial step in preventing initiation of use, reducing current use, and decreasing negative health impacts.Clinicians should recognize that screening for ATP use may not be as straightforward as screening for use of traditional cigarettes. It is important to list actual products (ie, e-cigarettes, hookahs) when asking patients about use because individuals may not associate such products with tobacco use. Some types of shisha (the combustible material smoked in hookahs) and e-cigarettes are flavored and marketed as nicotine-free, although air quality testing during use has been positive for the presence of nicotine. Flavored shisha and e-cigarette liquid can mask the taste of tobacco in the product, and hookah bars may advertise tobacco-free products to customers despite their actual use of nicotine, in violation of many clean air acts. Furthermore, with minimal to no regulations in place for shisha and e-cigarette liquids, the chemical composition of the products and quantity of tobacco and nicotine in these agents vary substantially. Another concern is the risk of accidental consumption by young children, who may be drawn to brightly colored and flavored e-cigarette liquids, resulting in severe toxicity and death upon consumption. Accordingly, screening practices asking about the use of a variety of individual products and advising patients about misleading ATP advertising are essential.Adolescent access to alternative tobacco products is not well-monitored in many settings. Hookahs are often used in social, bar, or lounge-like settings as well as in private homes. Although public venues may require legal identification, the legal age of consumption is 18, not 21 years. The social nature of hookah smoking, in which large groups of people publically share hookahs, makes it easier for underage youth to blend into the group. Consumption in homes also increases availability to underage youth because an adult or older teen can purchase a hookah and share it with family and friends. In the absence of federal regulations on the age of purchase and use of ATPs, regulatory responsibility has fallen to states and cities. However, some state regulations only prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors, a statute that rarely defines the tobacco products. The allure of ATPs, promoted by social trends, celebrity use, and flamboyant designs and flavors, makes them seem less harmful than they are.The evidence describing treatment options for hookah smoking cessation is limited, and findings about the efficacy of e-cigarettes for the cessation of cigarette smoking are inconclusive. Some individuals have been able to reduce or abstain from hookah smoking through individualized behavioral interventions such as motivational therapy or other cognitive interventions used in traditional cigarette cessation. Pharmaceutical interventions have proven less effective. The e-cigarette may well be a double-edged sword in relation to traditional cigarette use, either reducing or stopping cigarette smoking in current smokers but also promoting the start of cigarette smoking in nonsmokers. Considering the lack of evidence on the long-term safety of e-cigarettes and their uncertain efficacy in tobacco cessation, recommending their use for tobacco cessation to adolescents and young adults may not be appropriate. Some studies have suggested that e-cigarette use among adolescents may actually lead to cigarette uptake as well as nicotine addiction.Although many people believe ATPs are tobacco-free and safer than cigarettes, this is often not the case. ATPs are unregulated products and the tobacco industry uses traditional marketing tactics to target a vulnerable portion of the population. Pediatricians have an essential role as advocates for the regulation of ATPs to increase safety and, along with local health departments and nonprofit organizations, to provide adolescents and parents with accurate information about the questionable safety of these products. Pediatricians, general practitioners, and other clinicians have the responsibility to protect their patients from potential health risks by screening for, counseling, and offering education on ATP use.COMMENT: According to Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Tobacco use is still the leading underlying cause of death in the United States and worldwide” (Frieden TR. Shattuck lecture: the future of public health. N Engl J Med. 2015;373(18):1748–1754). In November 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics addressed this issue with 2 related policy statements and a technical report aimed at protecting children from the well-established harms of tobacco as well as a policy statement specifically addressing the dangers of electronic nicotine delivery systems (eg, e-cigarettes, e-hookahs, vaping devices). The Academy’s approach involves both a public health strategy that urges raising the minimum age for purchasing tobacco, nicotine delivery systems, and solutions to 21 years as well as direct clinical interventions by pediatricians. Such interventions include screening patients for the use of any tobacco product and of any nicotine delivery device and recognizing and addressing the effects of parents’ use of tobacco on their children’s health. As part of its public health effort, the Academy also urges that nicotine solutions be packaged in child-resistant containers and in concentrations that would not be lethal to young children, that flavoring of nicotine solutions be banned, and that advertising aimed at youth be banned.Unfortunately, we can anticipate that the Academy’s public health efforts will be resisted by the electronic nicotine delivery industry as vigorously as the tobacco industry fought against regulation of cigarette sales.

      "title": "A prática do mindfulness em grupo para dependentes de crack internados",
      "abstract": "O crack e uma droga derivada da cocaina, um estimulante do sistema nervoso central, que pode ser injetada ou aspirada, ou ainda convertida na sua forma alcalina, a pasta basica ou crack. Com alto potencial dependogeno, o crack produz complicacoes decorrentes do seu uso, que vao desde o calor e rubor, tremores incontrolaveis, desmaios e convulsoes, ate a overdose, problemas cardiovasculares, respiratorios, promiscuidade sexual, suicidios, homicidios e quadros psiquiatricos. O primeiro relato de consumo de crack no Brasil ocorreu na cidade de Sao Paulo, no ano de 1989. Nos ultimos 20 anos se pode observar um crescimento significativo do consumo de crack em todo o Brasil, e atualmente, os casos de dependencia ja sao responsaveis por 70% das internacoes por cocaina. Por ser uma droga relativamente nova, o conhecimento que se tem a respeito do seu tratamento ainda e escasso, o que tem feito com que as politicas publicas de prevencao e tratamento sejam ainda insuficientes. Entre os maiores desafios que os servicos de saude tem enfrentado no tratamento de dependentes de crack estao a fissura e os sintomas de ansiedade. O craving ou fissura e um desejo intenso de utilizar uma determinada substância, e esta entre os principais motivos que levam os dependentes de substâncias psicoativas como o crack a recairem e abandonarem a terapia. O transtorno ansioso, que tem como principais sintomas a inquietacao motora, sudorese, taquicardia, angustia, e mal estar generalizado, e outro problema relacionado ao uso abusivo de drogas. Isto porque os ansiosos tendem a buscar alivio para a ansiedade em drogas como a maconha, crack, opio e morfina. O que se tem preconizado como tratamento mais eficaz para os dependentes de crack e o uso concomitante de medicacao e terapia cognitiva ou comportamental. Dentre as tecnicas utilizadas pelas terapias cognitivas e comportamentais para o manejo da fissura e da ansiedade esta a pratica de mindfulness. O termo mindfulness refere-se a uma consciencia sincera, de momento a momento, nao julgadora. Com suas raizes em tradicoes como o budismo, yoga e taoismo, ela consiste na atencao, no momento presente, a todos os eventos internos ou externos, sem qualquer julgamento ou resistencia. Tendo como objetivos o aumento da aceitacao e a diminuicao da evitacao das experiencias internas, sua pratica pode ser resumida como a percepcao sem julgamentos de sensacoes corporais, pensamentos, emocoes, imagens, sons, cheiros e gostos. Ha praticas formais de mindfulness como a meditacao, o yoga, o chi kung e o tai chi chuang, e outras nao formais, que consistem na atencao plena em qualquer atividade cotidiana como comer, caminhar, lavar louca, ou outra. Apesar de estar ligado a diversas tradicoes religiosas, o mindfulness vem sendo praticado tambem fora do contexto religioso, tendo como principal beneficio desta dissociacao a democratizacao da sua pratica. Na decada de 1970, na Stress Reduction Clinic, se comecou a utilizar a pratica de mindfulness em programas de reducao do estresse. Apos os resultados positivos observados nestes programas, diversos terapeutas cognitivos e comportamentais vem tambem estudando e adotando este modelo de intervencao. A rapida absorcao desta tecnica por parte dos terapeutas cognitivos e comportamentais pode ser explicada pelo fato da nocao do mindfulness estar ja anteriormente e de forma implicita presente nas praticas clinicas tradicionais das terapias cognitivas e comportamentais. Na considerada terceira onda das terapias comportamentais ha diversas abordagens que adotaram a tecnica mindfulness, destacando-se a terapia de aceitacao e compromisso (ACT); a terapia comportamental dialetica (TCD); a terapia cognitivo-comportamental baseada na aceitacao (TCBA); e a terapia cognitivo-comportamental baseada em mindfulness e aceitacao. Atualmente se vem utilizando a pratica de mindfulness nao somente nos programas de reducao do estresse, mas tambem no tratamento de outras patologias como o Transtorno de Ansiedade Generalizada, Transtorno de Pânico, dores cronicas, depressao, e como prevencao da recaida com dependentes quimicos. O objetivo deste trabalho e apresentar a experiencia da realizacao de um grupo de mindfulness para dependentes de crack internados em uma unidade especializada para dependencia quimica. O grupo de mindfulness e realizado com frequencia semanal com duracao de 30 minutos e sao convidados a participar todos os pacientes dependentes de crack que estejam entre 5 e 15 dias em abstinencia, que nao apresentem sintomas psicoticos e que tenham condicoes fisicas e cognitivas para participar desta intervencao. Participam de 5 a 10 pacientes, do sexo masculino, entre 18 e 65 anos de idade, e o grupo e dividido da seguinte forma: 1- exercicios de alongamento; 2- explicacao da respiracao diafragmatica e da postura corporal para a pratica de mindfulness; 3- aplicacao da tecnica; 4- psicoeduacao do grupo a respeito da tecnica; 5- solicitacao de feedback aos pacientes. Na fase 1 sao adaptados 5 exercicios de alongamento do Lian Gong, um dos sistemas da ginastica terapeutica chinesa, com o objetivo de preparar o corpo dos participantes para a pratica de mindfulness. Na fase 2 e solicitado que os participantes sentem-se confortavelmente nas cadeiras, mantendo a coluna ereta, os ombros relaxados, o dorso das maos repousando sobre as pernas ou joelhos, o pescoco relaxado com o queixo ligeiramente para dentro, a lingua no palato, e os olhos fechados ou semiabertos. E, ainda, solicitado aos participantes que se mantenham em completo silencio e com o corpo imovel durante toda a pratica. Na fase 3 e aplicada a tecnica propriamente dita. Uma das meditacoes utilizadas e a atencao plena na respiracao, que e feita atraves da conducao verbal do terapeuta, mais ou menos da seguinte forma: torne-se consciente da sua respiracao, percebendo o ar entrar e sair enquanto voce respira; sinta a sua barriga subir quando o ar entra e descer quando sai; procure nao controlar a respiracao, apenas a observe passivamente; se pensamentos ou sentimentos surgirem em sua mente, nao tente suprimi-los nem os ignore, simplesmente observe-os; entao, volte para a percepcao da respiracao e do movimento da barriga, usando-as como âncoras; caso os mesmos pensamentos surjam de forma persistente, apenas os observe, sem julgar, e volte para a respiracao; perceba os pensamentos como nuvens passageiras, que vem e vao; procure nao lutar contra eles; sempre que sua mente, por qualquer motivo, se afastar da respiracao, traga-a suavemente de volta; para terminar a meditacao, mexa levemente os pes, as maos, se espreguice, abra os olhos, e permaneca por um minuto ou mais ainda em silencio. Ao termino, na fase 4, e explicado que esta tecnica pode auxiliar na impulsividade, no manejo da fissura e na diminuicao dos sintomas da ansiedade, funcionando como estrategia para a prevencao da recaida. Os pacientes tem relatado no feedback diminuicao significativa da fissura e dos sintomas de ansiedade durante a realizacao da tecnica. Alem disso, verbalizam que conseguem relaxar e percebem que a tecnica pode ser util apos a alta em situacoes de risco de recaida. Recomenda-se que a pratica de mindfulness seja utilizada como coadjuvante no tratamento dos dependentes de crack, e que mais pesquisas sejam feitas a este respeito.",

      "title": "El desafío de los cigarrillos electrónicos",
      "abstract": "El cigarrillo electrónico (e-cig) es un dispositivo con forma de cigarrillo convencional que libera determinadas dosis de vapores de nicotina a través de un proceso de calentamiento electrónico. Los cartuchos de nicotina tienen mucha variabilidad en la cantidad de nicotina liberada, incluso dentro de la misma marca. No todas las marcas admiten que contienen nicotina, pero esta se detecta en la mayoría de unidades analizadas. El e-cig contiene habitualmente propelentes como el propilenglicol, que es un producto irritante pulmonar. El efecto respiratorio a corto plazo del vapor de un e-cig es similar al causado por el humo del cigarrillo y es causa de broncoconstricción. La mayoría de marcas contienen glicerina, y se ha detectado al menos un caso de neumonía lipoidea por esta sustancia. Muchas marcas contienen trazas de N-nitrosaminas, metales pesados y otros productos que se encuentran en el humo de los cigarrillos convencionales en mucha mayor proporción. Actualmente no se dispone de evidencia científica de que sea un dispositivo eficaz para dejar de fumar, por lo que no debe recomendarse de forma proactiva para este fin y puede interferir en el uso de tratamientos de evidencia científica demostrada para dejar de fumar. Puede tener un efecto indeseable al promover el inicio del consumo en adolescentes o retener a fumadores adultos en el consumo de nicotina y en la dependencia gestual. No se conoce bien la toxicidad de los vapores pero se sabe que no son inocuos, por lo que no deberían utilizarse en espacios públicos cerrados. The electronic cigarette (e-cig) is a device with a conventional cigarette shape that releases a determined dose of nicotine vapour through an electronic heating process. The nicotine cartridges vary significantly in the amount of nicotine released, even within the same brand. Not all brands admit that they contain nicotine, but this is detected in the majority of units analysed. The e-cig usually contains a propellant, such as propylene glycol, which is a lung irritant. The short-term respiratory effect of the vapour of an e-cig is similar to that caused by the smoke of a cigarette, and is a cause of broncho-restriction. The majority of brands contain glycerine and at least one case of lipoid pneumonia has been detected due to this substance. Many brands contain traces of N-nitrosamines, heavy metals, and other products that are found in conventional cigarette smoke, but in a much higher proportion. There is currently no scientific evidence available that shows it is an effective device for quitting smoking, thus it should not be pro-actively recommended for this purpose, and may interfere with the use of demonstrated scientific evidence-based treatments for quitting smoking. It may have an undesirable effect on promoting the starting of smoking in adolescents or keeping adult smokers consuming nicotine and on gestural dependency. The toxicity of the vapour is not well known, but it is known that they are not innocuous, thus they should not be used in closed public spaces.",

A contínua exposição à nicotina e outras substâncias presentes no cigarro eletrônico, como por exemplo, metais pesados e compostos químicos tóxicos potencialmente cancerígenos, representa uma preocupação, visto que os efeitos a longo prazo do uso dos cigarros eletrônicos ainda não são totalmente compreendidos. Dessa forma, esse estudo, uma revisão de literatura, tem como objetivo analisar os possíveis efeitos do uso do cigarro eletrônico na saúde bucal e geral, relatando suas consequências para a prática odontológica e o papel do dentista na orientação e prevenção de riscos associados ao seu uso. Apesar de serem ofertados como menos nocivos, a utilização desses dispositivos apresenta riscos significativos à saúde sistêmica, podendo comprometer os sistemas respiratório e cardiovascular, além de estarem associados a lesões pulmonares graves, como a EVALI (Lesão Pulmonar Associada ao Uso de Cigarro Eletrônico ou Produto de Vaporização). Em relação à saúde oral, o uso prolongado desses dispositivos aumenta as chances de desenvolvimento de doença periodontal, cárie dental e outras condições, como xerostomia e estomatite nicotínica.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is an appearance of psychical or physical (metabolic) addiction of alcohol or some other medium. Beside from being addicted to some psychoactive substance, we can see more and more people in recent years whose addiction has developed from some activity or frequent behaviour, that is now shifting from obsession to obsessive and addictive behaviour. Among these types of addictions, is also the addiction to the games of chance (dices) that can be manifest itself precisely through betting. Today, very few people actually know what it is and what kind of addiction it is, often not looking at it as such and not realizing that it leads to considerably big problems and consequences, even greater than dependence on some psychoactive substance. Addictive betting is sometimes referred to as a concealed disease because the physical symptoms are not visible, but are projected to almost the entire psychological condition of the psychological condition of the addict himself. If we look at just a little around the world around us, we can see how more and more open sports betting today and notice how the dice literally offers itself and watches at each step to find someone to devour. Unfortunately, sports bookmakers have become increasingly frequent places where people of all ages and sex groups spend their free time, fooling themselves of just having a little fun and killing boredom. That originally lying to ourselves, becoming more and more reflected in other aspects of life in which the family is most affected. The awareness of how dangerous this addiction is, derives from the fact that an addict who is blind and trapped begins to commit violence against his spouse and children. The child, though is very small, notice that something is wrong with his family, when there is no joy and laughter in the house, but tears and tears have become a sad reality everyday. Often because of the suppression of the problem and the avoidance of being confronted with it, parents become locked in themselves, in this way they obviously ignoring their own child by denying his time, attention, and love. The child then begins to feel guilty and thinks the family breaks down just because of it. From feeling guilty, emotional (anger depression, anxiety, hopelessness), physical disturbances (asthma allergies, chronic headaches) and behavioural disorders are beginning develop in the child. Parents are the most powerful model of behaviour for their children, so a child who experienced trauma because of addiction by one or both parents can start modelling such behaviours, and they could also start to play games of chances. In order to solve the problem in time, we must take the first step, look to the truth in the eye, acknowledge the problem and seek help through treatment through various prevention programs and specially designed therapies.",

      "title": "Effect of exercise on protein requirements",
      "abstract": "The effect(s) of exercise on dietary protein requirements has (have) been a controversial topic for many years. Although most expert committees on nutrition have not provided an additional allowance of protein for active individuals, a considerable amount of experimental evidence has accumulated during the past 15 years which indicates that regular exercise does in fact increase protein needs. Part of the confusion is due to methodological difficulties and inadequate control of several interacting factors including: diet composition, total energy intake, exercise intensity, duration and training, ambient temperature, gender, and perhaps even age. Although definitive dietary recommendations for various athletic groups must await future study, the weight of current evidence suggests that strength or speed athletes should consume about 1.2-1.7 g protein/kg body weight.d-1 (approximately 100-212% of current recommendations) and endurance athletes about 1.2-1.4 g/kg.d-1 (approximately 100-175% of current recommendations). These quantities of protein can be obtained from a diet which consists of 12-15% energy from protein, unless total energy intake is insufficient. There is no evidence that protein intakes in this range will cause any adverse effects. Future studies with large sample sizes, adequate controls, and performance as well as physiological/biochemical measures are necessary to fine tune these recommendations.",

      "title": "A Bridge Too Far: Individuals With Regular and Increasing Very Heavy Alcohol Consumption Cannot be Considered as Maintaining “Recovery” Due to Toxicity and Intoxication-related Risks",
      "abstract": "The concept of “recovery” from alcohol use disorders (AUD) has garnered increasing scientific interest in recent years including attempts to explicate and measure its presumed component parts. In general, there is consensus that “recovery” should not be solely about abstinence or quantity-frequency measures of alcohol consumption and should include measures of functioning. Some researchers have taken an even more radical step, however, to suggest that psychosocial functioning should be the sine qua non defining feature of “recovery,” seemingly irrespective of how much one drinks; as such, people can be classified as achieving and maintaining successful “recovery” despite engaging in regular very heavy drinking. This commentary argues against this notion, as it goes beyond existing data and largely ignores the more insidious toxicity-related, as well as acute intoxication-related, health risks, known to occur with heavy alcohol exposure that contradict the salubrious intent of the “recovery” construct. Furthermore, classifying someone as being in successful “recovery” due to high functioning but while engaging in very heavy drinking, ignores the potential collateral damage to close significant others (eg, children, partners), whose well-being can be severely impacted by the enduring unpredictability of heavy use. Finally, it is argued that exclusive championing of “functioning,” while paying little if any attention to AUD remission or alcohol exposure status, creates a conceptual conundrum whereby someone with low functioning but who is in long-term AUD remission or completely abstinent could be classified as not achieving “recovery,” holding such individuals to a higher standard and may be stigmatizing.",

We demonstrated that habituation to a food item can occur even when its consumption is merely imagined. Five experiments showed that people who repeatedly imagined eating a food (such as cheese) many times subsequently consumed less of the imagined food than did people who repeatedly imagined eating that food fewer times, imagined eating a different food (such as candy), or did not imagine eating a food. They did so because they desired to eat it less, not because they considered it less palatable. These results suggest that mental representation alone can engender habituation to a stimulus.",

The exposure is usually more obvious and often substantial in occupational environments but frequently occurs in non-occupational settings, such as homes, schools, restaurants, grocery stores, and commercial flights. The exposure can be trivial, as in mere smelling or being in the vicinity of the food. The clinical manifestations can vary from a benign respiratory or cutaneous reaction to a systemic one that can be life-threatening. In addition to strict avoidance, such highly-sensitive subjects should carry self-injectable epinephrine and wear MedicAlert(R) identification. Asthma is a strong predisposing factor and should be well-controlled. It is of great significance that food inhalation can cause de novo sensitization.",

      "title": "Do Maladaptive Schemas Put Young People at Risk for Addiction?",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nThe use of psychoactive drugs is a wide spread phenomenon which occurs in virtually all cultures of the world. Most people who consume psychoactive substances may control their consumption well over their whole life span and even draw benefits from it (1). In a minority of the users, however, controlled drug use can make a transition to drug addiction. This is a psychiatric disorder which requires treatment, or even better, prevention. Although drug use is the ‘conditio sine qua none’ of developing drug addiction, there are additional factors that contribute significantly to the risk. There are genetic (2) and epigenetic factors (3, 4), and there are environmental factors. These environmental factors may be further distinguished in passively incurred and actively developed factors (5). Passively incurred factors may be the experience of a natural disaster or a major private loss, which may then trigger the escalation of drug consumption. But there are also actively developed environmental factors. One group of them is the schemas that people form. These are patterns of beliefs and thoughts about oneself, others, and the environment, which shape how we perceive our environment, how we form memories and how we generate behavior. These schemas are acquired starting in early life. They can be helpful or maladaptive. Young et al. (6) had identified eighteen maladaptive schemas which were grouped in five areas: 1) disconnection/rejection, 2) impaired autonomy/performance, 3) impaired limits, 4) other directedness and 5) over vigilance/inhibition. These schemas are believed to foster negative experiences in life and produce a rather insufficient coping with psychological pressure. Positive schemas, in contrast, allow people to experience more positive experiences and allow for a better coping with stressful life events. Previous studies have shown that an enhanced rate of early established maladaptive schemas is found in drug users (7, 8). While genetic, epigenetic and also passively incurred environmental factors can only explain a small proportion of the addiction risk, it is currently unclear which role actively developed factors might play.\r\n\r\nBakhshi Bojed and Nikmanesh asked in their study whether the establishment of maladaptive schemas increases addiction potential of young people and whether these early maladaptive schemas can predict addiction potential. To address this question they investigated 260 students (159 females, 101 males) of the University of Sistan and Baluchestan in the year 2011-12. They were all young adults 19-25 years of age. All subjects were administered the Addiction Potential Scale questionnaire to evaluate current addiction potential. In order to measure early maladaptive schemas, the young schema questionnaire – short form was used. The main finding of this study was a significant positive correlation between addiction potential and all of the five areas of early maladaptive schemas (disconnection/rejection, impaired autonomy and performance, Impaired limits, other-directedness and over vigilance/inhibition). In a regression analysis the authors identified the schema of disconnection/rejection as the most influential factor, which alone determined already 0.16 of the variance in the addiction potential. Together with the schemas ‘impaired autonomy’ and ‘other-directedness’ it explained 0.19 of the variance (9). These findings clearly suggest that there is a strong relationship between early maladaptive schemas and the addiction potential in young adults. Maladaptive schemas are established early in life often by family interactions. In fact, offspring copies the schemas of parents, family members or even peers. This may explain why there is a high inheritance of the addiction risk (10), but only a small part of it appears genetically or epigenetically transmitted. As the present study shows, an increasingly big role might be played by inherited schemas, where children simply copy maladaptive schemas of their parents. Maladaptive schemas not only predict addiction as it was shown in previous studies (7, 8), but already the addiction potential. Thus, they may well suit as screening instruments to identify people at increased risk of addiction and may allow focusing prevention programs in the future.",

Academics and policy makers seem to universally acknowledge that the social network in which agents are embedded, take decisions and consume, is one of the key elements, together with tastes and various demographics, in determining the smoking behavior of people. This article discusses how accounting for the external effects of smoking (second-hand smoke) and for the concern that people have for their friends and relatives who are exposed to such effects, can help interpret some of the recent trends in smoking behavior, and possibly suggest how to tune anti-smoking policies.",

      "abstract": "One in seven Nigerians aged 15 to 64 had used illicit substances (other than tobacco and alcohol) in the past year, with significant numbers suffering from drug-related disorders. Cannabis, known as marijuana or Indian hemp, contains THC, which affects brain receptors. Short-term effects include mood swings, memory loss, and poor coordination, while regular use can lead to anxiety, depression, and respiratory problems. Nigeria has strict laws against cannabis use, with severe penalties for possession and distribution. Tobacco is widely used for its nicotine content. Short-term effects include high blood pressure and increased heart rate, while long-term use can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Smoking is legal in Nigeria, but there are efforts to reduce tobacco usage through taxes and health campaigns. Khat, or miraa, contains cathinone, causing similar short-term effects as tobacco. Though illegal in Nigeria, it remains used in some Northern communities. Datura stramonium, or jimsonweed, contains harmful substances that can cause hallucinations. Its use is also illegal in Nigeria, its traditional medicine practices can be risky despite potential benefits. The purpose of this review is to develop a review of current research on toxic, narcotic, psychoactive plants and ecological risk assessment, as well as to point out deficiencies and to offer motivation for enhancing the research level in this field. Research on psychoactive plants is being conducted progressively, and significant progress has been made in the aspects of occurrence. Nevertheless, there are some areas for improvement and more research needs be carried on the selected plants as well as other plants in existence.",

Illicit substance use may contribute to adverse effects, interfere with treatment efficacy, or even augment treatment effects. Additionally, regular users of illicit substances may exhibit poor medication adherence or impaired ability to engage in behaviours such as blood glucose testing in diabetes.Systematic research on drug interactions with illicit drugs is not routinely conducted – most evidence comes from case reports. However, drug interactions are important. Many deaths that are attributed to illicit drug toxicity alone are often actually the result of drug interactions. This article reviews potential drug interactions with illicit drugs, with an emphasis on the two most popular illicit drugs in Australia – cannabis and methamphetamine.",

      "abstract": "The primary study aim was to examine whether rates of using e-cigarettes (\"vaping\") to lose weight are elevated among American adults who self-report having an eating disorder (ED).Adult vapers who reported either currently having an ED (n = 178; 72.5% women, 83.7% White, mean age 33.26 [SD = 8.35] years) or no ED history (n = 433; 54.7% women, 83.4% White, 35.98 [SD = 11.71] years) completed an anonymous survey.Relative to participants reporting no ED history, participants who reported currently having an ED were more likely to report vaping to lose/control weight, because it can be concealed from others, and due to the availability of sweet flavors. Participants reporting a current ED also were more likely to vape daily, to use higher nicotine concentrations, and to vape to relieve negative affect than were individuals without EDs.Individuals who self-reported currently having an ED endorsed vaping motives that are consistent with eating pathology (e.g., substance-induced weight loss, hiding compensatory behaviors from others). They also were more likely to vape daily and to use higher nicotine concentrations, raising health concerns. The findings suggest that treatment providers should screen for e-cigarette use in clients seeking ED treatment.",

Objetivos En las últimas décadas ha aumentado el número de estudios centrados en cómo los trastornos alimentarios pueden conducir al desarrollo de la adicción a las drogas y en la comorbilidad que existe entre ambos trastornos. Nuestro objetivo es subrayar las similitudes entre el trastorno por atracón y los trastornos por uso de sustancias.Incluye los puntos en común conductuales y neurobiológicos entre el trastorno por atracón y la adicción a las drogas, centrándose especialmente en estudios recientes con animales. 2. Material y métodos Se realizó una revisión literaria no sistemática en las bases de datos Pubmed y PsicINFO, buscando las siguientes palabras clave: “trastorno por atracón”; “adicción” y “trastorno por uso de sustancias”. 3. Resultados y conclusiones Los atracones pueden ser un factor de riesgo o una puerta de entrada a la adicción a las drogas y, por otro lado, la adicción a los psicoestimulantes puede conducir a varios trastornos alimentarios. Si la alimentación es un factor de riesgo que afecta los mismos mecanismos neurobiológicos que las drogas de abuso, la exposición temprana a ciertos tipos de alimentos ultraprocesados podría ser una puerta de entrada a una mayor sensibilidad a la recompensa. La alta comorbilidad que existe entre los dos trastornos apoya la hipótesis y destaca la importancia de identificar y tratar ambas condiciones.Sin embargo hasta el momento, los psiquiatras que trabajan en centros de abuso de sustancias no siguen protocolos que aborden los trastornos alimentarios entre sus pacientes. Asimismo, los psiquiatras que se ocupan de los trastornos alimentarios no están capacitados para detectar o investigar el posible uso indebido de sustancias de abuso.",

Elle entraîne des déficits cognitifs en impliquant probablement des processus neuroinflammatoires et épigénétiques. Toutefois, le mode d’action de l’alcool au cours des expositions initiales de type BD, est peu connu. Il pourrait pourtant être à l’origine de ces déficits cognitifs à long terme. Des études récentes, réalisées chez le rat adolescent, révèlent que la perte de mémoire se produit dès les premiers BD, avec des mécanismes similaires à ceux d’une exposition plus longue. L’initiation au BD chez le jeune serait donc responsable de déficits qui seront probablement entretenus par la répétition de cette pratique.

When substance use impairs life functioning and becomes a use disorder, regardless of the type of substance, effective treatments are available (e.g., medication to treat opioid and alcohol use disorders and behavioral approaches to treat tobacco, stimulant, and other substances). In two very different cultural contexts, the United States and Afghanistan, pregnant women face common issues when using substances and seeking and/or receiving help for problem substance use. In both countries, and around the world, many women who have substance use disorders during and after pregnancy face tremendous stigma and discrimination. Yet, similarly, in both the United States and Afghanistan, when women receive integrated medical and behavioral health care for their substance use disorder, they and their children have more optimized opportunities for healthy life outcomes.",

We can anticipate new medications being found to enhance penile erections. Maybe a pacemaker will be possible that will stimulate an erection. New methods will be developed to insert coils and scarring agents for veno-occlusive disorders. Drugs will be produced in the form of pills, creams, or injectables that will dilate, clean out, or prevent blockage in the arteries. Preventing erectile dysfunction should become the issue in the 1990s and the next century. Changes in life-style such as reducing stress, eating healthier, stopping smoking, exercising more, and reducing alcohol consumption will lead to better bodily functioning. Essentially, taking responsibility for our own well being will become important. Health promotion, instead of curing, will receive greater focus. Education will play an important part in realizing a goal of mature sexuality and improved general well-being.",

Follow-up studies tested steps of a potential mechanism: 1) people think drugs undermine free will 2) people believe addiction undermines free will more when doing so serves the self 3) disbelief in free will leads people to perceive various temptations as more addictive.People with lower belief in free will were more likely to have a history of addiction to alcohol and other drugs, and also less likely to have successfully quit alcohol. People believe that drugs undermine free will, and they use this belief to self-servingly attribute less free will to their bad actions than to good ones.

      "abstract": "There are multiple barriers to better understanding of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches and the use of natural substances to reduce cancer risk. CAM approaches are not patentable, and the pharmaceutical industry has no interest in the area. Research generally approaches concepts from the deconstructionist side: there may be interest in herbal mixtures but its \"active\" constituents are explored one at a time, missing any synergistic or even additive effects. Little attention has been paid to environmental pollutants and exposures. Most patients believe these are active causes of their disease, but researchers are still exposing animals to one chemical one time, which fails to duplicate human exposures. Attention to lifestyle issues is presented almost solely in terms of obesity--a concept that is a barrier to change by itself. Research animals rarely if ever are fed dietary components that humans normally eat, such as soda or diet soda, potato chips, and high-fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, artificial flavors, other additives, or combinations of bad fats with too much sugar, too much salt, and artificial ingredients. Long-term treatment effects on survivors may not necessarily require a solely pharmaceutical approach. Drugs to treat each condition separately may require even more drugs to offset the unwanted effects of each. Whole systems approaches to research are urgently needed. A final barrier is that once a treatment is accepted in mainstream, it ceases to be considered \"alternative.\" The genesis is soon forgotten and the remaining alternative modalities continue to be viewed with suspicion, doubt, and misunderstanding, to the detriment of both patients in treatment and cancer survivors.",

      "title": "The Predicted Impact of Reducing the Nicotine Content in Cigarettes on Alcohol Use",
      "abstract": "Product standards reducing the level of nicotine in cigarettes could significantly improve public health by reducing smoking behavior and toxicant exposure. However, relatively little is known about how the regulatory strategy could impact alcohol use, a closely related health behavior that is also a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. The primary objective of this paper is to predict the effect of nicotine reduction on alcohol use, identify priorities for future research, and highlight areas for mitigating any adverse outcomes. We critically reviewed and integrated literatures examining the effects of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes on smoking-related outcomes (nicotine exposure, nicotine withdrawal, and smoking as a cue to drink) and, in turn, the effects of those outcomes on alcohol use. Current evidence suggests reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes may benefit public health by reducing alcohol use and problematic drinking over time as a consequence of reduced exposure to nicotine and the smoking cues associated with drinking. Nicotine withdrawal could increase risk of drinking, although these effects should be short-lived and could be mitigated by other sources of nicotine. Gender, hazardous drinking, and psychiatric comorbidities are likely to be important moderators of the effects of VLNC cigarettes. It is imperative to broadly assess the public health impact of potential tobacco product regulations by including measures of closely related health behaviors that could be impacted by these interventions. Nicotine reduction in cigarettes may contribute to improved public health through reductions in alcohol use.",

      "abstract": "Picky eaters are people who avoid many new and familiar foods because they dislike the taste, smell, texture, or appearance of many foods. When it is severe, picky eating can lead to weight loss or difficulty maintaining a healthy weight, nutritional deficiencies, dependence on supplements to get adequate nutrition or calories, or shame, anxiety, or difficulty engaging in daily life. When severe picky eating leads to these consequences, it can be diagnosed as Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). People who restrict the amount of food they consume (or engage in exercise, purging, or fasting behaviors to get rid of calories after eating) because they are afraid of gaining weight or being fat are diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia when their eating leads to weight loss, nutritional problems, or interferes with life. ARFID is a new diagnosis, and in this paper, we show that 1) adults with ARFID symptoms are just as distressed, and just as likely to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder, as those with anorexia or bulimia, but that 2) adults with ARFID show very different types of eating behavior from adults with symptoms of anorexia or bulimia.",

      "abstract": "(Recibido: 2013/10/02 - Aceptado: 2013/12/13)Decenas de miles de trabajadores están expuestos a la contaminación ocasionada por neurotóxicos en los diferentes lugares de trabajo, en pequeños negocios, industrias artesanales e inclusive en el hogar. El problema se agrava debido, por una parte a la falta de información sobre los riesgos que presentan estas sustancias y las medidas de seguridad que deben adoptarse durante su uso, y por otro lado al exceso de confianza, que hace abstracción del peligro cuando se trata de exposiciones a pequeñas dosis de tóxico por desconocer los efectos acumulativos que producen estas sustancias cada vez que ingresan al organismo. En el Ecuador existen pocos estudios que caracterizan la exposición a estas sustancias y ninguno sobre la incidencia del síndrome neurotóxico, siendo un importante campo de investigación. Los trabajadores que están expuestos a sustancias químicas neurotóxicas se han asociado con efectos adversos en la salud humana, por su peculiar agresividad y porque comprometen la seguridad del trabajador antes de quebrantar directamente su salud. Ingresan en el organismo por vía respiratoria, dérmica o digestiva, presentan gran afinidad con las grasas por lo que se acumulan y afectan a los sistemas, órganos y tejidos grasos como el sistema nervioso central, la médula ósea y el hígado. Se han detectado efectos inmediatos (agudos) y a largo plazo (crónicos), dependiendo de la intensidad y duración de la exposición. Los síntomas son: somnolencia, pérdida del apetito, cefaleas, vértigo, depresión, ansiedad, nerviosismo, irritabilidad, fatiga, problemas de memoria, lentitud mental, convulsiones, descoordinación motora, alteraciones genéticas, entre otras.",

Alcohol use even in small amounts may be problematic for older adults with chronic illness or who use prescription medications. Older problem drinkers may be more difficult to identify as a result of poor screening instruments, failure of clinicians to consider alcoholism as a contributing diagnosis, problems defining excessive drinking, and difficulty separating alcohol symptoms from those caused by other diseases. While moderate alcohol consumption may be protective, heavy drinking has been linked to an increased risk of stroke, functional impairment, dementia and mortality.",

However, far too little attention has been given to the consequences of the use of social drugs such as ethanol and tobacco, which are by far the most commonly abused substances during pregnancy. While the deleterious effects of cocaine or amphetamines on the mother and the fetus are more pronounced and easier to detect, the addiction to ethanol and tobacco is usually subtle and more difficult to diagnose. As a result recreational use of alcohol and tobacco may continue undetected in pregnancy, significantly effecting pregnancy outcome and obstetric and anaesthetic management of these patients. This article reviews the consequences of ethanol and tobacco use in pregnancy and offers recommendation for anaesthetic management of these potentially complicated pregnancies.",

      "abstract": "Segun la ultima encuesta estatal sobre el uso de drogas en estudiantes de ensenanzas secundarias, el alcohol es la sustancia cuyo uso esta mas extendido entre los jovenes espanoles de 14 a 18 anos. Espana es uno de los paises con mayor consumo de alcohol por habitante y ano. Entre los factores de riesgo y proteccion en el consumo de sustancias destacan las variables relacionadas con la familia. Destacan como variables asociadas al consumo el clima familiar, las propias conductas de consumo por parte de los padres y su actitud hacia las drogas. Mientras que la actitud de los progenitores ante las drogas ilegales suele ser de claro rechazo, por lo general, hay mayor permisividad respecto al consumo de alcohol. El consumo por parte del grupo de amigos tambien resalta como un importante factor de riesgo, dado que la presion social favorece el consumo del adolescente. Los procesos de aprendizaje social o modelado intervienen en la adquisicion de todo tipo de comportamientos, y pueden favorecer el consumo de sustancias en los adolescentes, influyendo en su frecuencia e intensidad. Aunque la influencia del modelado social en el inicio del consumo esta respaldada por numerosas investigaciones, hay pocos datos acerca de la importancia de cada tipo de modelo. Por esa razon es conveniente examinar los factores psicologicos propuestos por la teoria del aprendizaje social que explica la adquisicion de habitos mediante la observacion de modelos (tabla 1 y fig. 1).",

      "title": "Help your patients with smoking cessation",
      "abstract": "Figure: Q: Why talk to my patients about smoking cessation when they already know smoking is an unhealthy practice?A: Most patients who smoke know that doing so is bad for their health. They've heard it countless times, but still they continue to smoke. The act of smoking isn't just a bad habit; it's a physiologic and psychological addiction. Nicotine dependence should be viewed as a chronic disease, with multiple possible comorbidities. The majority of patients who smoke cycle through multiple periods of relapse and remission, so smoking cessation counseling is needed for ongoing support of those who are trying to quit and also for those who've already quit. The single most important health decision a patient who smokes can make is to quit. Although 70% of those who smoke want to quit, only 3% are successful without smoking cessation intervention. Nurses are in a prime position to begin the process of motivating their patients to consider quitting during their admission assessment. At this beginning stage, two questions are critical: \"Do you smoke?\" and \"Do you want to quit?\" Although you may not be able to spend much time in cessation counseling with your patient, the mere suggestion of quitting may be enough to move him to action in the near future. In a nonjudgmental way you can provide resources for your patient to take home to use when he's ready to quit, even if he isn't ready to do so upon discharge. In addition to office-based or off-site counseling and community-based cessation classes, you may refer your patient to quit lines and print and Internet-based educational materials. You may also inform him about the option of pharmacotherapy to aid him in quitting. There are several free smoking cessation programs available online, such as those offered by the American Lung Association (http://www.lungusa.org/stop-smoking), the National Alliance for Tobacco Cessation (http://becomeanex.org), and Smokefree.gov. It's been shown that even a brief tobacco intervention is an effective motivator for the patient to begin thinking about quitting. For a patient who shows a willingness to quit, consider the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 5 A's model for treating tobacco use and dependence (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange follow-up). For a patient who shows an unwillingness to quit, consider the 5 R's model: Relevance: Encourage the patient to indicate why quitting is personally relevant. Risks: Identify potential negative consequences of tobacco use (acute, long-term, and environmental risks). Rewards: Identify potential benefits of stopping tobacco use, such as improved health, saving money, and better food taste. Roadblocks: Have the patient identify barriers to quitting and help him problem solve. Repetition: Repeat these steps at every visit. Who better to begin smoking cessation counseling than you as you care for your patients every day?",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCAO O uso abusivo de substâncias psicoativas como a cocaina e um grande problema de saude publica, e quando utilizada durante a gestacao compromete o crescimento e desenvolvimento da crianca. O uso desta substancia durante o periodo gestacional tem aumentado drasticamente durante as ultimas decadas. Em alguns casos o recem-nascido exposto a cocaina, aparentemente, nao apresenta qualquer tipo de comprometimento ou problemas neurologicos, entretanto, com o passar do tempo manifesta alteracoes que comprometem sua condicao fisica e neurologica.  OBJETIVO; Descrever o que a literatura tem apontado sobre o uso da cocaina por mulheres durante a gestacao e as consequencias para as criancas Metodologia: Trata-se de uma revisao da literatura. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSAO: A exposicao fetal diante a cocaina provoca diversos desfechos neonatais desfavoraveis para bebe, tanto fisiologica quanto psicologicamente. A literatura aponta como principais consequencias cefalicas reduzidas para a idade, dificuldade no ganho de peso e alteracoes no desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor, podendo acarretar disturbios comportamentais, de linguagem e deficit motor. Alem disso, a cocaina, suprime o apetite materno e coopera para deficiencia nutricional que, por conseguinte, prejudica os depositos de gordura fetais e diminui a massa corporal. CONCLUSAO: Destaca-se, o grande desafio aos profissionais de saude, em especial aqueles da Estrategia Saude da Familia em planejar estrategias de prevencao de drogas, em especial no periodo gestacional, bem como utilizar a Politica de Reducao de danos. Outro cuidado importante e o acompanhamento minucioso dos recem nascidos filhos de maes usuarias de cocaina, com vistas a deteccao precoce de alteracoes.  Aliado a isso, faz-se necessario o acolhimento e busca ativa dessas maes e suas criancas a fim de elaborar estrategias com foco na promocao da saude e a qualidade de vidas criancas, transmitindo informacoes sobre os riscos inerentes a cada fase do desenvolvimento infantil, Por fim, acredita-se que os resultados do presente estudo possam contribuir para o estabelecimento de acoes educativas e preventivas voltadas para uso de cocaina e as consequencias para crianca.",

      "abstract": "by Martha Rowe Nowadays the sedentary lifestyle is called “the second smoking.” It is implied that this little habit by insensible degrees breaks our health and, in significant amounts, even kills. Some recent studies revealed a direct connection between the sedentary lifestyle and emergence and development of such diseases as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and mental diseases. Meanwhile, busy exercises can positively change the whole system of our body. We can see (or feel) the result of doing sport almost immediately, but to have a more profound and more long-term effect, a person must be engaged in a game always throughout life. Studies have revealed that such physical exercises as running, aerobics, running fitness, swimming, cycling - all that trains the heart muscle, - have an extraordinary effect on the human heart. The exercises performed permanently over an extended period, cause a marked increase in heart rate (beats per minute) and stroke volume (the amount of blood coming out of the heart per pound). To increase the effect of exercises, you need to choose the type of activity that suits your purpose. No matter what training you do, the basic rule is “Don’t give up.” You can change the type of exercise depending on the purpose and mood, but the sport must always be present in your life. If the person stops, the entire health benefits from activities will ‘disappear’ in a few weeks.",

Subjects (4,148) were questioned about their use of benzodiazepines of whom 1,284 were also questioned about their alcohol, cigarette and caffeine consumption. Data were examined to find possible multiple substance misuse. No strong evidence could be found. People taking benozodiazepines at the time of the survey consumed significantly less alcohol than non‐users or past users. Cigarette consumption was found to be increased in current and past benzodiazepine users. Subgroups of benzodiazepine users, defined as‘high users’,‘dosage escalators’or‘chronic users’were also examined. Again no strong evidence of multiple substance misuse could be found. However, high users and dosage escalators did smoke more than others. Concurrent misuse of benzodiazepines and other legally available psychoactive substances is not common in the general population.",

Malgrat la reduccio de la prevalenca en poblacio general, el consum de tabac en individus amb TMS roman invariable. Les falses creences poden ser responsables del baix nivell d’intervencio en tabaquisme en aquests pacients. L’evidencia suggereix que els individus amb TMS volen deixar de fumar i es beneficiarien de fer-ho. Els programes intensius i flexibles poden ser eficacos perque aquests usuaris redueixin el consum o assoleixin l’abstinencia tabaquica. Objectiu: Avaluar l’eficacia d’una intervencio intensiva a l’Hospital de Dia de Salut Mental (HDSM). \nMaterial i Metode: Estudi quasi-experimental. Es porta a terme un programa multicomponent amb una sessio grupal setmanal de 60 minuts per abordar el tabaquisme. Durant les entrevistes individuals, intervencio en sensibilitzacio, reduccio i/o cessacio de manera personalitzada utilitzant l’entrevista motivacional. Resultats: Index de dependencia a la nicotina alt en un 14,3%, mitja en un 47,6% i baix en un 38,1%. Respecte a la reduccio del consum de tabac un 38,1% va aconseguir l’abstinencia, un 23,8% reduccio de mes de la meitat, un 14,3% de menys de la meitat i un 23,8% va mantenir el consum. \nConclusions: Considerant la millora en l’esperanca i qualitat de vida aixi com la favorable relacio cost-benefici, el tractament de la dependencia del tabac es fonamental pels pacients amb TMS. L’HDSM es un recurs que facilita l’abordatge del tabaquisme per les seves caracteristiques: tractament intensiu, integral i individualitzat.",

      "abstract": "To examine the effect of the relationship between alcohol and cigarette consumption on biological aging using deoxyribonucleic acid methylation-based indices.Hierarchical linear regression modeling followed by fitting of higher-order effects.Longitudinal studies of aging and the effect of psychosocial stress.Participants in two ethnically informative cohorts (n = 656 white, n = 180 black).Deviation of biological age from chronological age as a result of smoking and alcohol consumption.Greater cigarette consumption was associated with accelerated biological aging, with strong effects evident at even low levels of exposure. In contrast, alcohol consumption was associated with a mixed effect on biological aging and pronounced nonlinear effects. At low and heavy levels of alcohol consumption, there was accelerated biological aging, whereas at intermediate levels of consumption there was a relative decelerating effect. The decelerating effects of alcohol were particularly notable at loci for which methylation increased with age.These data support prior epidemiological studies indicating that moderate alcohol use is associated with healthy aging, but we urge caution in interpreting these results. Conversely, smoking has strong negative effects at all levels of consumption. These results also support the use of methylomic indices as a tool for assessing the impact of lifestyle on aging.",

      "title": "Marijuana use: neuroscience perspective",
      "abstract": "The human behavioral repertoire includes activities that influence mood and cognition such as listening to music, watching movies, conversation, and dining, behaviors considered within the normal spectrum; however, when we choose activities that predictably and reliably alter our mood and cognition by exposing our central nervous system to exogenous molecules, we enter the potentially pathological path of addiction. We, and others around us, begin to worry as these behaviors insidiously become dominant foci in our existence. We do not clearly understand why a given individual chooses to use recreational drugs (1). As a society, we interpret and judge substance use based on our cultural prejudices, current moral and legal standards, and established norms.\r\n\r\nToday, with varying levels of acceptance throughout the world, the four, most abused, psychoactive substances are: caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis. Often, when individuals abuse one of these substances, they eventually migrate to using all four. Cannabis recently has gained significant social acceptance. People believe cannabis is benign, has few significant detrimental brain effects, and is also non-addicting. These are false popular misconceptions (2). Although the human brain naturally produces and uses cannabis-like molecules, referred to as endocannabinoids, current scientific data show that marijuana’s externally administered substances directly influence behavior by affecting brain functions (3).\r\n\r\nThe human endogenous endocannabinoid system indicates that natural substances that contain cannabis-like molecules will interact with the nervous system through existing receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are present in the peripheral cells such as the immune cells and neurons of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, cerebellum, basal ganglia, periaqueductal gray, hippocampus, and neocortex (4). In the central nervous system, these neuronal receptors play a significant role in modulating behaviors and brain functions. Data suggest that cannabinoid receptors play a more direct role in brain functions such as pain modulation, motor activity, reduced rapid eye-movement sleep, as well as mood, motivation, and higher cognitive processes (5). Their impact may combine direct and indirect cellular and network effects. The cannabinoid system’s neurotransmitter molecules are atypically synthesized in the cellular membrane by a complex enzymatic process of dendritic lipid metabolism (receptive and integrative structure of the neurons) (6). Although they behave similarly to classical neurotransmitter systems, unlike many other classical neurotransmitters, these neurotransmitter molecules are not stored in specialized vesicles. Current published data suggest that the endocannabinoid nervous system’s primary effect is to influence neurotransmitter release through presynaptic modulations. Endocannabinoid receptors have been characterized in two different receptor types, type-1 and type- 2 (7,8). Type-1 receptors are primarily found in the central nervous system, whereas type-2 receptors are thought to be primarily distributed to the peripheral system. Current data also show that type-1 receptors are closely associated with excitatory neurotransmitters. Based on how these receptors relatively distribute within a given system that contains inhibitory and excitatory neurons, type-1 receptor activation may cause either inhibition or excitation that may translate to physiologic seizure inhibition or facilitation, which is considered pathological neuronal activity (9,10). Receptor distribution may vary from person to person; therefore, based on cannabis use, we may expect individually defined, variable effects that eventually translate into unexpected behaviors.\r\n\r\nMarijuana and marijuana extracts are not only used recreationally: cannabis has a long history of medical treatment of various medical and neurological illnesses. Although recently it has gained the attention of research, the biochemical analysis of marijuana’s bioactive extracts is moving forward; this may give researchers significant understanding of the endocannbinoid system and how to develop new therapeutic agents that target that system. Already, significant advances have been made in managing chronic pain, glaucoma, head injury inflammatory disorders, and nausea, to mention a few (11).\r\n\r\nDespite marijuana’s tremendous medical potential, this drug’s recreational use presents medical and social problems (12-14). Recreational cannabis use has significantly increased throughout the world (15). As marijuana’s public acceptance increases, the age of marijuana exposure decreases. In the US, data indicate that while nicotine use has decreased among college students, cannabinoid use has increased. In the light of these findings, we must ask ourselves whether there are significant consequences for chronic cannabis use. We also need to ask about the frequency of cannabis use and its direct impact on brain function. In recent years, as marijuana’s quality has improved, the higher cannabinoid concentration has resulted in significantly increased potency. Cannabinoid concentration has increased up to five times, which has increased its biological effect on the brain and, more significantly, endangered vulnerable individuals.\r\n\r\nEmerging behavioral and imaging data argue against recreational marijuana use because they show a relationship between the age of first use and the intensity of measurable consequences. Individuals who routinely use marijuana have significantly altered brain structures and functions with significantly altered cognition and mood regulation. Relative to non users, chronic marijuana users generally underperform in memory and cognitive tasks; in addition, chronic marijuana users may develop significant mood deregulation that presents as depression, anxiety, and may result in long-lasting amotivational syndrome. Current data are unclear about the duration of these effects. More alarming data argue that some chronic marijuana users can develop psychosis that, in some cases, may lead to significant chronic psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders (16).\r\n\r\nWho are these vulnerable individuals? Although we have limited data regarding this issue, some trends are emerging. Indeed, it appears that a subpopulation of individuals may be particularly vulnerable to marijuana use. In these individuals, certain brain molecules have altered genetic regulation of certain neurotransmitters that include dopamine (17). This makes these individuals more likely to develop psychosis and potentially more vulnerable to developing chronic mental illness because these brain molecules help eliminate dopamine after its release. In addition to genetic vulnerability, it appears there is a well-defined window linked to age: Individuals who engaged in heavy marijuana use before age 17 are five times more likely to abuse other substances later in life (18). Furthermore, these vulnerabilities indicate that marijuana use may lead to future cognitive difficulty such as lower IQ and psychiatric symptoms (19).\r\n\r\nMany researchers would agree that pre-teen, teen, and young adult marijuana use may be significantly detrimental to brain development and, consequently, to successful participation in life. Emerging data show that chronic marijuana users performed poorly in school, often found themselves in conflict with the law, and did not progress as expected in developing their interests and careers. One proposed hypothesis states that marijuana use leads to decreased motivation and decreased ability to focus, pay attention, form memories, and solve complex problems. It is becoming clear that chronic marijuana use impacts emotions as well as cognition and affects structures such as the hippocampus, critical for memory formation and retrieval; the amygdala, critical for the emotional brain; and the frontal lobes, critical for the executive brain (20).\r\n\r\nLastly, but not surprisingly, recreational marijuana use and other substance use such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol may significantly impair the performance and socially beneficial activity of our youth. As the youth become young adults and attempt to manage new challenges and the responsibilities of independence, they often face significant periods of stress. Their successful transition through these periods requires cognitive and emotional stability. Without these resources, when they face challenges, young adults often seek easy immediate solutions. If substance use is in their historical behavioral repertoire, they turn to substances for relief and as a solution for their problems. These behaviors tend to be strongly reinforcing and often result in a viscous cycle of addiction. Unfortunately, we currently cannot predict who will withstand the challenges addiction, who will move-on unharmed, or who may be doomed to lifelong struggles and significant psychiatric sequels.\r\n\r\nIt appears we cannot prevent experimentation with addictive substances; however, we can invest in effective biological education about addiction and its potential consequences. We also need to have open, honest, evidence-based, public, conversations that address the individual risks of substance use and abuse.",

      "abstract": "O uso de cigarros eletrônicos tem sido tradicionalmente percebido como inofensivo, com tendências recentes mostrando um aumento no uso não só entre fumantes, como também entre não fumantes, principalmente quando se trata adolescentes e jovens adultos. Esses dispositivos possuem nicotina que, comprovadamente, tem ação direta sobre o sistema cardiovascular. Entretanto, eles também contêm outros produtos químicos nocivos, como metais e substâncias como cádmio, cromo, chumbo, níquel e silicatos. Assim, estudos recentes estão evidenciando efeitos agudos do uso de cigarros eletrônicos na pressão arterial e na frequência cardíaca, bem como nos parâmetros de rigidez arterial. Nesse sentido, o atual estudo tem como objetivo comparar, de forma quantitativa, a resposta da frequência cardíaca e da pressão arterial durante teste de esforço máximo em esteira ergométrica entre três grupos, sendo eles compostos por usuários de cigarros eletrônicos, usuários de outros tipos de cigarros com nicotina e não fumantes saudáveis. Foram excluídos do estudo indivíduos com doença física ou mental incapacitante, os considerados “sedentários” pelo questionário internacional de aptidão física (iPAQ) versão curta, obesos (IMC 30 Kg/m2), indivíduos com pressão arterial sistólica (PAS) 140 mmHg e pressão arterial diastólica (PAD) 90 mmHg e/ou frequência cardíaca (FC) em repouso 99 bpm. Logo, no presente estudo, não houve diferença estatisticamente significativa entre as variações FC entre os grupos e todos os participantes atingiram 85% da FC máxima esperada, fato que pode ser justificado pela amostra ser composta de indivíduos jovens, entre 18 e 30 anos, sendo a maioria deles considerados ativos ou muito ativos. Contudo, foi encontrado uma tendência à diferença entre os Deltas da PAS e PAD, sugerindo uma melhor resposta dessas variáveis no grupo controle, apesar de que não se obteve diferença estaticamente significativa entre os grupos. Em acréscimo, no momento final da fase de recuperação (Rec 6), os grupos compostos por fumantes de cigarros eletrônicos e de outros tipos de cigarro não retornaram aos valores da PA do repouso, variação que foi alcançada pelo grupo controle. Muitos estudos relacionam a recuperação lenta da PAS pós-esforço com a presença de doença arterial coronariana. O presente estudo teve como limitação uma amostra pequena e a dificuldade para encontrar jovens que fumam apenas cigarros classificados em “outros tipos de cigarro”, como o cigarro industrializado, cigarro de palha ou tabaco. Dessa forma, estudos com amostras maiores e/ou estudos logitudinais são fundamentais para se desvendar os efeitos dos cigarros eletrônicos no sistema cardiovascular tanto a curto, quanto a longo prazo. Todavia, mesmo na necessidade de mais pesquisas, os malefícios do cigarro eletrônico já elucidados cientificamente são suficientes para embasar campanhas que desincentivem o uso.",

      "title": "[Tobacco control experience in the debate on marijuana legalisation].",
      "abstract": "LEGALIZZAZIONE DI MARIJUANA E TABACCO Il divieto di vendita della marijuana ha molte conseguenze negative, come la detenzione di giovani per possesso di quantita medie di marijuana e lo sviluppo del mercato illegale che a sua volta genera crimine, violenza e corruzione. Se la vendita venisse legalizzata, la tassazione della marijuana produrrebbe entrate per lo stato e potrebbe essere utilizzata senza problemi a scopo terapeutico. La marijuana, infatti, ha importanti effetti terapeutici: riduce nausea e vomito durante i trattamenti oncologici, riduce la perdita di appetito nella sindrome da deperimento nell’AIDS, ha effetti analgesici (trattamento del dolore cronico neuropatico) e antispasmodici (sclerosi multipla).1 Sicuramente il fumo di marijuana e meno mortale del fumo di tabacco e determina una dipendenza piu bassa. Infatti, solo il 9% di utilizzatori di cannabis rispondono ai criteri di dipendenza riportati nel Manuale diagnostico e statistico dei disturbi mentali (DSM-5), rispetto al 32% dei fumatori di tabacco.2 Ci sono, comunque, importanti effetti sulla salute. Coloro che dall’adolescenza fumano marijuana per ≥4 giorni la settimana perdono 8 punti nel quoziente intellettivo nell’arco di 25 anni, tra i 13 e i 38 anni.3 L’uso regolare nell’adolescenza e associato ad abbandono e basso rendimento scolastico. In coloro che ne fanno uso da molti anni sono documentati deficit di attenzione, memoria e apprendimento verbale. L’uso regolare, inoltre, e associato a sintomi psicotici ed e considerato un fattore di rischio per l’insorgenza di schizofrenia.1 Inoltre, i fumatori di marijuana possono avere molti sintomi della bronchite cronica dei fumatori di tabacco. Nel piu recente studio di coorte su circa 50.000 svedesi seguiti per 40 anni, i forti consumatori di marijuana (>50 volte nella loro vita) hanno un rischio piu che doppio di sviluppare tumore del polmone, anche dopo aver aggiustato per fumo di tabacco, condizione socioeconomica, uso di alcol e condizioni respiratorie.4 Negli altri studi sul tumore del polmone, i risultati sono inconsistenti per brevita del follow-up, bassa numerosita, uso di marijuana non indagato approfonditamente. Per altre sedi tumorali i risultati sono insufficienti per una valutazione adeguata dell’impatto della marijuana sul rischio cancerogeno.5 D’altronde anche il tabacco non e stato tanto letale e capace di determinare dipendenza come lo e oggi.6 Nel 1880 pochi usavano il tabacco, in particolare le sigarette, e le morti attribuibili a tabacco erano poche. Negli anni Cinquanta-Settanta del secolo scorso oltre il 50% degli uomini italiani fumavano sigarette e, qualche decennio dopo, il tumore del polmone e diventato una delle cause piu frequenti di morte negli uomini e, recentemente, anche nelle donne. Questa trasformazione del tabacco da prodotto di nicchia a prodotto di massa e avvenuta attraverso innovazioni effettuate dall’industria del tabacco. Nel tempo l’industria ha sviluppato sigarette meno irritanti tramite la sostituzione del tabacco burley con quello virginia (sigarette bionde), tramite lo sviluppo di nuovi procedimenti di cura e l’introduzione del filtro. Come effetto di questi cambiamenti, i fumatori hanno iniziato a inalare piu profondamente, facilitando cosi l’assorbimento polmonare per velocizzare l’arrivo della nicotina al cervello. Questi ben documentati procedimenti di ingegnerizzazione della sigaretta hanno determinato un aumento del potenziale di dipendenza del tabacco e un aumento dell’assorbimento di tossine e cancerogeni. Oltretutto, l’industria ha aggiunto sostanze per migliorare il sapore e velocizzare ulteriormente l’assorbimento, senza tener conto degli effetti sulla salute che tali additivi hanno.6 Secondo alcuni esperti di tobacco control,7-9 nel dibattito sulla legalizzazione non e stato ancora considerato il potenziale effetto dell’entrata delle multinazionali del tabacco (o di altre societa, come le industrie alimentari e delle bevande) nel mondo della marijuana legalizzata, con il loro potere di marketing e la capacita di progettare sigarette di marijuana per massimizzare il rilascio di tetraidrocannabinolo (THC), allo stesso modo di come hanno fatto per le sigarette attuali di tabacco. Insomma, l’industria ha il potere di cambiare radicalmente ed espandere l’uso della marijuana.",

While there are many substances used that might be considered ineffectual or physiologic, the two main categories of substances considered as doping agents are stimulants and anabolic steroids. No substance is as yet known that will improve an athlete's performance. Often such substances are taken in error rather than in a misguided attempt to improve one's ability. These substances can be dangerous and, because of this, doping rules were established basically to protect the athlete. Anabolic steroids are particularly dangerous; they usually are taken by those engaged in lifting or throwing sports in an attempt to improve performance by increasing muscle bulk. There is as yet no scientific proof that performance is improved. Dope testing for stimulants should be carried out in a quantitative rather than qualitative manner so that the athlete who has taken a small amount of a so-called stimulant (such as an asthma or common cold preparation) would not be excluded from competition. Rigid testing for anabolic steroids should be continued.",

Case presentation We present a case with alcohol use disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, who developed a substance use disorder to bupropion while chewing it in doses up to 2250 mg, in an attempt to get “high” with no history of seizures. Discussion Our case suggests that bupropion can also be misused by chewing even at high doses and that it can lead to a substance use disorder. Its use in various indications in treating mental disorders and its over-the-counter accessibility, along with a lower risk of stigmatization, could increase the prevalence of bupropion misuse. It is essential to know the medical consequences of bupropion misuse as there is increasing data on its addictive potential. More information is needed to clarify the impact of the route of administration on drug metabolism and adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Antecedentes. Objetivo. Describir los componentes de las bebidas energizantes y analizar los efectos, reacciones indeseables y precauciones frente a su uso. Material y metodos. Se realizo una revision de la literatura en Pubmed con los terminos MeSH: caffeine OR taurine OR gluconates en combinacion con el termino energy drinks con especificadores encontrando 42 articulos, se analizaron los resumenes y se incluyeron 29 articulos. Resultados. Las bebidas energizantes se componen de metilxantinas, carbihodratos, taurina, vitaminas y/o guarana. La mayoria de los efectos estimulantes son a expensas de las altas concentraciones de metilxantinas como la cafeina. Estas altas concentraciones aumentan el riesgo de intoxicacion y dependencia a la cafeina. Se han reportado casos de arritmias, infartos cardiacos, exacerbacion de sintomatologia psiquiatrica y presencia de crisis convulsivas asociadas a su consumo. Ademas, la mezcla con alcohol aumenta los danos relacionados con la intoxicacion alcoholica. Por los efectos diureticos y cardiovasculares no se recomiendan en deportistas. Conclusiones. Se evidencia que los componentes de las bebidas energizantes no son completamente inocuos. Aunque no se conocen los efectos cronicos, la literatura advierte el dano a la salud que puede producirse con la ingesta aguda fuerte o con el consumo frecuente. Es necesario implementar medidas dirigidas a informar las consecuencias de estas sustancias y restringir su consumo en poblaciones de riesgo.",

Ill effects of Secondhand smoking are more commonly underrated in the society. Side stream smoking also causes hazardous health effects. Smoking not only affects the smoker, but also affects non-smokers and children. Passive smokers are people exposed to cigarette smoke in two ways : by direct exposure to the smoke of passively burning cigarette and exposure to the smoke breathed out by the smoker. Second-hand smoke is the mixture of direct smoke from burning a cigarette along with the smoke breathed out from the smoker’s lungs. As a result, side stream smoke has higher concentration of some toxic and carcinogenic substances than the mainstream smoke. When exposed to second hand smoke, non-smokers inhale 60-80% of airborne nicotine similar to that absorbed by smokers So this review paper will elaborate about the effects of passive smoking.",

En la actualidad, su consumo es un problema de salud publica, especialmente en la zona de Los Andes. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha, no se han estudiado los factores asociados al inicio de este habito. Por ello, se realizo un estudio cualitativo para describir los factores que motivan al inicio del consumo de chimo en un grupo de pacientes que acuden a consulta en la Facultad de Odontologia de la Universidad de Los Andes. Los resultados de esta investigacion, mostraron que los pacientes se iniciaron en el consumo de esta sustancia, motivados por familiares, amigos y companeros de trabajo. Al ser esta una practica comun en su entorno de vida cotidiana, su consumo y uso se percibe como normal, especialmente para las multiples aplicaciones clinicas. Por lo general tiene un significado que transciende el habito sin sentido. Reproduce, de alguna manera, las practicas socioculturales de los ancestros. Se sugiere explorar los factores asociados al consumo de chimo en consumidores que interactuen predominantemente en zonas urbanas.",

      "abstract": "Although most women report alcohol use, women generally are light drinkers. Those who drink and drink heavily are more likely to be young, white, single, to have a higher education and income, and to be employed outside the home. However, women who drink during pregnancy, and particularly, those who continue to drink through the third trimester are different. They are older, more likely to be black, and they have higher rates of illicit drug use, less education, and lower social status. Marijuana and cocaine are used less frequently. However, women of childbearing age have the highest rates of use for both these drugs. Women who use marijuana during pregnancy are more often black, unmarried, and of lower social class. Cocaine users tend to be black, older, unmarried, and also of lower socioeconomic status. Both groups more frequently use other illicit drugs and, in general, receive less prenatal care. Therefore, for alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine, the highest rates of use are found among women of childbearing age. The women most likely to use substances during pregnancy are women who also have other characteristics that are, in themselves, significant risk factors for poor pregnancy outcome. These covariates must be considered in the evaluation of the effects of prenatal substance use.",

It may be an indicator of emotional disturbance, or may be associated with several other health risk behaviours in adolescence.

Health professionals are increasingly being exposed to teenagers who use alcohol and drugs. The following article aims to provide, based on clinical and research experience in a number of institutions in Melbourne, Australia, an overview of the epidemiology of adolescent drug use, a clinical approach to assess substance use in young people and the principles of management of drug use in adolescence.",

      "abstract": "As a growing number of people use e-cigarettes regularly, it becomes increasingly important to understand the psychobiological effects of vaping. This chapter reviews evidence into these effects. Nicotine e-cigarettes influence all major systems in the body. For instance, vaping increases dopamine activity in the brain's reward pathway, raises heart rate and blood pressure, and may dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. These physiological changes have psychological consequences for addiction, cognition, mood, anxiety and appetite. First, e-cigarettes appear more addictive than nicotine replacement therapy, such as patches and gum, but less so than cigarettes. E-cigarettes that use nicotine salts deliver nicotine more efficiently, so may be more addictive. Second, vaping may lead to short-term improvements in cognitive performance, as nicotine can improve memory and attention. Third, e-cigarette users report mood enhancing and anxiety reducing effects of vaping, but these effects may result from the alleviation of withdrawal symptoms. Further research will help determine whether vaping causes depression and anxiety, or vice versa. Finally, vaping likely suppresses appetite and reduces weight gain.",

      "title": "Public health and drugs: why is policy so persistently irrational?",
      "abstract": "Drug control is one of public health's most conspicuous failures, a glaring exception to more rational policies in fields like immunization. Despite occasional disagreements over means, such as oral versus injectable polio vaccine, officials share a consistent goal: safely vaccinating as many people against as many serious infections as possible. They don’t include measles and exclude mumps. Yet drug policy remains fractious and, given the consequences of alcohol and tobacco use, seemingly irrational. The reason is straightforward. Two opposing forces, moralism and commercialism, have long whipsawed drug policy. Many people regard non-medical drug use as sinful, threatening to children and a fit object for prohibition—period. Room (2003) refers to the ‘aesthetics’ of pleasure-generating activities, but, for moralists, the question really boils down to suppressing vice. The prohibitory impulse tends to produce over-regulation, most often of drugs with counter-cultural or minority connections. Then there are entrepreneurs who view drugs as commodities the government should tax rather than forbid. The profit impulse (and the politicians who see fiscal salvation in it) tends to produce under-regulation. Alcohol and tobacco, commodities whose production, distribution and consumption generate millions of jobs and recurrent billions in revenue, are the most obvious cases. More than anything else, their economic import and cultural inertia explain the inconsistencies of drug policy. (Caffeine, the other great licit psychoactive commodity, has escaped regulation for a more basic reason: its intoxicating and adverse health effects are minimal compared with those of alcohol and tobacco.) Room's most interesting point is that globalization threatens to further weaken licit drug controls. Alcohol and tobacco generate profits and externalities, both distributed unevenly. It is tempting to concentrate the profits at higher levels of government, through expanded trade and increased tax revenues, letting provincial and local governments police up the human wreckage. National politicians who would otherwise resist cost-shifting policies may have to yield anyway if international trade agreements restrict their ability to regulate the commerce. Distributive effects play a comparable role in the class politics of illicit drug control. American suburban voters know that enforcement is expensive. They also know that the drug war is concentrated in inner-city neighborhoods. Strong sanctions against hard-drug sales and use amount to a general anti-crime policy, the effects of which are chiefly borne by those who shouldn’t be messing with drugs anyway. This attitude may not be fair, but, from the narrow standpoint of class interest, it is hardly irrational. As neuroscience trickles into our consciousness, Room suggests, the evidence that drugs affect the brain in similar ways will lead to a more convergent policy, ending the double standard. It's a hopeful thought; but, for a historian of drug commerce, it's about as likely a near-term prospect as the state withering away under proletarian rule. My bet is that real progress, if any, will come on the tobacco front. The multinational tobacco companies’ penetration of developing markets has created a crisis atmosphere, a situation reminiscent of the growing concern over narcotics trafficking in the early 20th century. The epidemiological evidence also weighs more heavily against tobacco. Cigarettes are poison. Alcoholic beverages confer some nutritional and coronary benefits. Though easily exaggerated, the distinction is a public-relations dream, one the alcohol industry will exploit in its rearguard action against stricter regulation.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking will kill literally millions of people annually around the world. Despite this fact, prevalence among young people remains unacceptably high. Because tobacco is so addictive, the typical adolescent smoker can look forward to a lifetime addiction, reduced quality of life and premature death. A long‐term solution to this problem must include action to postpone or inhibit adolescents from taking up smoking. Advertising research indicates that a message is more effective if the target audience experiences a feeling of involvement in it. It must also communicate new, important information that engages the audience at a cognitive and affective level and is readily verifiable against the audience’s own experience. It follows that the threat of addiction should be used as the key message in a campaign to reduce the incidence of adolescent cigarette smoking. This threat is potentially salient for adolescents. It is concrete and immediate, not merely a promise of increased statistical probabilities 30 or more years into the future. It is also readily verifiable from the adolescent’s own experience. It may also be worth focusing on other consequent losses that flow from the addiction.",

The use of the term \"addict\" increased over time. The 1964 U.S. Surgeon‐General’s Report claim that tobacco smoking was merely a \"habit\" temporarily inhibited public discussion of addiction.

      "title": "The Smoking Habit 1",
      "abstract": "Nobody ever quits smoking—except perhaps in Mark Twain's sense of having done so hundreds of times—simply because habits are permanent. The \"ex\"-smoker may for a while \"cut down to zero\" and may even continue at that frequency for the rest of his life, but he is irrevocably different from the never-smoker. One of the most obvious ways to prove the difference is to let both smoke a few cigarettes: the latter may treat it as a lark, while the former may resume habitual smoking. And there are more subtle behavioral differences between the two, such as their emotional reactions to the smoking behavior of others. The principle that habits (as I shall develop the term) are permanent has important practical implications if one wants to control any behavior, such as smoking. Most obviously, preventing the habit from being formed in the first place is the only way permanently to 132eliminate it. And less obviously, smokers should be accepted for what they are.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most common illegal drug in Sweden today. It is used by millions of people all over the world and has been used for thousands of years. The purpose with this essay is to try to understand why people smoke cannabis. To be able to answer the main questions, five persons who smoke cannabis regularly have been interviewed. Information has also been obtained from prior research in the same subject and other literature. To increase the ability to understand and explain why the interviewees smoke cannabis the existential psychology has been used when the result of the interviewees have been analysed. The interviewees have said that smoking cannabis helps them to be able to relax and to calm down. They have also told things that has shown why they have difficulties relaxing. The conclusion of this study is that cannabis can be used to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. These feelings can arise when the individual stands in front of a choice in life or when he has difficulties in finding purpose and meaning in life. Poor self-image is the result when the individual is repeatedly dissatisfied with his efforts and this causes negative feelings to emerge. The individual can choose to try to run from these negative feelings by smoking cannabis.",

Kebiasaan minum minuman keras bagi para remaja bermula karena kurangnya informasi dan kesalahpahaman informasi, termakan iklan atau terbujuk rayuan teman. Banyak yang beranggapan bahwa meminum minuman keras dapat menghilangkan stress. Namun hal ini sangat tidak dibenarkan.

      "title": "Carrot Addiction",
      "abstract": "Objective: A case report of carrot addiction is presented with a review of the literature and comment on the role of beta carotene in addictive behaviour. Clinical Picture: The addiction occurred in a 49-year-old woman under conditions of stress due to marital problems, leading to a depressive illness and increased smoking. The patient maintained that the sensations of carrot craving and withdrawal were quite distinct from those associated with smoking. Treatment: The patient was advised to record her daily carrot consumption. Outcome: The patient did not return for several months, but stopped eating carrots after an operation, at which time she also stopped smoking. Conclusion: Compusive carrot eating, regarded as a rare condition, has received scant documentation, unlike hypercarotenemia due to unusual diets or food fads. Nervousness, craving, insomnia, waterbrash and irritability are associated with withdrawal from excessive carrot eating. The basis for the addiction is believed to be beta carotene, found in carrots. Does carrot eating, an aggressively oral activity, merely act as a behavioural substitute for smoking? Or does beta carotene contain a chemical element that replicates the addictive component of nicotine? Further study of this unusual but intriguing addiction may reveal more about the basis of all addictions, with particular implications for the cessation of cigarette smoking.",

Las drogas más utilizadas en universitarios en nuestro país, están la marihuana seguida de cocaína entre otras.Los tratamientos habituales se dirigen a bloquear y revertir los efectos de la droga específica y prevenir la recaída durante la abstinencia, así como otros tienen el objeto de causar aversión, la psicoterapia es un pilar fundamental. Sin embargo las tasas de recaídas son altas, es más en el caso de la cocaína, no existe al momento un medicamento específico para la adicción o la sobredosis a la cocaína.

The drugs most used in university students of our country, are marijuana followed by cocaine between others.The usual treatments are directed to block and offset the effects of specific drugs and prevent relapse during abstinence, and others are intended to cause aversion, psychotherapy is a fundamental mainstay. However, relapse rates are high. It is higher in the case of cocaine, currently there is no a specific treatment for cocaine addiction or overdose. In this case, the immunotherapy appears as a safe and effective complementary therapy, although with limitations such as availability only of preclinical studies. Biological do not improve the craving or withdrawal symptoms, but its development could contribute to the management of substance use disorders. Vaccines have been shown as a part of the treatment not only of infections but also of conditions such as substance use disorders.",

      "title": "Use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy in Young People Entering Custody in New South Wales, Australia",
      "abstract": "Haysom et al. found low rates of uptake and compliance with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) among young people who smoke tobacco entering correctional facilities.1 As the authors note, this is not surprising and reflects the findings of other studies.2 Management of nicotine dependence in adolescence is problematic. NRT has not been shown to be effective in this age group and bupropion and varenicline are not approved. In the study by Haysom et al., the fixed dose of nicotine used was probably inadequate for many smokers as only 14 mg or 7 mg patches were used. Combination NRT (nicotine patch combined with a quick acting product such as nicotine gum or lozenge) is considered best practice but was not available. Other options, which are more acceptable to young smokers, are clearly needed to manage nicotine dependence in custody. One novel but controversial form therapy which is popular among young smokers is electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).3 These battery-operated devices heat nicotine liquid into a vapour for inhalation and can alleviate cigarette cravings and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Unlike nicotine patches, the dose of nicotine can be titrated to individual needs. As well as delivering nicotine, e-cigarettes can satisfy the behavioural and sensory aspects of the smoking ritual. Furthermore, as there is no combustion, e-cigarettes are substantially safer than smoking tobacco.4 Special disposable e-cigarettes have been designed for high security environments and are being used in prisons in the UK and USA. They can provide long-term substitution for combustible cigarettes in custody and may help to prevent relapse to smoking after release. E-cigarettes may be a more acceptable solution than existing treatments for managing nicotine dependence in young people in custody, especially when other treatments are refused or are not effective.",

Het inlassen van Beweegmomentjes in het werk is daarom een nieuw advies van TNO en het Nederlands Instituut voor Sport en Bewegen (NISB) voor werknemers die tijdens hun werk langdurig zitten. Wat zijn Beweegmomentjes? Staand telefoneren bijvoorbeeld, of naar een collega lopen in plaats van hem of haar te mailen. Staand of wandelend lunchen in plaats van zittend of gaan staan als een collega aan je bureau komt om even te overleggen. Naast te weinig sporten en bewegen, vormt ook langdurig zitten een risico op gezondheidsklachten voor de ruim 3 miljoen mensen in Nederland met een ‘zittend’ beroep. Kantoormedewerkers, chauffeurs, maar bijvoorbeeld ook laboranten. Ook al sporten en bewegen deze mensen misschien voldoende in hun vrije tijd, er is toch een risico op gezondheidsklachten als de functie of het beroep periodes van langdurig zitten omvat die zij niet regelmatig onderbreken. Boodschap is: iedereen die door de dag heen regelmatig langer dan een half uur achter elkaar zit, is gebaat bij het inlassen van Beweegmomentjes. Uit de eerste studies komt een voorlopige vuistregel: onderbreek het zitten een keer per half uur voor minimaal twee minuten. Het belangrijkste daarbij is opstaan en de benen in actie brengen. Het effect van Beweegmomentjes. Werknemers die niet lang achtereen zitten of het zitten regelmatig onderbreken hebben een kleinere kans op ernstige chronische ziekten zoals diabetes type II (suikerziekte) en op overgewicht. Beweegmomentjes kunnen dus bijdragen aan een betere gezondheid! Benieuwd of u voldoende beweegt op het werk: doe de test.",

Despite knowing the disastrous consequences involved in drinking, time and time again the alcoholic of whatever class or station will resort to alcohol. This is often directly against the person's will and contrary to promises sincerely made. Sometimes alcoholism has a human being so much in its grip that, although the complaint may be obvious to others, the alcoholic cannot see the nature of his or her condition or the possibility of a way out. So strong is the process of denial that often alcoholics are the last to realise that drinking is a problem, if they come to this realisation at all.",

      "title": "The Impact of E-Cigarettes on Oral and Dental Health: Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "E-cigarettes, also known as electronic cigarettes or vape pens, have become increasingly popular in recent years as an alternative to traditional tobacco products. However, there is growing concern about the potential impact of e-cigarettes on oral and dental health. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the current evidence on the topic and to highlight the potential risks associated with e-cigarette use. One of the main concerns surrounding e-cigarettes is the potential for oral and dental health problems. E-cigarettes contain a liquid solution that is heated and inhaled as a vapor, and this vapor can contain a variety of chemicals and toxins. Some of these chemicals have been found to have adverse effects on oral health, including inflammation of the gums, dry mouth, and an increased risk of cavities. Additionally, the act of vaping itself can lead to oral health issues, as the repetitive motion of inhaling and exhaling can cause irritation to the mouth and throat. Furthermore, the nicotine content in e-cigarettes can also have negative effects on oral and dental health. Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it restricts blood flow, which can lead to a decrease in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the gums and other oral tissues. This can result in a higher risk of gum disease and delayed healing after oral surgery or dental procedures. In addition, nicotine has been shown to contribute to the development of oral cancer, as well as other oral health issues such as tooth decay and tooth loss. More research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on oral and dental health, but in the meantime, it is crucial for individuals to take steps to protect their oral health and to be aware of the potential risks associated with e-cigarette use.",

      "abstract": "Son yıllarda, ağır alkol kullanımının biyolojik olarak değerlendirilmesinde önemli ilerlemeler kaydedilmiştir. Bu ilerlemeler, yeni laboratuvar testlerinin geliştirilmesini, sonuçları birden fazla ölçüm üzerinde birleştirmek için algoritmaların formüle edilmesini ve alkol kullanım bozukluğu tedavisi ve araştırmasında biyobelirteçlerin daha kapsamlı uygulamalarını içermektedir. Alkol alımı, muhtemelen dünya çapındaki en eski sosyal alışkanlıktır, birçok kültürde oldukça yaygındır ve sağlık ve sosyal sorunların küresel yüküne önemli ölçüde katkıda bulunur. Alkol kullanım bozukluğu tespitine yönelik biyobelirteçler hakkında yayınlanan çok sayıda çalışmalar bilimsel platformlarda yer almasına rağmen, halen birkaç temel soru devam etmektedir. Herşeyden önce, doz-yanıt ilişkilerinin belirtilmesi gerekir. Alkol sorunlarının taranmasında, belirli bir biyobelirteç kullanılmadan önce belirli bir “şüphe sorgulaması” olabilir. Bu şüphe sorgulaması, kişinin yetersiz bir öz bildirimi veya klinik muayenede belirsiz bulgular içerir. Biyobelirteçler, geçerlilik ve güvenilirlikle ilgili olağan psikometrik konuların çoğuna tabi olsa da, değerlendirmeleriyle ilgili hususlar farklıdır. Bunun yerine, biyobelirteçlerin değerlendirilmesindeki başlıca kriterler; ölçüt geçerliliği, kararlılık, test-tekrar tutarlılığı ve klinik yorumlamada güvenilirlik ile ilgilidir. Bu performans bilgileri, özellikle tam otomatik test prosedürlerinin geliştirildiği CDT (Carbonhydrate Deficient Transferrin) gibi yeni belirteçler için de geçerli durumdadır. Biyobelirteçlerin kullanımı ile klinik karar vermedeki çözümsel yaklaşım daha netlik kazanmaktadır. Bu nedenle biyobelirteçlerin artan bilgi değerini ölçmek ve beraberinde etkili algoritmaların araştırılması kritik öneme sahiptir. Bu makalemiz özellikle tanısal-tarama testi olarak kullanılan biyobelirteçlerle ilgili genel konuları ele almaktadır.",

Aunque se ha demostrado que las senales asociadas al tabaco juegan un papel muy importante en su mantenimiento, todavia sigue abierto el debate sobre la naturaleza apetitiva o aversiva de los estimulos  de  tabaco.  Este  estudio  investiga  la  naturaleza  de  los  estimulos de tabaco en mujeres no dependientes de la nicotina (n = 21) y en mujeres con dependencia moderada (n = 16) o alta (n = 16) de acuerdo con el test de Fagerstrom. Para ello, se registraron los cambios electrodermicos y la respuesta de parpadeo del reflejo de sobresalto mientras las participantes contemplaban imagenes eroticas, neutras, de mutilaciones y de tabaco. Como era esperable, los grupos mostraron mayores cambios electrodermicos y el patron tipico de modulacion del reflejo de sobresalto ante las imagenes desagradables y agradables, consistentemente con las estimaciones subjetivas en valencia afectiva y arousal.  Sin  embargo,  la  reactividad  psicofisiologica  ante  las  imagenes  de tabaco  difirio  en  funcion  del  nivel  de  dependencia  de  la  nicotina.  Para  el grupo no dependiente (no fumadoras), las imagenes de tabaco fueron consideradas  tan  poco  activadoras  como  las  neutras  y  mas  desagradables, provocando parpadeos de menor latencia que las imagenes neutras. No obstante, a medida que aumentaba la dependencia, la reactividad psicofisiologica  ante  las  imagenes  de  tabaco  se  parecia  cada  vez  mas  a  la provocada por las imagenes agradables. Asi, solo el grupo con alta dependencia presento inhibicion y mayor latencia del parpadeo ante las imagenes de tabaco que ante las neutras. Estos resultados son consistentes con trabajos anteriores que demuestran que las imagenes asociadas al tabaco activan el sistema motivacional apetitivo en los fumadores y, ademas, sugieren que este efecto podria estar modulado por  el  grado  de  dependencia  de  la  nicotina.",

When practising it almost daily at low intensity during 30 minutes, and mainly on a dynamic mode, blood pressure can decrease almost of the same order of magnitude as with an antihypertensive drug. In severe hypertension, blood pressure must be first controlled by drugs before starting the physical exercise training. An exercise test is preferable before exercise suggestion in sedentary people older than 40 years. In hypertensive people who enter sportive competition, diuretics and betablockers are forbidden. These agents can also reduce performance.",

      "title": "Einfluss des Rauchens auf das Riechvermögen des Menschen",
      "abstract": "Der Riechsinn des Menschen ist uber viele Jahre hinweg als weniger wichtig als z.B. das Sehen und das Horen angesehen worden. Erst in den letzten Jahren und Jahrzehnten hat das klinisch-wissenschaftliche Interesse am Riechsinn zugenommen. So konnten vielfaltigste Ursachen und Mechanismen von Riechstorungen entdeckt und zahlreiche Verfahren zur Testung des Riechsinnes etabliert werden. Die Wirkung des Rauchens auf den Riechsinn konnte allerdings trotz einiger Anstrengungen und Untersuchungen nicht abschliesend geklart werden. Vereinzelte Arbeiten stellen keinerlei schadliche Wirkung des Rauchens auf den Riechsinn fest, wahrend andere Veroffentlichungen sehr wohl negative Einflusse des Rauchens auf das Riechvermogen des Menschen beschreiben. Allerdings wird diese Schadigung von einigen Autoren als kurzfristig und reversibel, von anderen dagegen als langfristig und irreversibel interpretiert. So war es das Ziel dieser Arbeit, den zeitlichen Charakter des Einflusses des Rauchens auf das Riechvermogen junger Menschen genauer zu beleuchten. Schadigt das Rauchen das Riechvermogen, und wenn ja, ist dieser Schaden von kurzfristigem oder von langfristigem Charakter, oder lasst sich eine solch strikte Trennung moglicherweise gar nicht durchfuhren? So soll letztlich eine Aussage daruber getroffen werden, ob der Raucherstatus in der Ermittlung von Riechnormwerten Berucksichtigung finden muss. Deshalb wurden zwischen Juni 2009 und Juni 2010 in der HNO-Universitatsklinik in Jena 40 Raucher und 43 Nieraucher auf ihr Riechvermogen hin mit Hilfe der Sniffin’ Sticks Testbatterie untersucht. Alle Probanden mussten zwischen 18 und 35 Jahren alt sein und durften nicht unter Krankheiten leiden, welche das Riechvermogen beeinflussen. So wurden z.B. Nasenpolypen durch eine anteriore Rhinoskopie ausgeschlossen. Nach einer ersten Riechtestung zu Testbeginn mussten sich die Raucher einer zweistundigen Rauchkarenz unterziehen, um danach einen Riechwert zu ermitteln. Danach wurden sie aufgefordert, eine Zigarette zu rauchen, ehe im Anschluss wieder mehrfach das Riechvermogen getestet wurde. Die Nieraucher hingegen unterzogen sich als Kontrollgruppe lediglich zwei Riechtestungen. Die Daten der Riechtestungen sowie parallel erhobene Blutdruck- und Pulswerte sowie einige Angaben, die in einem Fragebogen ermittelt wurden (u.a. eine Selbsteinschatzung des Riechvermogens) wurden mit Hilfe von SPSS statistisch ausgewertet. Es zeigte sich, dass die Raucher signifikant schlechtere Riechwerte als die Nieraucher erzielten. Aber direkt nach Einhaltung der zweistundigen Rauchkarenz verbesserte sich das Riechvermogen der Raucher kurzfristig auf das Niveau der Nieraucher. Auch in allen Teiltesten der Sniffin’ Sticks Testbatterie (Riechschwellen-, Diskriminations- und Identifikationstestung) zeigten sich diese Ergebnisse. Auserdem wiesen Raucher, die mehr als 7,5 packyears hatten (n=19), insgesamt schlechtere Riechwerte auf als Raucher, die weniger als 7,5 packyears hatten (n=21). Zusatzlich zeigte sich eine signifikante negative Korrelation zwischen Riechvermogen insgesamt und packyears. Die weiblichen Probanden erzielten bessere Riechergebnisse als die mannlichen Probanden, Altersunterschiede im Riechvermogen traten nicht auf. Auch zeigte sich, dass Raucher und Nieraucher ihr eigenes Riechvermogen nur sehr ungenau einschatzten und, dass Blutdruck und Puls zwar durch das Rauchen einer Zigarette akut anstiegen, nach 30minutiger Rauchkarenz aber auch wieder absanken. Es muss also festgestellt werden, dass das Rauchen einen schadigenden Einfluss auf das Riechvermogen des Menschen ausubt. Akutes Rauchen einer Zigarette fuhrt dabei in erster Linie zu kurzfristigen und reversiblen Schaden, denn schon eine zweistundige Rauchkarenz hat eine Verbesserung des Riechvermogens auf das Niveau von Nierauchern zur Folge. Chronisches Rauchen mit einer erreichten Zigarettendosis von mehr als 7,5 packyears fuhrt zusatzlich auch zu langfristigen Schadigungen des Riechvermogens. So wurden signifikant schlechtere SDI-Werte bei einer Dosis von mehr als 7,5 packyears gemessen. Die Geschlechtszugehorigkeit ubte einen schwacheren Einfluss auf das Riechvermogen aus, als die erreichte Zigarettendosis. Bei einem Probandenalter von maximal 35 Jahren bleibt das individuelle Alter ohne Einfluss. Die Ungenauigkeit in der Selbsteinschatzung des eigenen Riechvermogens macht subjektive und objektive Testverfahren in der Ermittlung des Riechvermogens eines Menschen unverzichtbar. Insgesamt muss gefolgert werden, dass der Rauchstatus und die erreichte Zigarettendosis bei der Ermittlung von Riechnormwerten berucksichtigt werden sollten. Auserdem sollte vor jeder Messung der Riechfunktion eine Rauchkarenz von zwei Stunden eingehalten werden.",

Although dosing errors remain modest when using teaspoons, they may increase when using various sizes of larger spoons (3). If the size of a spoon leads a teaspoonful of liquid medicine to seem like markedly more or less than 5 mL (4), a person may compensate by under- or over-dosing (Figure).",

      "abstract": "Currently, drug addiction represents a phenomenon with serious medical repercussions related to the extremely important damages that it produces on our health. At the same time, the continually rising incidence and prevalence of drug consumption also make this phenomenon a serious public health problem. But, can we reduce drug addiction only to these aspects? Recent theories have made the assumption that the motivation for drug consumption can not be reduced only to the chemical properties of the drug, because there are comparative data that show that some people can become addict even from the first doses, even if they are little, whereas in the case of others the addictive behavior does not appear even in case of big doses of drug; the explanation could rely on the deep roots of this phenomenon which confers it profound social repercussions, such as social insatisfaction, socio-familial background, etc. These elements, next to the perception of society, which stigmatizes the supporters of drug consumption, marginalizes them or just disposes of them, without the possibility of any subsequent reinsertion, transform this phenomenon into a real social problem. Although drug consumption produces major damages on the physical and mental health, the voluntary demand level for specialized anti-drug treatment is extremely low compared to the number of addicts and the explanation can probably be related to this social perception which brings along the addicts’ lack of confidence in values such as confidentiality of medical information. And what if the medical personnel also have a discriminating and stigmatizing attitude in relation to this category? To what extent do drugaddicts have the same rights as the other patients and to what extent are they respected? To what extent the drug addict position itself represents a reason for discrimination in relation to the other patients? These are aspects that make drug addiction an important ethical problem.",

Current evidence indicates that marijuana use, especially early and dosedependent use, can have significant negative ramifications on general functioning, academic performance, psychiatric wellness, and may be causally related to development of other substance use disorders and risky behaviors. No strong evidence supports marijuana as a beneficial treatment for any psychiatric indication, however there is evidence supporting the use of cannabidiol (CBD) in illnesses such as epilepsy. Providers must be well apprised of the current evidence base for both detecting and treating marijuana use disorder given its increasing prevalence and decreasing perception of risk.

      "abstract": "Despite its well known harmful effects on health, tobacco use is widespread throughout the world. Approximately one third of the global population become smokers at the age of 15 years or more. The prevalence of smoking between genders is lessening. Earlier, men used to smoke three to four times more than women globally. The nicotine content of cigarette is small (10 to 12 mg) and a smoker inhales about 1.1 to 1.8 mg of nicotine from each cigarette smoked to its entire length; this plant alkaloid stimulates the central nervous system, causes either ganglionic stimulation in low doses or ganglionic blockade in high doses, and smokers can develop a moderate to heavy physical dependence. Among other numerous substances, several are cancerogenic, and about 98 percent of lung cancer deaths are caused due to tobacco smoke. Nicotine addiction is often more severe than alcohol addiction. Smoking also may complicate anesthetic management, and passive smoking increases the rate of perioperative airway complications in the children of smokers, too. Preoperative abstinence from tobacco is required for surgical patients and it offers an opportunity for smokers to quit permanently. Physicians have an important role in helping smokers to quit tobacco or e-cigarettes, but if a doctor is a smoker himself, his antismoking influence may be deficient. Since a significant percentage of medical students are smokers, it is worth influencing them to stop the habit. The best way is to introduce tobacco modules, stimulating students to participate in anti-smoking campaigns, offer non-smoking hospitals, non-smoking university campuses, non-smoking dormitories, and to provide medical assistance to student smokers who wish to quit.",

      "title": "Cigarette smoking and medical students.",
      "abstract": "Despite its well known harmful effects on health, tobacco use is widespread throughout the world. Approximately one third of the global population become smokers at the age of 15 years or more. The prevalence of smoking between genders is lessening. Earlier, men used to smoke three to four times more than women globally. The nicotine content of cigarette is small (10 to 12 mg) and a smoker inhales about 1.1 to 1.8 mg of nicotine from each cigarette smoked to its entire length; this plant alkaloid stimulates the central nervous system, causes either ganglionic stimulation in low doses or ganglionic blockade in high doses, and smokers can develop a moderate to heavy physical dependence. Among other numerous substances, several are cancerogenic, and about 98 percent of lung cancer deaths are caused due to tobacco smoke. Nicotine addiction is often more severe than alcohol addiction. Smoking also may complicate anesthetic management, and passive smoking increases the rate of perioperative airway complications in the children of smokers, too. Preoperative abstinence from tobacco is required for surgical patients and it offers an opportunity for smokers to quit permanently. Physicians have an important role in helping smokers to quit tobacco or e-cigarettes, but if a doctor is a smoker himself, his antismoking influence may be deficient. Since a significant percentage of medical students are smokers, it is worth influencing them to stop the habit. The best way is to introduce tobacco modules, stimulating students to participate in anti-smoking campaigns, offer non-smoking hospitals, non-smoking university campuses, non-smoking dormitories, and to provide medical assistance to student smokers who wish to quit.",

      "title": "Tobacco Control for Clinicians Who Treat Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Smoking remains the most common preventable cause of death in the developed world, and is rapidly becoming an important cause of death in the developing world. Nicotine is a powerfully addictive substance, and the tobacco industry spends billions annually promoting it in the United States. It is therefore important for clinicians to understand why people smoke, to address smoking in patients of all ages, and to lobby for health-preserving tobacco control policies at the community level. Children take up smoking in response to social influences: smoking by friends, parents, and family, and through exposure to smoking in media. Parents who smoke not only model the behavior, but also often make the product available by leaving cigarettes around the house. Media influences include the dollar 10 billion spent per year on tobacco marketing, but more importantly, the modeling of the behavior on screen by movie and television stars. Once children start smoking, many rapidly lose autonomy over the behavior. Youth can get hooked after smoking just a few cigarettes. The most effective community efforts for reducing tobacco use are: raising the price of tobacco; halting the sale of tobacco to minors; enforcing strict school tobacco policies; and making public places smoke free through local ordinances. Working with individuals, clinicians should support cessation in all smokers, including parents of children and adolescents. They should screen children for smoking risk factors beginning at age 10. They should teach parents to maintain smoke-free households, to set nonsmoking expectations early on, and to monitor adolescents for signs of smoking. Parents should limit exposure to adult media (e.g., R-rated movies) and use family television time to discuss the effect of seeing screen depictions of smoking on adolescent behavior. Adolescents who smoke should be assessed for signs of nicotine dependence and counseled about quitting. Clinicians are effective community voices; they should participate in efforts to raise tobacco taxes, limit the display of tobacco advertising, and make public places smoke free because of the adverse health effects of passive exposure to cigarette smoke.",

      "title": "Therapeutic vaccines for nicotine dependence.",
      "abstract": "Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Despite the development of a number of drugs for smoking cessation, overall efficacy of these substances is limited and the majority of smokers fail to quit smoking long-term. These drugs aim to help people quit by either replacing nicotine with an alternative source of nicotine (eg, patches or gums) or by reducing the withdrawal symptoms. A vaccine against nicotine has a different strategy: by inducing sufficient nicotine-specific antibodies, it is possible to sequester the drug in the blood and prevent it from entering the brain. In this way, the addictive properties of cigarettes are eliminated and smokers attempting to quit may be able to smoke one or two cigarettes without becoming hooked again. Essentially, a vaccine against nicotine targets the progression from lapses to full relapse rather than withdrawal symptoms. Recent research with vaccines against nicotine has clearly demonstrated in animals that antibodies can interfere with the addictive properties of nicotine in different settings. The first phase II clinical trial has confirmed the validity of the concept and shown that a vaccine against nicotine can be efficacious for smoking cessation in humans provided anti-nicotine antibody levels are sufficiently high.",

      "abstract": "Whilst energy drinks improve performance and feelings of alertness, recent articles suggest that energy drink consumption combined with alcohol may reduce perception of alcohol intoxication, or lead to increased alcohol or drug use. This review discusses the available scientific evidence on the effects of mixing energy drinks with alcohol.A literature search was performed using the keywords \"energy drink and Red Bull(®)\" and consulting Medline/Pubmed, PsycINFO, and Embase.There is little evidence that energy drinks antagonize the behavioral effects of alcohol, and there is no consistent evidence that energy drinks alter the perceived level of intoxication of people who mix energy drinks with alcohol. No clinically relevant cardiovascular or other adverse effects have been reported for healthy subjects combining energy drinks with alcohol, although there are no long-term investigations currently available. Finally, whilst several surveys have shown associations, there is no direct evidence that coadministration of energy drinks increases alcohol consumption, or initiates drug and alcohol dependence or abuse.Although some reports suggest that energy drinks lead to reduced awareness of intoxication and increased alcohol consumption, a review of the available literature shows that these views are not supported by direct or reliable scientific evidence. A personality with higher levels of risk-taking behavior may be the primary reason for increased alcohol and drug abuse per se. The coconsumption of energy drinks being one of the many expressions of that type of lifestyle and personality.",

Recientemente se han introducido los sistemas electronicos de administracion de nicotina, comunmente conocidos como cigarrillos electronicos. Este trabajo tiene como objetivos describir y exponer la composicion de los cigarrillos electronicos, efecto sobre la salud y necesidad del conocimiento de este dispositivo en la practica medica comunitaria. Desarrollo El cigarrillo electronico es un dispositivo con forma de cigarrillo convencional, consta de boquilla, bateria, camara de vaporizacion, el cartucho de la solucion, que es el que contiene el liquido que se convierte en aerosol, formando particulas finas y ultrafinas en fase gaseosa. Libera determinadas dosis de vapores de nicotina y otras sustancias a traves de un proceso de calentamiento electronico. Los cartuchos tienen mucha variabilidad en la cantidad de nicotina liberada, contiene otras sustancias como el propilenglicol, glicerina vegetal, propanodion, altas concentraciones de particulas PM 2.5, carcinogenos como los hidrocarburos aromaticos y aluminio, entre otros productos irritantes de las vias respiratorias. Conclusiones Actualmente se debate en cuanto a la seguridad y efectos sobre la salud, tanto del usuario como de los que estan expuestos a ese vapor. Su potencial de adiccion, puede constituir la antesala para pasar al uso del cigarrillo convencional. Puede tener un efecto indeseable al estimular el consumo en adolescentes o retener a fumadores adultos en el consumo de nicotina y reforzar la dependencia.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that light to moderate amounts of polyphenol-rich alcoholic beverages like wine or beer could have health benefits. Scientists have long debated the effects of alcohol on immune function, showing on the one hand, that high doses of alcohol consumption can directly suppress a wide range of immune responses, and that alcohol abuse is associated with an increased incidence of a number of infectious diseases. On the other hand, moderate alcohol consumption seems to have a beneficial impact on the immune system compared to alcohol abuse or abstinence. Therefore, the link between alcohol consumption, immune response, as well as infectious and inflammatory processes remains not completely understood. With this in mind, it is important to realise that other factors, unrelated or indirectly related to immune function, like drinking patterns, beverage type, amount of alcohol, or gender differences, will affect the influence that alcohol consumption may have on the immune system. This review summarises published data describing the effects that light to moderate amounts of polyphenol-rich beverages like wine or beer seem to have on immunity in healthy adults.",

The ultimate aim has been to persuade people to stop smoking. It is generally recognized that smoking cessation is effective in reducing the burden of disease associated with smoking. However, smoking is an addiction to nicotine and relatively few people can quit successfully without professional help. Many do not want even to try. There is evidence that a reduction in cigarette consumption could result in improved health and provide an intermediate step before complete cessation, especially for those smokers who are not ready or willing to quit. Smoking reduction intervention with counselling and/or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) have been shown by randomised controlled trials to be effective in reducing cigarette consumption for the general smoking population. We here present the argument that there may be a case for promoting smoking reduction both as a desirable goal in itself and as a first step towards smoking cessation.",

The most effective weight loss intervention is one that includes a moderately reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and the use of behavior strategies to facilitate adherence. The goal should be a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% that can be maintained long term. Although individual studies have identified specific benefits associated with certain diets, no diet has been shown to be more effective than another. For substantial health benefits, adults should engage in at least 150 to 300 min/week of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Effective behavior strategies include the combination of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy. Other strategies include removal of environmental trigger foods, self distraction to help with cravings and boredom eating, and planning ahead. It is critical that children and adolescents avoid dieting or other consciously restrictive behaviors because these have been associated with weight gain and binge eating. Rather than weight, discussions with children and adolescents should focus on achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Physical activity should be encouraged from childhood through young adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Quitting smoking is the single most important step a smoker can take to improve the length and quality of his or her life (www.lung.org). However, stopping smoking can be tough due to the addic-tive nature of nicotine. Thus, governments need to encourage smokers to quit and provide assis-tance to those who need help by formulating smoker-friendly policies. However, tobacco con-trol efforts in developing countries such as India have mostly concentrated on advertising bans, package labeling, prohibition of smoking at public places and raising taxes. Such policies encourage the social norm of non-smoking and increase the demand for cessation services. However, poor cessation services will lead to more relapses and failed quit attempts. Several evidence based strate-gies like behavioral therapies, group and individual counseling, quitlines, pharmacotherapy (all forms of NRT, Bupropion, Varenicline), quit and win, text messaging have been repeatedly shown to in-crease quit rates significantly. Despite strong evi-dence based strategies, smoking cessation is not necessarily approached as a key tobacco-control strategy.",

The current trends of tobacco use in India includes 1 million deaths per year, and the problem is worsening, and also, tobacco use will cause 13% of deaths in India by 2022. To control this number, it is an alarming situation to work on the main etiology. Smoking cessation programs are considered very useful in helping tobacco users to quit, as it is a very difficult addiction to break and effective approaches are required. So, authors reported a case of 61-year-old male patient who was a chronic smoker and used to smoke 20-25 cigarettes per day. He started noticing the ill effects of tobacco in the body, so he finally decided to seek help from doctor. His habit reduced to half in few days, and finally he completely quitted smoking with the help of behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "It is not uncommon for parents to give their adolescent children sips of alcohol, despite it being well known that adolescent alcohol overindulgence is associated with major long-term harms. A prospective Australian study surveyed 1729 12–13-year-old schoolchildren and their parents (Time 1) and followed them up 1 year later (Time 2).1 The aim was to investigate associations between familial, parental, peer and adolescent characteristics at Time 1 and parental supply of alcohol at Time 2. The study found that 24.4% of parents supplied alcohol to their 13–14-year-old children at Time 2, usually on holidays or special occasions, family dinners and parties. Not surprisingly, parents who drank and had lax rules around alcohol were more likely to provide alcohol to adolescents. Less predictably, parents who perceived that their child engaged with substance-using peers were more likely to provide sips of alcohol, perhaps believing this might protect their child against unsupervised alcohol use with their friends. What is not yet known is the link between having or not having sips of alcohol in adolescence and later alcohol abuse.",

      "abstract": "Because their multiple reserves are typically lower, older people are more sensitive to the toxic effects of environmental agents. The liver’s ability to detoxify chemicals declines with age, as well as the ability of the kidney to excrete toxins. Everyone, especially the aged, should limit exposure to environmental toxins, including air pollution, solvents, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, and other dangers. Exposure to toxins early in life may lower a person’s physical reserve and result in cognitive impairment with aging. Exposure to pesticides and other toxins has been linked to Parkinson’s. Air pollution is also a risk factor for dementia. Considerable evidence shows that smoking increases the risk of cognitive impairment, stroke, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and cancer. Excessive alcohol intake can damage several parts of the body and our physical reserve. It can also impair our cognitive reserve through impaired memory and learning. People over age 60 shouldn’t drink more than two doses of alcohol per day for men and one for women. Alcohol abuse can lead to depression and poor psychological reserve with loss of friends causing impaired social reserve. Excess use of alcohol can also contribute to falls, car accidents, liver damage seizures, and stroke.",

Recent scientific research provides overwhelming evidence that not only do drugs interfere with normal brain functioning creating powerful feelings of pleasure, but they also have long-term effects on brain metabolism and activity. At some point, changes occur in the brain that can turn drug abuse into addiction, chronic, relapsing illness. Those addicted to drugs suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and cannot quit by themselves. Treatment is necessary to end this compulsive behaviour. This book includes within its scope leading-edge research on cocaine and heroin abuse.",

      "title": "Maintenance of long-term weight loss.",
      "abstract": "J. Graham Thomas, MS, and Rena R. Wing, PhD A key problem in the area of weight control is the maintenance of weight loss. Behavioral treatment programs are able to consistently produce weight losses of 7 – 10% of initial body weight at the end of 6 – 12 months of treatment. However, even with ongoing contact, clients often regain the weight, a finding documented by the Diabetes Prevention Program. 1 What makes weight loss maintenance so difficult? Physiological changes which occur during weight loss can promote weight regain; e.g., decreases in metabolic rate, increases in catecholamine excretion and thyroid function, increase in ghrelin, and increases in lipoprotein lipase activity. Psychological and behavior changes are also related to weight regain. People may become bored on restricted diets and more responsive to palatable foods and social cues that pressure them to eat more and exercise less. Finally, dieters’ motivation may decrease after an initial weight loss; clothes fit better, health may have improved, and the psychological effort or “costs” of adhering to a weight loss regimen may come to outweigh the benefits. Two approaches have been used to better understand the behavioral factors associated with weight loss maintenance and regain. One approach is to study those who have been successful at longterm weight loss maintenance. The other approach is to conduct randomized trials evaluating specific approaches to improve long-term weight loss. Both of these approaches are discussed below.",

Half of the hospitalized subjects had a history of an inordinate use of alcohol; this excessive use predominated during the manic phase, a fact that does not support the popular view that alcohol is used to counteract depression. Patients themselves frequently reported a deliberale use of alcohol to decrease manic symptoms and a tendency to shun alcohol during the depressive phase. Alcohol did not seem to alter the presenting symptoms of hospitalized manic patients, since irritability and the loss of impulse control were similar among the drinkers and nondrinkers.",

It is a psychoactive substance that affects the brain and central nervous system. When nicotine is consumed through smoking, vaping, or other methods, it quickly reaches the brain, leading to a release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, which causes feelings of pleasure and relaxation. However, nicotine is highly addictive, and its use can lead to physical and psychological dependence. Due to its addictive nature, nicotine is often the primary reason people find it challenging to quit smoking or using tobacco products. It's essential to be aware of the potential health risks associated with nicotine use, particularly through smoking, which is linked to various diseases like lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. While some people use nicotine replacement therapies (like patches, gum, or lozenges) to help quit smoking, it's essential to seek professional advice and support when trying to break the addiction.",

Caffeine is pervasive in our beverages, foods, and medicines. Americans may find it difficult, even impossible, to completely eliminate from their diets. Caffeine is a natural ingredient in coffees, chocolates, and teas. It is intentionally added to products ranging from sodas, sports drinks, performance dietary supplements, alcoholic beverages, headache medicines, and even drinking water. Routine, extensive ingestion of America's favorite drug reflects our societal acquiescence in addiction. A caffeine high is an innocent pleasure that millions undertake one or more times each day to stimulate their minds and bodies to perform at peak levels. Caffeine provides a daily, inexpensive boost of energy that makes life better for many Americans, regardless of their social class, ethnicity, or status.",

      "abstract": "Since the beginnings of twenty-first century in Poland increasing number of reports about the drug-facilitated sexual assaults have been observed. Many drugs have been identified as so-called \"date-rape drugs\", because of their pharmacological properties, especially inducing amnesia. These drugs are used for the purpose of \"drugging\" unsuspected victims and than raping them. In a typical scenario, the perpetrator surreptitiously adds \"date-rape drug\" to the alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person, who is subsequently sexually assaulted while under the influence of this substance. Many victims do not report the incident until several days after the event or even do not report it at all. They report the incident so late after the events because they often have problems with remember the course of incident. It causes that victim is not reliable witness for justice. Detection of \"date-rape drugs\" in biological fluids is unequivocal evidence of perpetration. Analysis of biological fluids collected from victims of rapes for presence of drugs was rare in Poland up to now. The aim of this study is to show the use of \"date-rape drugs\" in Poland. Materials for this study were from the routine casework elaborated at the Institute of Forensic Research in Kraków. APCI-LC-MS methods were applied for screening of biological fluids (blood and/or urine) for amphetamine and its 6 analogues, for 12 substances from benzodiazepine group and for quantification of the detected drugs. HPLC-DAD was used as a screening method for wide range of medicinal drugs, and NCI-GC-MS methods for determination of ketamine and tetrahydrocannabinols (delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, 9THC) and its metabolite (11-nor-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THCCOOH). In 2000-2004, the biological fluids taken from 33 persons, both sexually assaulted or perpetrators were analysed. In 2000 and 2002 not any case of this type was registered, in 2001 only two cases were recorded. After 2003 significant increase in the number of these cases was observed. Eleven and twenty cases involving \"date-rape drugs\" were submitted to the Institute in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The most common substances detected in analysed materials were amphetamine (in concentrations ranged from 10 to 85 ng/ml) and 9THC (0.36-1.4 ng/ml). Alcohol (0.27-2.3% per hundred), MDMA (8-201 ng/ml), benzodiazepines (oxazepam, nordazepam, estazolam), propranolol and lidocaine were also found in blood and urine specimens.",

On the other hand, based on a lowered caloric intake and/or a one-sided diet, the possibility of the occurrence of deficiencies will be greater. Resorption disturbances, less body activity, misuse of laxantia and other factors may also be of a negative effect. Quite a number of publications point to the possibility of latent deficiencies, as shown by lowered vitamin and mineral blood levels. Although the available data are scare, older people are certainly a very vulnerable group, in need of special care with regard to their diet, quantitatively as well as qualitatively.",

      "abstract": "Substance addiction is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a recurrent desire to continue taking a psychoactive substance despite the harmful consequences. Alcohol is the most commonly used psychoactive substance and one of the most significant criminogenic factors, especially when committing violent crimes. The crimes committed by alcohol addicts are most often related to acute alcohol intoxication, which occurs in approximately half of violent crimes as well as in half of sexual crimes. The role of alcohol is important in violence between intimate partners and road accidents, but also in non-violent crimes. Alcohol dependence is more prevalent in prison population than in general population. Drug addicts commit disproportionately more crimes than the general population. Although most crimes are acquisitive, some research has shown that drug addicts commit several other types of crimes, including violent ones. Heroin, crack and cocaine are most often associated with crime, while people who use cannabis are the least prone to crime. Although there are more men among drug addicts, but also perpetrators of crime, women drug addicts are much more often involved in criminal activities than women who do not use drugs. Gambling addiction is a behavioral addiction that activates a reward system similar to drug abuse and has some behavioral symptoms that can be compared to substance addiction. Gambling addicts most\r\noften commit non-violent crimes for financial gain, but compared to the general population, they also commit more violent crimes and crimes related to drugs. In order to reduce the number of crimes committed by addicts, addiction needs to be adequately treated. The sourt may also impose a security measure of addiction treatment on an addicted perpetrator of a\r\ncriminal offense. Treatment must be individualized. Psychiatric comorbidities that are much more common in addicts, and especially in addicts who commit crimes, than in the general population should be also considered when treating an addict. It is important to prevent addictions through school programs, legal regulations, and media campaigns.",

A smaller number increase excess neuronal serotonin levels by blocking serotonin reuptake or by increasing its release. All these drugs produce significantly greater weight loss than does placebo in most studies. Abuse is a problem with amphetamine, methamphetamine, and benzphetamine, whereas other drugs have minimal or no potential for abuse. Weight loss can be sustained for up to 36 months. Net weight loss, compared with placebo, ranges from 2 to 10 kg, and weight regain after terminating drug treatment proves that drugs do not work when not taken. The stigma of obesity, the public opprobrium toward obese persons, and regulatory rigidity have led to unjustified distrust in the potential of drug treatment for obesity.",

      "abstract": "Smak og lukt er sanser som reagerer på oppløste kjemiske stoffer fra mat og luft via hjernenervene. Fysiologiske aldringsprosesser innebærer cellulære og intercellulære endringer i de nevroner i sentralnervesystemet som mottar smak- og luktsignalene. Aldring medfører også en viss reduksjon i antall smaksløker i munnhulen og antall luktreseptorer i nesehulen. Kliniske undersøkelser viser at svikt i smak og lukt forekommer i økende grad med stigende alder, særlig hyppig etter 80-årsalderen, og lukt hyppigere enn smak. Aldringsavhengig tap av smak og lukt er vanskelig å skille fra effekter av sykdommer og medikamentbruk, noe som er særlig karakteristisk for eldre på institusjon. Den tydeligste effekten på smakssansen rammer surt, salt og umami. Eldre er ofte ikke selv oppmerksom på dette og risikerer derfor tap av appetitt og feilernæring, særlig i retning av øket bruk av salt. Svikt i luktesansen bidrar til smakstap og kan også medføre personlige og sosiale implikasjoner i form av substandard hygiene og dårlig inneluft. I tillegg er de nevrodegenerative prosessene som fører til svekket luktesans, en av del patologien ved utvikling av demens. Svikt i luktesansen kan derfor være et forvarsel om kognitiv svikt.",

The necklace first appeared after three to eight years of drinking 77 grams of ethanol (five to six drinks) per day, seems to be permanent and to appear before other skin changes associated with alcohol abuse such as `gooseflesh', palmar erythema, and spider nevi. Recognition of the necklace indicates the need for further assessment, to determine if alcohol abuse is contributing significantly to any other symptoms or signs (e.g., hypertension, intellectual impairment, or gastrointestinal disease). If the patient is taught to recognize the necklace, he or she may be able to differentiate `social drinking' from `alcohol abuse', and be motivated to seek treatment early.",

However, tobacco smoking as a variant has been studied with relatively few clinically essential drugs and these studies do not always demonstrate a consistent effect of smoking. This review therefore not only records what data have emerged from pharmacokinetic or other studies, but it also attempts to determine whether such interactions have clinical significance. The main finding of this review is that, in the majority of examples, there is little evidence that there is a recognizable hazard from the interaction per se. The exceptions to this general conclusion are limited to four drugs: insulin, propoxyphene, propranolol, and theophylline preparations. With these drugs, there is some evidence of clinical importance of an interaction with tobacco smoking.",

Whatever complications ensue, their management and the ultimate prognosis is adversely affected by the poor general state of health of many of those who are severely dependent on drugs, resulting from poor social conditions, malnutrition and self-neglect.",

This finding is important because the ability to control tempting impulses significantly impacts the health and well-being of people at all ages. Our findings complement theory by providing rigorous empirical evidence that simple lifestyle changes may have significant personal well-being benefits. In particular, small acts of self-control, such as resisting drinking or always waking at the same time, can increase one’s overall ability to resist selfish temptations.",

Even after knowing that this dangerous addiction is a life-threatening deal, still, ironically, the prevalence of smoking is more or less not getting reduced to a desirable extent. Those who smoke are becoming miserable because of their habit of smoking. Still, on the other hand, due to passive smoking, many more innocent lives are also adversely affected for no fault. This aspect of smoking, i.e., passive or second-hand smoking, is a fearful complication of smoking which is seldom seen with other modes of addiction. Time and again, numerous researches have highlighted the adverse effects of smoking on the human body and the interference it does bring in one's life. Smoking contributes to the deterioration of many preexisting ailments and depletes many valuable aspects of the human body. Smoking thus has a devastating effect on almost all of the tissues of our body and thus exerts its effect on nearly all the major organs. This review article is made by analysing various findings from many researches conducted across the globe by having a thorough search of Pubmed database, which in turn is the main methodology of the article. This review article aims to provide a simple and subtle understanding of the ill effects of smoking on the human body by serving the readers with a readymade platter of comprehensive knowledge about smoking coupled with efforts to eliminate the associated myths.",

Objetivo: Avaliar os efeitos cardiovasculares associados ao uso de cigarros eletrônicos. Metodologia: Revisão integrativa feita a partir de buscas na literatura nas bases de dados “PubMed” e “Scielo”. 12 trabalhos foram incluídos a partir de uma avaliação criteriosa relacionada ao tema proposto. Resultados: O uso dos cigarros eletrônicos e dos convencionais contendo nicotina provocam o aumento da pressão arterial média dos pacientes e da frequência cardíaca, além de promoverem maior efeito trombótico, maior atividade plaquetária e disfunção endotelial. O uso de cigarros eletrônicos sem nicotina mostraram-se menos danosos no que tange o aumento isolado da pressão arterial, porém os estudos não demonstraram ausência de complicações possíveis, como piora da função pulmonar. Discussão: A comparação entre o uso de cigarros eletrônicos e convencionais mostrou que a nicotina é a provável substância com maior potencial danoso no sistema cardiovascular, sendo que sua presença em ambas as modalidades de consumo (tradicional e eletrônico) representaram piora dos parâmetros analisados (pressão arterial, frequência cardíaca e disfunção endotelial). Apesar de algum benefício no auxílio à cessação do tabagismo com o uso dos cigarros eletrônicos com baixo teor ou sem nicotina , mais estudos são necessários para avaliar o perfil de segurança dos cigarros eletrônicos sem nicotina. Conclusão: Os cigarros eletrônicos contendo nicotina apresentam dano semelhante aos cigarros convencionais, como aumento da pressão arterial, frequência cardíaca e disfunção endotelial.",

Many psychosocial treatments are probably equally effective. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective.

The pressure on psychical performance while studying and at work is becoming that hard that many individuals are reaching for stimulants.

This phenomenon is called brain doping or prettier cognitive enhancement.",

De acuerdo con el informe mundial sobre el consumo de drogas de la ONU de 2004, se estima que en el mundo cerca de 2.600 millones de personas lo consumen ya sea en forma ocasional, habitual, abusiva o adictiva. En Colombia, el programa presidencial RUMBOS estimo en 2001, que el 89.7% de los estudiantes universitarios eran consumidores habituales de alcohol etilico. Esta sustancia tambien es la mas utilizada en Colombia como sustancia de inicio para el consumo habitual de otras sustancias psicoactivas. El etanol cuando se consume en forma continuada y frecuente produce efectos adversos agudos y cronicos en la salud humana. En consumidores cronicos de alcohol, se han comprobado efectos adversos nutricionales, neurolo­gicos, hepaticos y teratogenicos. En intoxicacion aguda se pueden presentar alteraciones en el sistema nervioso central, gastroin­testinal, endocrino y en el equilibrio acido basico especialmente. El consumo de etanol tambien se ha asociado con la presentacion de varias alteraciones sociales como incremento en los indices de violencia intrafamiliar, violencia general, actos delictivos y accidentes de transito. Sus altos indices de consumo, su comprobado efecto toxico sobre la salud, sus repercusiones negativas sobre los roles sociales del individuo, unidos al hecho de ser una sustancia legal y socialmente aceptada, senalan el consumo incontrolado de bebidas alcoholicas como un verdadero problema de salud publica, sobre el cual es necesario llamar la atencion.",

      "abstract": "Smoking has been viewed in divergent ways throughout history. While for some cultures it has been considered a crime, for others it has been invested with magical powers and even medicinal potential. In our century, society has come to realize the health risks associated with smoking. This has led to controversies between government and the tobacco industry as well as between physician and patient. In spite of their knowledge of its deadly consequences, many individuals are unable to stop smoking. The tenacity of this habit can be explained in terms of the various psychological motivations for smoking in combination with the physiologic addiction to nicotine. While some people are able to stop the habit, many relapse in spite of a variety of quitting methods. These range from the doctor's advice to stop, education programs, group and individual psychotherapies, behavioral techniques, hypnosis, and the use of nicotine gum. With a growing understanding of what distinguishes categories of smokers and with a new appreciation for the role of nicotine in addiction to smoking, more effective antismoking strategies can be fashioned to meet the specific needs of the potential quitter.",

Despite an increased awareness of the addictive nature of smoking and availability of effective treatments, smoking continues to be widespread among individuals with psychiatric disorders. Moreover, mental health professionals remain reluctant to address smoking among their patients for a variety of reasons. Recent research has provided a wealth of data that have shaped the concept of tobacco smoking as a chronic addictive disorder and also demonstrated the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions. This paper reviews the important factors that contribute to smoking and the various pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for smoking cessation from a biopsychosocial perspective. It also makes recommendations for the rational use of these interventions to treat nicotine dependence in individuals with psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Electronic cigarettes, vaping-related lung injury and lung cancer: where do we stand?",
      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes have been considered a promising alternative to nicotine replacement products to help heavy tobacco smokers quit smoking. They work thanks to a heating coil causing evaporation of the liquid rapidly followed by cooling, thus creating an aerosol, a completely different mechanism from the combustion of tobacco in traditional cigarettes. The term 'vaping' indicates the use of electronic cigarettes or other devices to inhale heated, aerosolized nicotine, or other substances like cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol, or butane hash oils together with solvents, mainly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine or their combination. A very fast increase of vaping among adolescents has been observed since electronic cigarettes and other vaping devices first appeared. Although electronic cigarettes have been advocated as a short-term cessation aid for tobacco smokers or as a long-term alternative, there is the concrete risk that they can be perceived by young nonsmokers as a less dangerous alternative to tobacco smoking, thus stimulating nonsmokers to start smoking rather than helping heavy tobacco smokers to quit smoking. Moreover, several cases of exogenous lipoid pneumonia and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with proven alveolar injury, as well as vaping-associated bronchiolitis obliterans, have been recently reported among electronic cigarette smokers, with severe clinical impact, thus posing the risk of the life-threatening toxic potential of vaping. At the moment, no definitive assessment can be made about the efficacy of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, and further studies are required about vaping-related life-threatening acute lung injury.",

Studier, hvor forfatterne ikke har en interessekonflikt, indikerer/finder næsten altid helbredsskade. Der er fundet mange negative orale effekter ved brug af e-cigaretter. Tandlæger har en vigtig rolle i at identificere e-cigaretbrug og være opmærksomme på e-cigaretters skadelige virkninger. Rygere, der ønsker en oral sundhed, skal holde helt op med at ryge, ikke skifte til e-cigaretter. Evidensen peger desuden på helbredsskade på blandt andet lungerne og hjertekarsystemet. Stigende brug af e-cigaretter hos børn og unge (i nogle lande) er bekymrende, og der er sufficient evidens til at konkludere, at e-cigaretbrug øger risikoen for, at de begynder at ryge almindelige cigaretter. Ingen e-cigaretter er godkendt som rygestopmidler, og befolkningsbaserede studier indikerer, at de kan have modsat effekt, dvs. underminere rygestop.

      "abstract": "The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) is increasing rapidly, but their effects on lung toxicity are largely unknown. Smoking is a well-established cause of lung cancer and respiratory disease, in part through inflammation. It is plausible that e-cig use might affect similar inflammatory pathways. E-cigs are used by some smokers as an aid for quitting or smoking reduction, and by never smokers (e.g., adolescents and young adults). The relative effects for impacting disease risk may differ for these groups. Cell culture and experimental animal data indicate that e-cigs have the potential for inducing inflammation, albeit much less than smoking. Human studies show that e-cig use in smokers is associated with substantial reductions in blood or urinary biomarkers of tobacco toxicants when completely switching and somewhat for dual use. However, the extent to which these biomarkers are surrogates for potential lung toxicity remains unclear. The FDA now has regulatory authority over e-cigs and can regulate product and e-liquid design features, such as nicotine content and delivery, voltage, e-liquid formulations, and flavors. All of these factors may impact pulmonary toxicity. This review summarizes current data on pulmonary inflammation related to both smoking and e-cig use, with a focus on human lung biomarkers.

It has both positive and negative effects on the human body, and its activity concerns a variety of systems including the central nervous system, immune system, digestive system, respiratory system, urinary tract, etc. These effects are dependent on quantity, the type of product in which caffeine is contained, and also on the individual differences among people (sex, age, diet etc.). The main aim of this review was to collect, present, and analyze the available information including the latest discoveries on the impact of caffeine on human health and the functioning of human body systems, taking into account the role of caffeine in individual disease entities. We present both the positive and negative sides of caffeine consumption and the healing properties of this purine alkaloid in diseases such as asthma, Parkinson's disease, and others, not forgetting about the negative effects of excess caffeine (e.g., in people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly). In summary, we can conclude, however, that caffeine has a multi-directional influence on various organs of the human body, and because of its anti-oxidative properties, it was, and still is, an interesting topic for research studies including those aimed at developing new therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Mensen met astma en COPD gaan niet anders om met hun ziekte dan een paar jaar geleden. Wel is er meer begrip voor astma en COPD. Opmerkelijk is dat er geen samenhang is in (gezonde) leefstijl. Voldoende bewegen hangt niet samen met niet-roken of juist medicijngebruik en andersom.\n\nMensen met astma of COPD (Chronisch obstructieve longaandoening) kunnen veel zelf doen om de klachten te verminderen of verergering te voorkomen. Dit zogenoemde ‘zelfmanagement’ is belangrijk in de behandeling. Patienten leren zo goed mogelijk met de ziekte om te gaan, zodat zij – ondanks de ziekte – zoveel mogelijk naar tevredenheid hun eigen leven kunnen leiden. Een allereerste aanzet voor zelfmanagement is dat mensen met astma en COPD gezond leven. Voldoende bewegen, niet roken en ook juist medicijngebruik helpen daarbij. \n\nGedragsverandering\nHet medicijngebruik van mensen met astma en COPD is sinds 2002 ongeveer gelijk gebleven en ook de mate waarin ze bewegen is onveranderd. Het aantal mensen met astma en COPD dat rookt is de laatste jaren min of meer stabiel. Mensen met astma roken zelden (14%) en mensen met COPD iets vaker (21%), maar nog altijd minder dan de gemiddelde Nederlander (27% in 2008), zo blijkt uit onderzoek van het NIVEL (Nederlands instituut voor onderzoek van de gezondheidszorg) dat is uitgevoerd met subsidie van het Astma Fonds. NIVEL-onderzoeker Daphne Jansen: “Gedragsverandering is niet eenvoudig. Met alleen adviezen lukt het niet. Er is volgens mensen met astma en COPD wel meer begrip in de omgeving. Partner en familie weten beter wat het betekent om de ziekte te hebben.”\n\nRoken of bewegen\nOpvallend is dat het ene ‘gezonde gedrag’ – niet roken – niet samenhangt met het andere, bijvoorbeeld meer bewegen. “Er spelen andere factoren”, verklaart Daphne Jansen. “Opleiding en leeftijd spelen een rol en bij roken speelt daarnaast mee of mensen het gevoel hebben dat hun omgeving rekening met ze houdt. Bij medicijngebruik gaat het vooral om de opvattingen van de patient over de noodzaak van de medicatie en bezorgdheid over de medicatie, bijvoorbeeld over bijwerkingen. Bovendien verschillen mensen in hun voorkeur voor type ondersteuning voor een gezonde leefstijl. Voor een gezonde leefstijl is zelfvertrouwen, goede informatie van behandelaars, ondersteuning van mensen uit de omgeving en schone lucht nodig. Het helpt allemaal.” \n\nMethode\nDe onderzoekers zochten naar veranderingen in 2009 in (gezonde) leefstijl van mensen met astma of COPD ten opzichte van voorgaande jaren. Ze keken naar roken, bewegen en medicijngebruik. Daarbij zochten ze naar een samenhang tussen de leefstijl en persoonlijke kenmerken, de ernst van de luchtwegaandoening, persoonlijke opvattingen over astma of COPD, gevoelens van zelfcontrole en omgevingsinvloeden. Aan het onderzoek – met vragenlijsten – werkten 610 mensen met astma en 338 mensen met COPD mee uit het Nationaal Panel Chronisch zieken en Gehandicapten van het NIVEL.",

      "abstract": "Energy drinks contain several ingredients with primarily stimulating effects. Consumption of these drinks greatly increased in the last several years, especially among young people. Recently, scientists focused on investigating their safety. Apart from its desirable effects like boosted mental and physical performance, studies show that energy drinks can also cause adverse effects, which currently remain not well described. The purpose of this article was to present current trends in energy drink consumption among young adults and to describe the mechanisms of adverse effects, which might be caused by it. The ingredients of energy drinks, like caffeine, consumed in high doses ( > 200 mg/day), were shown to cause shaking, dizziness, heart palpitations, and sleep disorders. The excessive consumption of energy drinks can also lead to electrolyte imbalance, and heart-related diseases, e.g. myocardial infarction. It is essential to familiarise oneself with the composition of the energy drinks and follow the recommendations for maximum daily intake of substances contained in these drinks. In addition, it is necessary to raise awareness of pharmacological mechanisms of possible side effects and to further the research on the consumption of energy drinks, especially among young people.",

Use of electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes), devices that deliver a nicotine containing vapor has increased rapidly across the world. They are marketed as a \"healthier alternatives\" to conventional cigarettes. There is extensive debate over long-term safety and efficacy of these devices on public health. Studies show that the vapor generated from the E-cigarettes has a variable amount of nicotine and potential harmful toxins. Until robust research demonstrates the safety of E-cigarettes and efficacy in the treatment of tobacco dependence, their role as safe smoking cessation tool is unclear. This review highlights the recent data regarding E-cigarettes toxicity, impact on lung function, and efficacy in smoking reduction and cessation.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews the effects of alcohol on human psychomotor performance and cognitive function. It concentrates particularly on effects on reaction time and on skills related to car driving. The effects of alcohol on performance are very variable at low doses (under 1 g per kg body weight). The variability is due to the different measures and methods employed by the researchers and to the large interindividual and interoccasional differences in the effects of alcohol. That is, alcohol affects different people in different ways and it affects the same person differently on separate occasions. Greater performance deficits are observed as the dose increases and as the tasks become more complex. Although results vary, both nicotine and caffeine appear to antagonize the detrimental effects of alcohol on performance. Many other drugs interact with alcohol, the most important of which are sedative agents that can combine synergistically with alcohol to produce profound psychomotor and cognitive impairment. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Asimismo, muchos adultos fumadores de cigarrillos de tabaco también los consumen, creando lo que se conoce como “fumador dual”. Lo peor es que son el vehículo para la inhalación de aceite de Cannabis, vitaminas liposolubles como la E, múltiples colorantes, saborizantes y aceites esenciales, además de drogas como el fentanilo.

The nicotine inhaler offers more habit replacement than any of the other forms of nicotine administration and is appropriate for smokers who are moderately addicted and need something to do with their hands. Use of nicotine replacement therapy is safe for most patients with cardiovascular disease, but should probably be restricted in pregnancy to heavy smokers who are unable to quit. Bupropion, a modest dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, increases quit rates compared with placebo. Future therapies will include combinations of nicotine replacement products, and combinations of nicotine products with other medications.

An alcohol is an organic compound with one or more hydroxyl or alcohol (- OH) groups attached. Ethanol, in particular, is the alcohol that we consume. Although the fine details of the biochem- istry of alcohol are still uncertain, it has long been suspected that the transmission of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a mostly inhibitory neurotransmitter, is somehow effected by alcohol (Paul 2006). In 2006, researchers demonstrated that the actions of GABA are amplified by the presence of alco- hol at the GABAA receptors, a ligand-gated ion channel in charge of GABA transmission (Hanchar 2006 and Wallner 2006). When GABA binds to the GABAA receptors, the pore opens, allowing chloride ions (Cl-) to rush down the electro- chemical gradient. The result is an axon with a charge more negative than one at normal resting membrane potential. Thus, depolarizing the neuron becomes extremely difficult http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/pharmaceuticals/images/rit alin.jpg Microscope view of Ritalin (Siegel 1999). Ultimately, this process impairs fluidity in movement and delays reaction time. While most alcohol consumers drink only until they are tipsy, sometimes they lose control and drink to the point of being blacked out. Later, they may possess no memory of events that had occurred during that time. This black-out period has recently been proven to be connected to the effects of alcohol on the hippocampus, an area of the brain in which short-term memories are stored (White 2000). Non-alcohol related damage to the hippocampi causes similar behavioral effects in comparison to the consequences of drinking alcohol. To illustrate, in one famous procedure, the hippocampi of a patient, HM, were removed in order to relieve his epileptic seizures. The subject continued to score above average on IQ tests despite lacking his hippocampi. Researchers also found that the patient was perfectly capable of carrying on a coherent conversation with another individ- ual. However, upon returning to the room after just a few minutes of absence, dialogue with the subject would reveal that he could neither recall who the speaker was, nor what the conversation had been about. This phenomenon closely resembles that of an alcohol induced black-out, further sug- gesting that alcohol may affect the hippocampus. So far, the alcohol side-effects of drowsy, uncoordinated movements and memory loss have been explained, but what about the symptom with which alcohol is most associated - poor judgment? Researchers have hypothesized that the frontal lobe, which controls information processing, impulse suppression, and social awareness, might be the target region that causes the lack of judgment after alcohol consumption. Sure enough, it has been shown that the short-term effects of intoxication include a decrease in metabolism and activity in the frontal lobe (Wang et al. 2000). Similarly, chronic alco- hol abuse can damage and even shrink the frontal lobe, but there is much less information on alcohol's acute effects on this region of the brain (Kril and Halliday 1999). The frontal lobe has also been chosen as an area of alco- hol research because of the similarity in behavior between intoxicated individuals and those with frontal lobe damage. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a disease that can illustrate the effects of an impaired frontal lobe, which may illuminate the impact of alcohol on this region of the brain. In patients with FTLD, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain experience tissue atrophy and shrinkage. Patients tend to lose such characteristics as: good judgment, manners, or common sense During an interview with an FTLD sufferer (to be referred to as the interviewee), the interviewee seemed normal at first, though perhaps a little too relaxed and happy to be at an by Joy Yang",

Directly and indirectly, they explain a large portion of the Soviet Union's unexplained residual death rate. Heavy drinking and alcohol abuse significantly affect the social aspects of life in the Soviet Union. As is true with respect to other Soviet social problems, there are no summary data or overall statistics on the subject, but anecdotal evidence and media and specialized reports strongly suggest that drinking is a major cause of divorce in the Soviet Union, and that women in alcoholic families have more than the average number of abortions. Soviet specialists repeatedly stress the high degree of correlation observed between violence and property crime and drinking. The impact of heavy drinking and alcohol abuse on everyday life in the Soviet Union can be illustrated by the widespread use \"sobering-up stations,\" or vytrezviteli.",

      "abstract": "Los problemas de salud mental hacen parte de las enfermedades no trasmisibles y se les atribuye, con otras enfermedades asociados al bienestar, hasta un 21 % de las muertes mundiales. Por ello, es necesario analizar y establecer la relación riesgo/beneficio de políticas relacionadas con la salud mental, caso de la legalización del consumo de cannabis recreativo en adultos. El cannabis es la droga “ilícita” de mayor consumo en los países occidentales, en esencia por incrementar la sociabilidad y la euforia. En la última década, varios países han promulgado normas orientadas a legalizar la comercialización de cannabis recreativo en adultos. En este sentido, existe controversia del efecto de este tipo de iniciativas, en el porcentaje de personas que consumen esta sustancia y en la salud de los mismos. Sin embargo, se podría esperar que este tipo de iniciativas favorezca un aumento en el porcentaje de personas que consumen esta sustancia. El aumento del consumo de marihuana puede favorecer una mayor prevalencia de problemas de salud mental, incluyendo psicosis y esquizofrenia. Se acepta la existencia de una asociación entre consumo de cannabis y psicosis (incluyendo esquizofrenia). En este marco, reconociendo los beneficios de las políticas de legalización del consumo de cannabis recreativo en adultos, orientadas a superar el enfoque prohibicionista y a buscar la reducción del daño, es conveniente evaluar y definir el efecto de las mismas. Además, estas iniciativas se deben acompañar de programas informativos y educativos, orientados a sintetizar los riesgos del consumo, incluyendo, la dependencia y problemas de salud mentales.",

The third place on the list is cocaine addiction, followed by alcohol, etc. Nicotine is a powerful psychoactive substance that disrupts bio-cell processes and changes behavior. It causes dependence on smokers, but tar is a highly potent killing substance. Therefore, in 1965 the US Congress passed a law on mandatory health warning stickers on tobacco packs. Numerous studies have shown that the health warning does not affect the reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, contrary to this warning motivates smokers to light-up a new cigarette. What actually happens in the smoker's heads and why? s the health warning a subtly designed subliminal message, or is its opposite effect a consequence of the brain filtration mechanism, or is it simply a synergy of the above-mentioned phenomena?",

      "abstract": "La présente publication a été parachevée en pleine crise du COVID‑19, au moment où les habitudes de consommation, notamment d'alcool, ont radicalement changé. Les premières données disponibles semblent indiquer que la crise a suscité chez certaines catégories de population des comportements à risque. Certains individus boivent plus, d'autres moins ; certains se livrent davantage à des épisodes d'alcoolisation massive (« binge drinking »), d'autres non. Les effets à long terme de la pandémie sur la consommation d'alcool sont incertains, mais la crise a mis en lumière certains des problèmes qui peuvent découler d'une consommation excessive. L'alcool fait généralement partie de la vie sociale, mais sa consommation nocive est relativement fréquente ; par exemple, 30 % des adultes se livrent à au moins un épisode d'alcoolisation massive par mois. Ces habitudes nocives de consommation d'alcool engendrent des coûts importants sur les plans sanitaire, social et économique. Les maladies et les blessures liées à l'alcool coûtent cher à la société. L'espérance de vie est inférieure d'environ un an à ce qu'elle serait, en moyenne, si l'on consommait moins d'alcool. En moyenne, 2.4 % des dépenses de santé sont consacrées à la prise en charge des dommages causés par l'alcool - et ce chiffre est beaucoup plus élevé dans certains pays. En outre, un mauvais état de santé dû à la consommation d'alcool a des conséquences négatives sur l'activité et la productivité.",

A war on drugs will not solve all the problems posed by cocaine. Alternative strategies must address fundamental problems in ghetto life: violence, poverty, poor health, no education, no jobs, and few reasons for not taking drugs. Despite warnings of pharmacological determinism, cocaine is like other psychoactive drugs. Even with cocaine, when alternative behaviours are possible most people avoid out-of-control use. Public health strategies promoting a harm-reduction policy offer advantages. Recent reductions in cocaine use are a consequence of education, awareness of good health practices, and interest in other activities. Alternatives could include cocaine in a safer, non-lethal and controllable form but are unlikely in a political climate where politics and law prevail rather than medicine and humanity.",

Many the youngsters regulary consume alcohol and use gambling as a way out of financial problems . It is important to see the difference between these three addictions that have many similarities and all have great negative impact on family. People that regulary use tobacco are harming people in their immediate vicinity because they inhale toxic gases that tobacco releases as passive smokers. Alcohol on the other hand is similar to drug abuse because it destroys entire families and leaves permanent consequences on the society. To completely cure the alcohol addiction of it is a very strenuous process and those that abuse alcohol consumption may have lower chances when it comes to normal work and driving a car under the influence. Gambling is mostly the biggest problem among the teenage population because the most of gambling they are involved in is not the casinos but the betting. There is no neighbourhood nor city in Croatia without a betting office inspite of the fact betting is addictive. On top of this they advertise their products all over the social media on a daily basis. Gambling is mostly used as an easy way out of the financial problems people endure these days in Croatia, but by the time they realize that making easy money overnight by constant betting only leads to higher debt, it is often too late. This thesis shows show how these industries operate and what impact it leaves on customers/consumers and the society itself and which are the main drivers that make them consume these products.",

The decision to quit coming in a later stage of life is accompanied by the fear of gaining weight after stopping smoking. The mechanism through which nicotine may be an agent in the process of controlling body weight consists in increased energy expenditure of the organism and reduced appetite. However tobacco smoking is not an effective means of combating excessive weight. This is because it stimulates formation of abdominal adipose tissue, thus increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart diseases. Therapy of tobacco addiction should be combined with diet counselling and promotion of physical activity, which will help to limit the increase of body weight.",

      "abstract": "Der vorliegende Abschnitt behandelt die Frage, unter welchen Umstaenden der Alkoholkonsument zum Taeter wird. Die beim Delikt im Verkehr festgestellten Durchschnittswerte von Blutalkoholkonzentrationen (BAK) sind so hoch, dass die Mehrheit der Bevoelkerung gar nicht faehig ist, diese bei Trinkversuchen zu erreichen. Das Verkehrsrisiko im Verkehr wird hauptsaechlich von der Gruppe der starken Trinker und der Gruppe der gelegentlichen Rauschtrinker mit erheblicher Alkoholgewoehnung verursacht. Es muessen verschiedene Gruppen von Alkoholkonsumenten und daraus abgeleitet von alkoholisierten Verkehrsteilnehmern unterschieden werden: 1. Genuss- oder Konsumtrinker mit risikoarmem durchschnittlichem Alkoholkonsum, die die Gefahren der Verkehrsteilnahme unter Alkoholeinfluss unterschaetzen. 2. An Alkohol Gewoehnte mit riskantem bis starkem Alkoholkonsum, die aufgrund der entwickelten hohen Alkoholtoleranz die koerperlichen Gefahrensignale fuer eine bestehende Trunkenheit nicht mehr zuverlaessig wahrnehmen. 3. Harte Trinker und Alkoholabhaengige, die laengst alle Verhaltensziele der Sucht untergeordnet haben und regelmaessig Alkoholfahrten in Kauf nehmen. Am haeufigsten sind Verkehrsmediziner in der Begutachtungsstelle fuer Fahreignung mit der Gruppe der Risiko- oder Schwellentrinker konfrontiert. Auf sie trifft meist die Definition des Alkoholmissbrauchs zu. Bei BAK-Werten von ueber 1,09 Promille ist in allen Faellen, unabhaengig von der persoenlichen Konstitutionen, Befindlichkeit und Alkoholvertraeglichkeit, eine Beeintraechtigung der Fahrsicherheit gegeben. Die Alkoholabhaengigen sind auch ohne Auffaelligkeit im Strassenverkehr nach Anlage 4 zur Fahrerlaubnis-Verordnung (FeV) zum Fuehren eines Kfz nicht geeignet. Signifikante neuropsychologische Defizite Alkoholkranker sind auch bei Abstinenz nicht schnell reversibel, sodass bei chronischem Alkoholmissbrauch eine Ueberpruefung des Leistungsvermoegens vor Wiedererteilung einer Fahrerlaubnis angezeigt erscheint. Die Voraussetzungen, unter denen eine Fahreignung wieder angenommen werden kann, sind im Kommentar zu den Begutachtungs-Leitlinien sowie in den Beurteilungskriterien ausfuehrlich beschrieben. Hierbei sind sowohl psychologische als auch medizinische Befunde zu beachten und haeufig interdisziplinaer zu interpretieren. Die Verkehrsmedizin hat dabei zu beantworten, wie der Alkoholkonsum in der Vorgeschichte diagnostisch einzuordnen ist und welcher Behandlungsbedarf daraus abzuleiten ist, ob ein chronischer Alkoholmissbrauch zu koerperlichen und/oder geistigen Folgeschaeden gefuehrt hat und ob aktuelle Befunde vorliegen, die mit der Behauptung einer gegebenenfalls erfolgten Distanzierung vom Alkoholkonsum nicht kompatibel sind.

Das inhalierte Aerosol enthält Feinstaub, Metallpartikel und kanzerogene Substanzen in der Regel in deutlich geringerer Konzentration als im Tabakzigarettenrauch. Aufgrund dieser Tatsache erwartet man eine gesundheitliche Schadensreduktion bei deren Anwendung. Dies ist jedoch nicht belegt, ebenso ist die mittel- und langfristige Sicherheit nicht untersucht. Die kurzfristige Anwendung führt zu Atemwegsirritationen und diastolischer Blutdrucksteigerung. Lediglich zwei randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien untersuchten bisher die Wirksamkeit und Sicherheit als Rauchstopphilfsmittel, wobei die Ergebnisse keine Überlegenheit im Vergleich zu bisherigen medikamentösen Rauchstoppmethoden belegen konnten. Aufgrund der bescheidenen Evidenzlage können E-Zigaretten nicht als Rauchstopphilfe empfohlen werden. Eines der Hauptprobleme ist die fehlende Regulierung und Standardisierung der E-Zigarettenkomponenten, sodass Verallgemeinerungen zu diesem Produkt praktisch unmöglich sind.",

Feelings of stress/anxiety demonstrated a pattern of repetitive vacilation over the day, with high stress before smoking, reduced stress after smoking, and stress levels increasing again between cigarettes. There was no evi- dence of acute pharmacodynamic tolerance, with ciga- rettes leading to altered feelings of anxiety/stress over the whole day of smoking. Self-rated feelings of arousal also demonstrated a pattern of vacilation over the day, with low arousal pre-smoking, increased arousal post-smok- ing, but arousal levels reducing again between cigarettes. The ANOVA drug x time interaction was significant, with the greatest arousal change following the first cigarette of the day. However, later cigarettes led to similar amounts of arousal change over the rest of day, thus questioning whether acute pharmacodynamic tolerance was occur- ring. Instead, the heightened arousal response to the first cigarette of the day may reflect the influence of two other factors. Firstly, overnight deprivation, with the first ciga- rette of the day leading to the greatest increase in plasma nicotine. Secondly, low early-morning arousal with its associated potential for increased arousal. Overall, there- fore, there was little indication of acute pharmacodynamic tolerance to the subjective effects of nicotine. Cigarettes were associated with altered feelings of stress and arousal, over the whole day of smoking.",

The prevalence of overweight, obesity, disordered eating behavior, and substance abuse history was assessed among female inmates incarcerated for 6 to 24 months at an Oregon state prison, using a self-administered survey and physical measurements. Average weight gain was 20 pounds, 87% of women were overweight (39%) or obese (48%), and 24% reported using one or more unhealthy strategies to lose weight in the past 6 months. Women who used tobacco and illicit substances before incarceration gained more weight. Integrating nutrition and weight gain issues into substance abuse treatment could benefit incarcerated women—both soon after entering prison to prevent weight gain and close to release to prevent relapse into substance use.",

Erste Anzeichen deuten darauf hin, dass die Krise in bestimmten Bevölkerungsgruppen ein riskantes Trinkverhalten ausgelöst hat. Manche Menschen trinken seither mehr, manche weniger; manche konsumieren häufiger exzessiv Alkohol, andere wiederum nicht. Die langfristigen Auswirkungen der Pandemie auf den Alkoholkonsum sind ungewiss, doch die Krise hat den Blick auf einige der Probleme gelenkt, die durch den schädlichen Konsum von Alkohol entstehen können. Alkohol ist in der Regel Teil des gesellschaftlichen Lebens, aber schädlicher Alkoholkonsum ist relativ häufig; so trinken 30 % der Erwachsenen zum Beispiel mindestens einmal im Monat exzessiv Alkohol. Schädliche Muster des Alkoholkonsums verursachen erhebliche gesundheitliche, soziale und wirtschaftliche Kosten. Alkoholbedingte Krankheiten und Verletzungen verursachen hohe Kosten für die Gesellschaft. Die Lebenserwartung ist fast ein Jahr niedriger als sie im Durchschnitt wäre, wenn die Menschen weniger Alkohol konsumieren würden. Durchschnittlich 2,4 % der Gesundheitsausgaben werden für die Bewältigung von Schäden durch den Konsum von Alkohol aufgewendet – in einigen Ländern ist dieser Anteil noch deutlich höher. Darüber hinaus wirkt sich ein schlechter Gesundheitszustand aufgrund von Alkoholkonsum nachteilig auf Erwerbsbeteiligung und Produktivität aus.",

Only some drug users develop drug abuse (i.e., a compulsive drug use that becomes the principal goal-directed behavior of the subject) (O’Brien et al. 1986).

We reviewed the main evidence available using the standard Prescrire methodology. The clinical consequences for the patient of crushing tablets or opening capsules can be serious: alteration of the drug's absorption can result in sometimes fatal overdose, or conversely underdosing, rendering the treatment ineffective. When it disrupts a drug's sustained-release properties, the active ingredient is no longer released and absorbed gradually, resulting in overdose. When a gastro-resistant layer is destroyed by crushing, underdosing is likely. The active ingredient released may degrade on contact with light, moisture or the food with which it is mixed for administration. The person who crushes the tablets or opens the capsules is exposed to drug particles, which may be carcinogenic, teratogenic or fetotoxic. They are sometimes allergenic. In practice, there are many drugs that should never be crushed or opened. Before crushing a tablet or opening a capsule, it is better to consider and research the impact it will have on the drug's effects. It is sometimes preferable to use a different dosage form, or a different active ingredient.",

Ook blijkt het voorkomen van combinaties van ongezonde gedragingen onafhankelijk te zijn van factoren uit de sociale en fysieke leefomgeving van de persoon, zoals gezinssamenstelling en mate van verstedelijking. De combinatie van twee ongezonde gedragingen geeft wel een grotere kans op vroegtijdig overlijden dan de risicoberekening hierover voor het afzonderlijke gedrag, maar deze is niet excessief groter.

Auf der Basis der psychosozialen und neurobiologischen Modelle für die Entstehung der Tabakabhängigkeit sind die hohen Rückfallquoten bei Abstinenzversuchen zu erklären. Die Tabakabhängigkeit weist dabei alle Kriterien der Abhängigkeitsentwicklung auf.",

      "abstract": "'Consonant' smokers know and accept the risks associated with tobacco consumption, and do not wish to change their smoking, whereas 'dissonant' smokers are tobacco consumers whose attitudes differ from their behaviour. Dissonant smokers have several options: to quit smoking (the optimal solution), reduce their smoking, switch products or brands, or do nothing. To date, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the best-established medical aid to smoking cessation, but several important factors impact on NRT use. As smokers constitute a diverse group there is a need for various different formulations, some of which will suit certain smokers better than others. Smokers should be allowed to select their preferred products in order to increase compliance, and should also be permitted to combine various products if desired. Adequate dosage regimens should be stressed in order to avoid under-dosing, which is common with NRT. It is also essential that the medical system focuses increasingly on the diagnosis and treatment of those smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking. High nicotine dependence correlates with a high risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease; because these smokers cannot quit, cessation efforts have little impact on the incidence of tobacco-related diseases in this population. Additional smoking control interventions, such as smoking reduction therapy, are therefore required to treat this group. Our experience in Vienna shows that these smokers can be targeted through approaches that utilize new messages offering alternatives to cessation.",

Should I encourage adolescents to choose e-cigarettes over regular cigarettes if they decide to smoke? Are e-cigarettes less harmful and a potential smoking cessation method for adolescents? Answer While e-cigarettes do not have carcinogenic tobacco, most contain nicotine, which not only leads to addiction, but can also impair brain development and cognitive function in youth. Recent studies have also shown that adolescents who use e-cigarettes are more likely to begin smoking tobacco cigarettes. It is therefore essential that physicians explain to adolescents the risks and health concerns e-cigarettes present, and implement measures to prevent or cease e-cigarette use.",

      "title": "Smokeless tobacco use in sports: ‘legal doping’?",
      "abstract": "Smokeless tobacco (ST) use is common in some sports. Nicotine is a psychomotor stimulant and this raises the issue of whether such use constitutes that of a performance-enhancing drug. Most of the data come from baseball players. Both adolescent and adult baseball players use ST [1]. Among major league players, 45% have been reported to use ST [2]. The amount of nicotine extracted from ST ranges between 20 and 45% and bioavailability is 40–60% of the extracted amount. Plasma levels peak after 30 minutes, with values which could reach an average of 20–30 ng/ml at the end of the day (similar to moderate-to-heavy smoking) [3]. ST users are thus exposed to a large amount of nicotine over a longer period than from smoking [4, 5]. Nicotine has been found in some studies to enhance information processing and attentional processes in humans [6]. The robustness of this effect and whether in smokers it represents more than normalization of impairment experienced as a result of nicotine withdrawal has been debated [7, 8]. In baseball ST users there are only limited data. Escher et al. [9] assessed muscular force, reaction time and choice reaction time in athlete ST users (under abstinence) versus non-users. ST users showed a stronger force, a slower choice reaction time but no difference in simple reaction time. A study by Robertson et al. [10], compared field performance between ST users versus non-users by using common baseball statistics parameters. Although the authors concluded that there were no substantial differences between the two groups, we contacted baseball experts from the Italian Federation of Baseball and Softball in order to understand the relevance of these parameters to field performance (for a comprehensive list, see the Major League website: http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/baseball_basics/abbreviations.jsp). For instance, experts highlighted that a difference of score equal to 1 in the parameter ‘stolen bases’ (which requires a fast synchronization of vigilance and motor action) between ST users (average score 5.2, from [10]) and non-users (average score 4.2 [10]) may be relevant during a match (Paolo Castagnini, Board member of Italian Federation of Baseball and Softball, personal communication). Moreover, there are statistical parameters called ‘clutch’, which measure field performance during critical moments of the match. Indeed, higher values for these parameters are an expression of a better integration between cognitive and motor processes, such as perception, vigilance, divided attention, decision-making and executive outcome, in order to meet demanding game situations. These key moments of the match are also characterized by high alertness and arousal states, as well as by a higher stress condition. Slight changes in ‘clutch’ statistic values may have a significant impact on the competition. In these cases, the modest enhancement induced by ST use may make a difference in performance that could affect the outcome of a highly competitive baseball match, where teams and players appear to be well balanced. Thus, while the limited set of available data suggest that some psychometric values are not changed in baseball ST users under abstinence, no data are available from the field, or even from the laboratory, under actual ST exposure. The question still remains: are those subjects who are taking ST benefiting from legal doping? We suggest that ST effects should be tested on field parameters which are relevant to the specific desired effect in sports such as baseball, rather than the ‘traditional’ psychometric measures. At present, there is limited translation or modelling of complex psychomotor performance - as in sports - into the laboratory. Although specific models have been developed to study sport performance in the laboratory, valid experimental paradigms are still lacking for investigations on the effects of addictive substances on complex psychomotor performance. A possible experimental approach is to begin by correlating the statistical data available on baseball performances in the United States with information on ST use of leading players. The results of such correlations may support experimental placebo-controlled studies on any enhancing effects of low- or high-nicotine ST. We believe that if ST is shown to enhance performance, then there may be a case for banning its use in baseball and possibly other sports. Of course, if ST were to be banned, the fact that it is addictive would mean that users would need to be offered help with achieving and sustaining abstinence. It would also raise issues concerning whether smoking tobacco and even the use of pure nicotine delivery systems should also be banned. This is a difficult area, but it makes sense to begin the debate now and start collecting relevant data.",

      "abstract": "A new product which is an electronic cigarette acting as nicotine delivery has been marketed at early 2000s. An electronic cigarette generates nicotine aerosol from a solution comprised of several basic substances, nicotine and flavours. The electronic cigarettes were widely promoted by a manufacturer like a safe product substituting tobacco smoking during quitting period. As a result, their consumption has been increasing progressively worldwide. Investigators of the aerosol content reported that it mainly contains ultrafine particles which easily penetrate into alveoli and blood vessels. The aerosol also contains nitrosamines, toxic substances and heavy metals. Strong evidence has been made about the aerosol cytotoxicity that could lead to serious injury and diseases. Nicotine dependence was demonstrated to develop as a result of an electronic cigarette smoking. While smoking an electronic cigarette, the indoor air concentration of toxic substances could reach hazardous levels. Electronic cigarettes do not have any advantage and cannot be considered as a mean to quit tobacco smoking. Moreover, electronic cigarette consumers were shown to quit smoking significantly harder. A large body of scientific confirmation of hazardous effect of electronic cigarettes on a human either during active or passive smoking have been obtained. It is no doubt that further investigations are needed especially with regards to rapid change in the market of electronic cigarettes. To minimize adverse effect of electronic cigarettes both on an individual and on population at whole certain measures should be undertaken intended to limitation of demand and supply of electronic cigarettes in the country similar to those for typical tobacco products.",

Blood samples were obtained before and after 10 chippers (smoking up to 5 cigarettes per day) and 12 dependent smokers (20 to 40 cigarettes per day) smoked a cigarette. Chippers' blood nicotine levels increased significantly, in amounts equaling those of dependent smokers. Assays of cotinine (a long-lasting nicotine metabolite) also suggested that chippers' per-cigarette nicotine absorption equaled that of dependent smokers. Chippers' cotinine levels were also compared with those of heavy smokers (38 cigarettes per day) whose consumption was reduced to 5 cigarettes per day in a previously published study. The heavy smokers compensated by tripling their per-cigarette nicotine intake. Chippers did not seem to be compensating; their cotinine values equaled those expected when regular smokers were not compensating for reduced cigarette availability.",

      "abstract": "Acute marijuana use is classically associated with snacking behavior (colloquially referred to as \"the munchies\"). In support of these acute appetite-enhancing effects, several authorities report that marijuana may increase body mass index in patients suffering from human immunodeficiency virus and cancer. However, for these medical conditions, while appetite may be stimulated, some studies indicate that weight gain is not always clinically meaningful. In addition, in a study of cancer patients in which weight gain did occur, it was less than the comparator drug (megestrol). However, data generally suggest that acute marijuana use stimulates appetite, and that marijuana use may stimulate appetite in low-weight individuals. As for large epidemiological studies in the general population, findings consistently indicate that users of marijuana tend to have lower body mass indices than nonusers. While paradoxical and somewhat perplexing, these findings may be explained by various study confounds, such as potential differences between acute versus chronic marijuana use; the tendency for marijuana use to be associated with other types of drug use; and/or the possible competition between food and drugs for the same reward sites in the brain. Likewise, perhaps the effects of marijuana are a function of initial weight status-i.e., maybe marijuana is a metabolic regulatory substance that increases body weight in low-weight individuals but not in normal-weight or overweight individuals. Only further research will clarify the complex relationships between marijuana and body weight.",

Acamprosate and naltrexone reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence rates, although the effects appear to be modest. Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion. Ondansetron may reduce alcohol use, particularly in selected subpopulations. Further study is needed for genetically targeted or as-needed medications to reduce alcohol use.",

      "abstract": "In the hope of reducing the adverse health consequences of smoking, physicians frequently advise their patients who cannot quit to smoke fewer cigarettes. Habitual smokers may compensate for the reduced number of cigarettes, however, by taking in more smoke per cigarette. We measured the intake of tar (estimated as mutagenic activity of the urine), nicotine, and carbon monoxide during short-term cigarette restriction. With a reduction from an average of 37 cigarettes to an average of 5 cigarettes per day, the intake of tobacco toxins per cigarette increased roughly threefold and daily exposure to tar and carbon monoxide declined only 50 percent. We conclude that smoking fewer cigarettes may reduce exposure to toxins and related adverse health consequences. However, consistent with a tendency to maintain intake of nicotine, the magnitude of the benefit is much less than expected. Whether \"oversmoking\" persists during long-term restriction of cigarettes requires further investigation.",

      "title": "Debunking the Myth",
      "abstract": "“Wow — almost 2 h!” This was the response from my first-grade daughter as she finished adding up the number of minutes she had jogged to “burn off” the calories in a popular child meal combo from a large fast food chain. She was putting the final touches on her science project, which involved eating the meal, looking up the nutrition facts online, and completing multiple bouts of running (across several days) while wearing an activity tracking device. In line with my daughter’s reaction, I suspect that the average American has a highly skewed notion about the amount of activity required to negate all the calories he or she consumes. And the gross overestimation of the capacity of exercise to burn the extra calories we collectively consume is likely one of the culprits of the obesity epidemic we face today. The consequences of allowing the myth to be perpetuated have at least two major consequences for youth with obesity: 1) we set up a false expectation for these children and their families, who after exercising and failing to lose weight, may experience disappointment and decide to abandon exercise altogether; and 2) we create a potentially subversive and counterproductive scenario in which nonadherence to appropriate dietary modification might be rationalized by an individual who assumes that any extra calories consumed can be canceled out easily and quickly by exercising just a little more. Therefore, the benefits and limitations of exercise need to be accurately portrayed and placed into an appropriate context whenever physical activity counseling is offered to individuals with obesity. Exercise can aid in weight loss, just not nearly as much as most people think. In the current issue of the Journal, “Exercise for Obese Youth: Refocusing Attention from Weight Loss to Health Gains,” Shaibi et al. (3) expertly detail how exercise produces multiple beneficial health outcomes that are, unfortunately, too often deemphasized in favor of weight-based end points in many clinical trials. Indeed, exercise training can improve insulin resistance, beta-cell function, glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and vascular function, to name only a handful of benefits (3). One additional aspect of exercise and physical activity not fully appreciated is the role they play in weight loss maintenance. As described by investigators of the National Weight Control Registry study, physical activity appears to be indispensable in relation to preventing weight regain among adults (1,2). However, less is known about the role of physical activity on weight loss maintenance in children. Perhaps similar studies can be undertaken in children to improve our understanding regarding physical activity and weight loss maintenance and underscore their importance in the treatment schema. At some point, hopefully not far on the horizon, effective and sustainable nonsurgical treatments will be available for children and adolescents afflicted with obesity. And when that day arrives, exercise will continue to be an important part of the equation, particularly as the focus begins to shift toward maintaining a healthy body weight and addressing risk factors for other chronic diseases. In the interim, we as a research and health care community should continue to tout all of the health benefits of exercise, yet challenge the commonly held assumption about its role in weight loss (i.e., a little activity can go a long way toward burning off those extra calories). In so doing, we might cause some parents to think twice about pulling up to the fast food window so frequently and free up some time for their first grader who may be interested in doing things other than jogging for 2 h · d-1.

      "abstract": "El mantenimiento del equilibrio energetico constituye un elemento esencial para todos, pero lo es aun mas para las atletas. El equilibrio energetico es alcanzado cuando la cantidad de energia ingerida (por ejemplo, todas las comidas y bebidas consumidas) equiparan la energia gastada en todo el dia. Tu gasto de energia se compone de tres partes: 1) tu gasto energetico de reposo, o la cantidad de energia que usarias si permanecieras acostada; 2) tu gasto energetico proveniente las actividades diarias normales, tales como caminar hasta la parada de bus u ocuparse de las tareas del hogar; y 3) tu gasto energetico del ejercicio, tal como salir a correr, bailar, o nadar. Este ultimo componente generalmente es el mas variable entre las personas, e individuos que a traves del ejercicio regular consumen muchas mas energias que una persona sedentaria. Por tanto, estar fisicamente activa y participar en algun deporte requiere que alcances niveles mas altos de ingesta energetica para prevenir un deficit energetico.",

      "title": "Restriktive Flüssigkeitszufuhr in der Terminalphase kann Leiden reduzieren",
      "abstract": "Das Für und Wider von künstlicher Ernährung inkl. Flüssigkeitszufuhr am Lebensende ist häufig Quelle von Auseinandersetzungen. Leiden Sterbende unter Hunger, weil sie nicht mehr essen – muss man sie also künstlich ernähren, spüren Sterbende Atemnot, weil sie aufhören zu atmen – muss man sie also künstlich beatmen? Vergleichbares kann zum Durst ausgeführt werden, weiß man doch schon lange, dass künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr zumeist nicht geeignet ist, den Durst zu löschen [6]. Auf jeden Fall wird in diesen Situationen unabhängig von einer künstlichen Flüssigkeitszufuhr immer die konsequente und phantasievolle Mundpflege notwendig sein: So können etwa Sprühflaschen benutzt werden und kleine Eisstücke aus dem Lieblingsgetränk in den Mund gelegt werden [5]. Als Nachteile einer künstlichen Flüssigkeitszufuhr werden etwa die Zunahme von Ödemen, die Abhängigkeit von Pflegepersonal oder Ärzten oder die Verlängerung des Todesrasselns genannt [5, 7]. Todesrasseln und Atemnot sind die häufigsten belastenden Symptome in der Finalphase [6]. In einer Auswertung von 57 Sterbebegleitungen im Hospiz St. Hildegard, Bochum, aus dem Jahr 2004 wurde in keinem Fall ein Todesrasseln über mehr als 12 Stunden beobachtet, wenn entsprechend dem Patientenwillen allenfalls eine geringe künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr bei sorgfältiger Mundpflege erfolgte. Nur bei 8 Gästen (14%) trat überhaupt ein Todesrasseln auf. Bei 5 Gästen (63%) dieser Gruppe war eine ärztliche Symptomkontrolle aufgrund objektiver Stresszeichen (z.B. fahrige Armbewegungen, Schwitzen, Stöhnen, Tränenlaufen) notwendig. Demgegenüber erfolgte nur bei 8 von 49 Gästen ohne dieses Symptom ein ärztliches Eingreifen in der Sterbephase (16%). Die Dauer des Todesrasselns wird mit durchschnittlich 57 Stunden angegeben [2], Angaben zur Inzidenz variieren zwischen 23–80% [4, 7]. Während die Sterbephase unter Exsikkose von Beobachtern durchweg als nicht qualvoll und friedlich beschrieben wird, erzeugt das mitunter laute Todesrasseln nicht nur bei Angehörigen und Pflegenden den Anschein eines qualvollen Todeskampfes, oft ergeben sich hier aus palliativmedizinischer Sicht objektive Zeichen des Stresses, die einer invasiven Symptomkontrolle bedürfen. Eine unbefriedigende Symptomkontrolle trotz Therapie wird bei ca. 30% dieser Patienten angegeben [3]. Aktuelle palliativmedizinische Literatur empfiehlt letztlich die künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr bei Verdacht auf das Vorliegen einer behandelbaren Störung (z.B. Verwirrung infolge Dehydratation. Ohne Symptome wird lediglich der Einsatz einer phantasievollen Mundpflege empfohlen [1, 5]. Dies können wir anhand unserer Erfahrungen bestätigen. Voraussetzung für jede Entscheidung am Lebensende sind die konsequente Behandlung sämtlicher Symptome und die Aufklärung aller Beteiligten, auch der Angehörigen und Pflegenden.",

Also common is the combined use of alcohol and marijuana, producing additive effects. Although users generally express the belief that marijuana impairs their driving ability, many nevertheless drive after drug use. In addition to impaired perception and psychomotor performance, attentional failure accounts for much of the marijuana-induced driving impairment. Performance decrements may persist for some hours after recovery from the subjective effects of marijuana. The impact of marijuana use on driving ability is dose-related. Enforcement authorities are considering a scale of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the drug's active ingredient) in the blood or breath that may correlate with blood alcohol levels as indicators of driving under the influence, although the metabolism of THC is more complex than that of alcohol.",

When used with alcohol, the 'disulfiram-alcohol reaction' occurs, causing nausea and vomiting.

These undesirable symptoms are similar to the side effects that occur to oncological patients after the administration of chemotherapy. : Descriptive research method was used. The literature focusing on alcohol, medications and drug consumption was reviewed. : The primary abstinence at the beginning of treatment with Disulfiram does not guarantee that alcohol usage will not get manifested again at the further stages of treatment. Alcohol addiction forces patients to search for a way to avoid the unwanted reactions. Sometimes, patients tend to be quite ingenious while trying to suppress the arising side effects. In many cases, it involves the usage of additional medication. : When alcohol addiction overpowers, the patient tries to reduce the undesirable symptoms and may even die if alcohol is combined with disulfiram.

      "abstract": "In addition to common stressors, members of the U.S. Armed Forces experience a high level of stress unique to their status as service members. In an effort to combat stress, many military personnel report high levels of nicotine use. This study investigated the relationship between tobacco use and perceived stress among military members in all four armed services. Results indicate that those who use tobacco products specifically to reduce stress report significantly higher stress levels than those who do not use tobacco. Moreover, current users and those who both smoked and used smokeless tobacco were far more likely to report experiencing \"a lot\" of stress from a variety of sources than former or never users. Tobacco users also engaged more frequently in negative coping behaviors and relied less on the positive coping strategies used more often by former or never smokers. These findings are consistent with the larger body of literature suggesting that tobacco is not only an ineffective stress-reducing strategy, it also likely perpetuates a stress response in users. It is, therefore, critical that the military improve effective means of coping among nicotine-using troops.",

Na análise citada, cabe também ressaltar que alguns estudos foram contra o propósito do trabalho. Por fim, é importante salientar que os danos à saúde oriundos do cigarro eletrônico são semelhantes aos causados por tabacos convencionais, originando principalmente sintomas respiratórios e cardiovasculares. Além disso, existem outros estudos que defendem a substituição do tabaco convencional pelos cigarros eletrônicos. A ausência de pesquisas que discutam detalhadamente os efeitos a longo prazo do uso desses dispositivos impede o cálculo preciso da nocividade à saúde humana, tornando-se evidente a continuação e ampliação de estudos.",

      "title": "In Focus",
      "abstract": "adulterants, substance use disorder, opioids: Drug users may not get what they bargained for when buying pills, powder, or other forms of drugs from a street dealer. Contaminants and adulterants are found in the vast majority of drugs bought on the street, and cocaine, heroin, and other opioids are rarely pure drugs. Even pharmaceutical-grade pills are often bogus, even if packaged to appear to be from a legitimate source. Illicitly manufactured drugs commonly contain additional pharmacologically active components used to increase the bulk of the product, simulate a street drug's effects, or to enhance the potency of the primary product. There are no controls or quality measurers used in these adulterants, they can be chemicals or products from around the home or garage, and the additives themselves can be toxic.FigurePrescription opioids account for about a third of all deaths from opioid use, and they sometimes have numerous adulterants that are doled out to unsuspecting users. Pure cocaine and heroin are rarely available on the street these days, with many additives and contaminants used to increase the amount of the substance sold and to produce symptoms similar to those of the pure drug. Likewise, unadulterated opioids are rarely available to drug users, and it is quite amazing how many nonopioid contaminants can be found in these substances. The number of overdose deaths increased from 23,500 in 2002 to 70,200 in 2017, and opioid deaths increased fourfold, from 11,900 in 2002 to 47,600 in 2017. (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2018;67[5152]:1419; https://bit.ly/3eiTdOK; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. December 2018.) Many of these deaths were related to the user unknowingly using adulterated or tainted street drugs. The Emerging Role of Toxic Adulterants in Street Drugs in the U.S. Illicit Opioid Crisis Singh VM, Browne T, Montgomery J Public Health Rep. 2020;135(1):6 https://bit.ly/2SR0Zbn The rate of opioid overdose deaths rose from 42,000 in 2016 to 47,600 in 2017, a 13 percent increase in just one year. Deaths from cocaine and the number of overdose deaths related to prescription opioids, however, have remained relatively constant. A total of 28,400 of the estimated 38,000 opioid deaths in 2018 involved non-methadone synthetic opioids; the most common was illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Fentanyl as an adulterant was largely responsible for the increased number of deaths, but the presence and danger of multiple toxic adulterants are also important issues in opioid-related deaths. Importantly, the number of deaths from prescription opioids was and still is declining. About 60 percent of opioid-related deaths now are due to non-methadone synthetic opioid adulterants. This is a marked 45 percent increase from the previous year, highlighting the fact that manufactured opioids have become the main driver of the nation's opioid crisis. Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are produced in clandestine laboratories rather than commercial pharmaceutical laboratories. Synthetic opioids have been detected in about 60 percent of opioid-related deaths. Ninety percent of those who died from opioids in Florida had nonopioid toxic components in their system at autopsy. Illicit fentanyl is clearly complicating and amplifying the death rate from opioids. It is sold on the street as a powder and mixed with heroin and other less potent opioids. Fentanyl and other added lethal adulterants often go undetected and unreported because current toxicology laboratories are unable to identify them. Suspected but unidentified adulterants can lead to renal and liver problems, blood disorders, infectious diseases, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest. An additional pharmacologically active substance was found in 97 percent of street drug samples in Vermont and in 89 percent of those in Kentucky. As many as nine additional components were identified in these samples. It would not be uncommon to find as many as 11 additional components in the systems of those who died of drug overdose at autopsy. Obviously, failure to recognize or identify toxic adulterants will hinder timely and appropriate treatment and could even interfere with life-saving measures. The presence of multiple pharmacologically active components in street drugs is simply amazing. The table demonstrates the amazing number of components found in street drugs seized as cocaine in Kentucky and Vermont in 2017. Determination of Cutting Agents in Seized Cocaine Sample Using GC-MS, GC-TMS and LC-MS/MS Fiorentin TR, Fogarty M, et al. Forensic Sci Int. 2019;295:199 The authors of this study attempted to quantify cocaine and cutting agents in 116 samples of cocaine using sophisticated laboratory methods. The analysis was done at the NMS Laboratories in Willow Grove, PA, probably the most advanced toxicology laboratory in the country. NMS uses gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and other state-of-the-art tests not generally available to clinicians. The testing was done specifically to evaluate for cocaine, levamisole, benzocaine, phenacetin hydroxyzine, theophylline, acetaminophen, and caffeine. Cocaine was the only compound in only 17 percent of samples billed as cocaine. The most common cutting drug was levamisole, found in 80 percent of all samples. The percentage of levamisole in the samples was occasionally as high as 75 percent. This is one of many articles showing that street drugs are nowhere near what is advertised. Many agents are added to give a CNS effect or produce an effect that the user would identify as that of the sought-after illicit compound. Complications from adulterants can be significant. Cardiac arrest and other cardiac complications have been well described from quinine and quinidine used to cut heroin sold to IV drug users. (J Gen Intern Med 2012;27[12]:1722; https://bit.ly/3r9fNi2.) Levamisole has increasingly been found in street cocaine as an adulterant (Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2010;88[3]:408), and this may have led to the withdrawal of the drug from the U.S. market. Levamisole was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an immunomodulator, a chemotherapy adjuvant, and an anthelmintic medication. Toxicology laboratories will not routinely assay for levamisole. The purpose of adulterating street cocaine with levamisole is not known. It has been speculated that it is added to potentiate the effects of cocaine. There have also been reports of the metabolism of levamisole to aminorex in racehorses. Aminorex and related compounds, specifically 4-methylaminorex, or “ice,” have high abuse potential because of their amphetamine-like pharmacological activity, but the intended role of levamisole in street cocaine remains unclear. Cardiac Complications of Unwitting Co-injection of Quinine/Quinidine with Heroin in an IV Drug User Phillips KA, Hirsch GA, et al. J Gen Intern Med. 2012;27(12):1722 https://bit.ly/3r9fNi2 This article emphasizes the omnipresence of unusual products used to cut street drugs and some of the bizarre complications encountered by the unwary drug user. Clinicians in an ideal world would be able to quickly identify contaminants and be equipped to deal with the accompanying complications, but this is clearly not possible given the many adulterants used by drug dealers. The clinicians in this case identified the presence of quinine/quinidine in a street drug sold as heroin. The purity of heroin sold in Baltimore in 2019 ranged from an amazingly low zero to 36 percent, according to the Baltimore office of the DEA. Adulterants included acetaminophen, caffeine, diphenhydramine, methorphan, alprazolam, quetiapine, chloroquine, diltiazem, cocaine, procaine, lidocaine, quinine/quinidine, phenacetin, and thiamine. The authors reported the case of an asymptomatic 31-year-old man participating in a drug research study who was found to have an accelerated atrioventricular junctional rhythm on an ECG performed before the study. This patient had a complicated medical history, including IV heroin dependence, hepatitis C, and tobacco dependence. He was taking methadone (100 mg/day) but had no symptoms on initial evaluation. His vital signs and initial laboratory tests were normal, and a drug screen was positive for methadone. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed minimal abnormalities, including an ejection fraction of 50%-55%, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and trace pulmonary and mitral regurgitation. The most common cause of accelerated junctional rhythm is digitalis toxicity, but it can be caused by a number of other medications and conditions. A GC/MS analysis of the patient's urine identified codeine/morphine, methadone, acetaminophen, and quinine/quinidine. Methadone is associated with bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, faintness, and syncope. Note that a urine GM/MS toxicology test cannot differentiate between quinidine and quinine, but that differentiation is not clinically required for the emergency physician. The accelerated atrioventricular junctional rhythm reported in this case has not been associated with methadone. Quinine/quinidine was the second most common adulterant in heroin in Baltimore and was found in 64 percent of samples in 2009-1010. Quinine/quinidine as an adulterant produces a bitter heroin-like taste, and the hypotensive rush produced can mimic a heroin rush. Both characteristics are used by drug buyers to identify heroin on the street by tasting a small drug sample, an activity often seen on TV shows. An amazing number of adulterants have been found in street drug samples throughout the country. Levamisole was found in 62 percent of cocaine-positive urine samples in 2009. Why levamisole would be used as a cutting agent for cocaine is confusing. It can cause agranulocytosis, ear lobe necrosis, and laboratory findings of antiphospholipid syndrome. (Find additional discussion about the toxicology of levamisole in EMN. 2019;41[10]:16; http://bit.ly/2osdXN6 and EMN. 2014;36[5]:1; https://bit.ly/3B59FfB.) - Common Adulterants and Contaminants in Opioids and Cocaine Street Samples Acetaminophen Quetiapine Aminopyrine Cocaine Diltiazem Heroin Diphenhydramine Papaverine Dipyrone Acetyl codeine Levamisole Noscapine Phenacetin Tramadol Caffeine Ketamine Quinine Lidocaine Phenacetin Fentanyl Eighty-three percent of street drug samples collected in Vermont contained five or more components, and 15 percent contained nine or more. Eighty-nine percent of samples collected in Kentucky contained one additional pharmacologically active component, and 32 percent had five or more additional components.Source: Public Health Rep. 2020;135(1):6; https://bit.ly/2SR0Zbn. No significant clinical complications were noted, and this patient did not stop using heroin, but he did decrease his use. An ECG repeated three days later showed sinus bradycardia with a period of atrioventricular dissociation plus slight junctional acceleration, which occurred at a slower rate than in earlier ECGs. A cardiologist confirmed that this change reflected an improvement in the rate and rhythm. The patient's decreased heroin use presumably resulted in decreased unwitting co-injection of quinine/quinidine, accompanied by a dose-related improvement in ECG parameters. This case illustrated an accelerated junctional rhythm that may have resulted from a drug or drugs unwittingly injected during intravenous heroin use. Drug adulterants may produce arrhythmias or other medical complications, as well as toxicity from unsuspected drug-drug interactions. Quinidine alone has more than 135 major interactions. (See common ones in the table.) When treating patients who use illicit drugs, physicians should look beyond the known drugs of abuse for adulterants and diluents to determine possible etiologies of cardiac and other medical complications. Clinicians should also be aware that standard urine toxicology tests do not detect diluents and adulterants, and that tests such as a urine GC/MS should be performed if the clinical picture warrants it. Obviously, given the tremendous number of adulterants and substitutions found in street drugs, it is impossible for the clinician to identify all such interventions to street drugs. It seems like few street drugs are exactly as advertised, and clandestine activities by drug dealers will only increase. Exactly how far the clinician should go in pursuing these issues is a puzzle.

In the present study a sample of 38 heroin users, half smokers and half injectors, was investigated using several drugs career indices. Results showed that users display preferences, with the use of some drugs being favoured over time. Injectors used all drugs more frequently than smokers. Although there was much variability in frequency of use the trend over the initial 3 years of use showed no increase in heroin use for either smokers or injectors. Although the majority of smokers had injected heroin there was no evidence that this group favoured injecting over time; rather the data suggested that smoking became the increasingly preferred method of consumption. Smokers were more likely than injectors to use other drugs post-heroin. Contrary to expectation, few periods of abstinence were reported by the subjects in either group.",

      "title": "Successful Multiorgan Donation From a Brain-dead Donor Following Liquid Nicotine Voluntary Intoxication: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The electronic cigarette was invented in 2003 by Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, as an alternative source of nicotine to traditional tobacco products and coincided with the development of some nicotine replacement therapies. From the beginning of 2004, it spread widely on Western European and American markets and subsequently worldwide. Instead of burning tobacco leaves, electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that aerosolize liquid nicotine by heating a solution that contains different proportions of nicotine, glycerol, propylene glycol, and flavoring agents.1 Nicotine is a hazardous, highly toxic, and very addictive substance extracted from tobacco leaves. Exposure to elevated doses of nicotine may cause acute intoxication and eventually acute respiratory and cardiovascular failure, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death. Cases of nicotine intoxication after conventional cigarette exposure, transdermal nicotine patches, or tobacco leaves have been reported. Yet, as electronic cigarette use increases, so has the number of both accidental and voluntary liquid nicotine intoxications. Accidental or unintentional intoxication involves mainly children under 10 y of age, whereas that of older patients is most likely voluntary and considered a suicide attempt.1-4 We present a case of multiorgan donation from a brain-dead donor admitted to our unit after resuscitation from cardiorespiratory arrest due to a voluntary intake of liquid nicotine with an autolytic aim. CASE DESCRIPTION A 26-y-old male individual was found unconscious by his parents on the floor of his room. He had a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder from childhood, had given up cannabis, cocaine, and metilenedioximethanphetamine abuse, and had survived several suicide attempts, the last of which consisted of jumping from a fifth floor and resulted in L2 spinal cord injury, spastic syndrome, neurogenic bladder, and bowel dysfunction. He was under treatment with venlafaxine, mirtazapine, lorazepam, gabapentin, aripiprazole, levetiracetam, and baclofen. Upon arrival of the emergency medical service, the patient was in cardiorespiratory arrest, so advanced cardiac life support maneuvers were initiated and performed for 40 minutes. When asked, his parents reported finding an empty 50 mL bottle of liquid nicotine beside him but denied a smoking or vaping habit. After spontaneous circulation was restored, he was transferred to the hospital. On arrival, his vital signs were as follow: blood pressure: 140/70 mm Hg; heart rate: 90 beats/min; temperature: 37 °C; respiratory rate (on mechanical ventilation): 20 breaths/min; arterial blood gas analysis (sample drawn on arrival at the emergency department): pH: 6.77; Pco2: 101 mm Hg; Po2: 28.5 mm Hg; HCO3: 6.6 mmol/L; EB: –26.1 mmol/L; satO2: 19.3%. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he was unresponsive, had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, fixed and dilated pupils, and abolished brainstem reflexes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests were as follow: leucocytes: 17.000/mm3, hemoglobin: 14.5 g/dL; platelets and coagulation tests were normal; serum creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase: 187 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase: 133; amylase: 160 U/L; and creatine kinase: 193 U/L. Arterial blood gas analysis after 6 h on mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen: pH: 7.37; Po2: 177 mm Hg; Pco2: 32.5 mm Hg; HCO3: 32.5 mmol/L; satO2: 100%. The electrocardiogram showed a regular sinus rhythm with a rate of 100/min and no abnormalities despite the long-lasting resuscitation maneuvers. Urine drug screening was positive for tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines, while urine sediment examination was normal. On admittance, a urine sample was obtained for testing the cotinine (nicotine metabolite) level and sent to the Reference Laboratory. The ELISA result was >2000 ng/mL (normal value <500 ng/mL). A few h after admittance, a diagnosis of clinical brain death was established through complete and protocolized neurological examination and then confirmed by electroencephalography, which showed a plain and unresponsive to pain 30-minute recording. The cause of death was hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy caused by prolonged cardiorespiratory arrest due to nicotine intoxication. In the abdominal echography, the liver was hyperechogenic with mild to moderate steatosis; both kidneys were normal, with good corticomedullary differentiation, and their length was 11.5 cm (on the long axis). Echocardiography showed a nondilated left ventricle, normal wall thickness, normal global systolic function (ejection fraction over 70%) without any altered segmental wall function and normal atria; the valves had a normal function and morphology, as well as the pericardium. The transplant coordinator was contacted. Family and judicial authorization for organ donation was requested (the latter is compulsory in Spain for violent deaths). The patient was proposed as a multiorgan donor, including heart, kidneys, and pancreas. The liver was discarded due to analytic and echographic disturbances. The Spanish National Transplant Organization organized the distribution of the organs according to a protocolized schedule. Organ retrieval surgery was uneventful. The heart recipient was a 60-y-old male individual, with a recent history of coronary artery disease who had suffered acute coronary syndrome followed by cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular rupture. He was placed on the waiting list as a code 0 patient and received a heart transplant on the sixth d, with a cold ischemia time of 6 h and 100 minutes on an extracorporeal pump. He was discharged from the ICU to the general ward on postoperative d 6 and discharged 9 d later. He presented some infectious complications in the follow-up, mainly cytomegalovirus pneumonia and a Stenotrophomonas maltophilia urinary infection, with a favorable outcome after admittance to the ICU. Evolution was then uneventful, and no complication was subsequently reported. One y after transplantation, he underwent coronarography, and the result was normal. The pancreas and left kidney were transplanted to a 30-y-old female individual, with type 1 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, and bad metabolic control, with dialysis treatment initiated 3 y and 19 d earlier. She spent 14 mo and 16 d on the waiting list. After receiving her double organ transplant (left kidney and pancreas), both grafts showed adequate function on the first postoperative d, and she was discharged on postoperative d 14. The plasma creatinine level was 1.01 mg/dL upon discharge and 1.2 mg/dL 1 y after transplantation with a full metabolic recovery. The right kidney was transplanted to a 26-y-old female individual, with IgA nephropathy, with dialysis treatment initiated 3 y, 11 mo, and 25 d earlier. The right kidney of the donor was transplanted to the left side of the recipient. Adequate graft function was confirmed in the operating theater as urine output started by the end of surgery. She had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative d 13 with a plasma creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. One y later, her plasma creatinine level was 1 mg/dL. DISCUSSION The popularity of e-cigarettes has increased since their commercialization; the reports of liquid nicotine intoxication, both accidental and voluntary as suicide attempts, have become more and more frequent, given the wide availability of e-liquids containing highly concentrated nicotine. The most frequent symptoms are nausea, vomiting, agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, headache, and altered mental status; higher doses of nicotine intoxication lead to severe tachycardia and arrhythmias, seizures, acute hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, cardiovascular collapse, and cardiac arrest.2-6 Because no specific antidote is available, the appropriate treatment is cardiopulmonary support in the ICU. The most frequent cause of death after nicotine intoxication is related to cardiac events, though acute cerebral pathology cannot be excluded. The actual lethal dose of nicotine is unknown; after oral ingestion, nicotine is absorbed and quickly metabolized by the liver into its inactive metabolites, the most stable and abundant of which is cotinine. Due to short half-life of nicotine (2–3 h), levels of cotinine concentration are frequently used as a surrogate marker of nicotine intoxication levels. Despite the high toxicity of a nicotine overdose, we have documented a case of successful multiorgan donation, including kidneys, pancreas, and heart from a brain-dead donor after a lethal nicotine intoxication and successful resuscitation from a cardiorespiratory arrest. This appears to be the first case of multiorgan donation following liquid nicotine intoxication reported in the literature so far. In 2017, Räsänen et al7 reported a case of kidney donation after brain death caused by a subcutaneous nicotine overdose in an attempted suicide. The patient was a 29-y-old woman with a history of severe depression and obesity who subcutaneously injected 10 mL of liquid nicotine after an intake of alcohol and diazepam. She was taken to hospital, still conscious but anxious on admission. In the emergency department, she had seizures followed by cardiorespiratory arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and admitted to the ICU, where she experienced an unfavorable course and eventually brain death. She was accepted as a kidney donor resulting in 2 successful transplantations: 2 women, aged 39 and 43 y, both with diabetic nephropathy as the cause of their end-stage renal disease. Both had an uneventful postoperative recovery and were discharged on postoperative d 9. On their follow-up, both were doing well, with normal plasma creatinine levels. In our case, the liver was discarded for transplantation due to altered aminotransferases, hyperechoic texture on ultrasonography in addition to the fact that the liver is the organ responsible for high-dose nicotine metabolism. Kidneys and pancreas were accepted for transplantation after confirming adequate laboratory tests and echographic data. To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature on renal failure after a nicotine overdose. After being transplanted, both kidneys and pancreas started to function within the first few h; dialysis was unnecessary and good function of the kidneys was present in the follow-up 1 y later. Regarding the heart, the decision to transplant was supported by the optimal electrocardiographic and echocardiographic record, the lack of elevated enzymes, and the hemodynamic stability of the donor after brain death, although the recent event of cardiac arrest and resuscitation maneuvers were an issue to be considered. As previously mentioned, heart transplantation was successful, and the recipient was doing well in his 1-y follow-up. The shortage of organs for transplantation has led transplant teams to consider brain-dead patients after fatal intoxications as potential candidates for donation. There is a growing number of cases in the literature reporting acceptable outcomes of organ procuring and transplant, most of them published as isolated cases. Successful kidney transplants have been documented from brain-dead donors after insulin or carbamazepine intoxication.8 Organ procurement after carbon monoxide intoxication has been discouraged, but successful multiorgan transplants have been reported, and an absolute contraindication is no longer accepted.9,10 Regarding illicit drug intoxications leading to brain death, there is an increase in the number of such patients recruited for organ donation. Solid organs transplanted after cocaine-related death do not show a worse outcome than those from noncocaine users, with some issues regarding heart transplant.10 Similarly, posttransplant survival of opioid-intoxicated donor hearts and lungs is similar to that from nonintoxicated donors.11,12 Even when dealing with brain-dead donors after ingestion of toxic substances mainly metabolized by the liver as, for instance, ethylene glycol or brodifacoum, a rodenticide with a potent anticoagulant effect, good graft outcome and acceptable recipient survival have been reported in the literature. Liver biopsy, hemodialysis to accelerate toxic clearance, and verification of the absence of the toxic substance in blood samples are the suggested strategies to optimize results.13-15 Liquid nicotine is a widely available, increasingly popular, and insufficiently regulated substance. Attention should be paid to the potential lethal risk of liquid nicotine intoxication, and efforts should be made to devise more thorough surveillance and avoid such unfortunate events. In case of lethal nicotine intoxication, multiorgan retrieval for donation may be considered, bearing in mind the recommendation of measuring nicotine metabolites in blood samples or even undertaking donor liver biopsy before performing the procedure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Utilisation of tobacco is one of the most serious problems affecting human health worldwide, despite the fact that the early fatality caused by tobacco use are growing, regardless of the fact that it is avoidable tobacco consumption is very common, considerable resources have been allocated to this issue. On tobacco prevention, a range of strategies have been tested but the ratio of death due to tobacco and number of tobacco consumers is increasing day by day. Various impediments to tobacco quitting have been recognized, all of which contribute to the failure of various tobacco cessation programs and methodologies. Individuals in the India have attempted or considered quitting smoking at some point in their lives but ended in failure. Existing tobacco cessation programs have not out-turned in a decrease in the figure of tobacco users or deaths, necessitating a new strategy. Tobacco cessation on prescription, developed from physical activity on prescription (PAP), can be a useful method in terms of public health. But yet no studies have ever been conducted over this. Further studies on this can explore results of tobacco quitting after prescription from general physician or other medical practitioner, evaluative beliefs about tobacco consumption and barriers in quitting even after prescription. Hence the present review was done with explore the outcomes for cessation of tobacco based upon utilization of tobacco cessation by prescription (TCP) methodology in Indian scenario. This review paper focuses on TCP as a need for newer approach pertaining to Indian perspective. Future study should look at whether raising the rate of stop attempts are improving the tobacco cessation rate in the general population after the implementation of TCP.",

Bupropion extended-release tablets, marketed as Zyban for adult smoking cessation, appears to have benefits for younger smokers, but rapid relapse is a significant drawback, according to a new study in the November 2007 Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine.A total of 312 adolescents aged 14 to 17 who smoked at least six cigarettes per day and had attempted to quit at least twice were recruited to participate. More than half (58 percent) were boys. They were randomly assigned, in equal ratio, to receive placebo, bupropion 150 mg/day, or bupropion 300 mg/day for one week before and six weeks after a designated quit date. These participants returned to the clinic once a week to receive a brief counseling session to encourage them to maintain the abstinence.Efficacy was measured by self-reported abstinence using a questionnaire, and the reports were confirmed by two different biochemical methods: exhaled carbon monoxide level weekly and cotinine levels in urine at the week 2 and week 6 visits. After weekly visits for about eight weeks, the study staff conducted two more assessments three months and six months after the initial quit date to see how many participants stayed off cigarettes.Six weeks after the initial quit date, the abstinence rates (defined as percentage of participants not smoking in the past seven days) as confirmed by cotinine were 5.6 percent, 10.7 percent, and 14.5 percent in the placebo, bupropion 150 mg/day, and 300 mg/day groups, respectively. Participants on bupropion 300 mg/day saw a modest but statistically significantly higher quit rate than placebo at weeks 1, 3, and 5 and 6 (see graph).The quit rate in the bupropion 150 mg/day group was not significantly different from that of the placebo group. As soon as the medication was stopped at the end of week 6, however, many participants relapsed, so that the quit rates at week 7 were no longer significantly different across all three groups.\"We found that there did seem to be an effect with medication treatment for smoking cessation, but it didn't last after the medication was stopped,\" Myra Muramoto, M.D., M.P.H., the lead author of the study told Psychiatric News. Muramoto is an associate professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.The study was funded by the National Cancer Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and GlaxoSmithKline.A previous study by Eric Moolchan, M.D., and colleagues reported a higher rate of smoking cessation after using nicotine patches and gums for 12 weeks, compared with placebo patches and gums, in a study in 13- to 17-year-old adolescents. \"Combined with Dr. Moolchan's study findings, our results show that pharmacotherapy can be useful for younger smokers,\" said Muramoto.The researchers found notable discrepancies among self-report, exhaled carbon monoxide levels, and urinary cotinine levels. \"Adolescents are known to be less reliable in reporting compliance,\" said Muramoto.\" Cotinine is more accurate because of its longer half-life [compared with exhaled carbon monoxide], especially for low-level smokers.\"How to help young people stop smoking is a poorly understood and often overlooked area in medicine and public health. The modest effectiveness and high relapse rates in this study illustrate the difficulty in treating nicotine addiction in young people. \"A message to clinicians is that, just because adolescents generally have a lower level of smoking [compared with adults], it doesn't mean they have an easier time quitting,\" Muramoto said.Early intervention, however, is important. Most adult long-term smokers acquired the habit in adolescence, and 23 percent of high school students are smokers, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data and a 1994 surgeon general's report. In a commentary published in the November 14, 2007 Journal of the American Medical Association, Suzanne Colby, Ph.D., and Chad Gwaltney Ph.D., concurred with the authors of this study that adolescent smoking cessation research is still in its infancy. They pointed out that smoking cessation efforts in adolescents pose unique challenges and should not be handled in the same way as smoking research and treatment in adults.\"Pharmacotherapies designed and approved for adults simply may not work as well for adolescents...[and] the mechanisms underlying smoking may not be the same for adolescents and adults,\" they wrote. \"Even basic questions about the severity and time course of nicotine withdrawal are not well understood.\"\"A physician can't just write a prescription and tell a patient to quit smoking. Behavioral support is critical for smoking cessation and has been used for a long time before any pharmacologic treatment became available,\" Muramoto emphasized. In this study, brief counseling was provided weekly along with assessments during the study and had some effects on abstinence even in the placebo group. She recommended psychosocial interventions as an important part of smoking cessation treatment for adults as well as youths. \"Coaching really works,\" she said.An abstract of \"Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of 2 Dosages of Sustained-Release Bupropion for Adolescent Smoking Cessation\" is posted at<http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/11/1068>.▪ ISSUES NewArchived",

In this situation it is proposed to proceed by steps, diminishing gradually the number of smoked cigarettes with the help of nicotine containing preparations. The patient tries to avoid the cigarette by boosting his serum nicotine level with the inhaler or the nicotine gum as often as possible and seeks to understand the reasons why he is a smoker.

      "abstract": "Eleven obese women progressively increased periods of walking each day for one year or longer while no dietary restriction was imposed. No weight loss occurred until walking exceeded 30 minutes daily. Generally, weight loss paralleled length of time spent walking. When a certain amount of walking was maintained and weight stabilized at a lower level, more weight loss occurred when walking was increased. Weight loss was slow and proceeded at a rate much less than anticipated if no compensatory increase in food intake had occurred. A marked decrease in skinfold thickness over the upper part of the arm occurred, suggesting that loss of fat accounted for most, if not all, of the weight loss.",

Caffeine is pervasive in our beverages, foods, and medicines. Americans may find it difficult, even impossible, to completely eliminate from their diets. Caffeine is a natural ingredient in coffees, chocolates, and teas. It is intentionally added to products ranging from sodas, sports drinks, performance dietary supplements, alcoholic beverages, headache medicines, and even drinking water. Routine, extensive ingestion of America's favorite drug reflects our societal acquiescence in addiction. A caffeine high is an innocent pleasure that millions undertake one or more times each day to stimulate their minds and bodies to perform at peak levels. Caffeine provides a daily, inexpensive boost of energy that makes life better for many Americans, regardless of their social class, ethnicity, or status.",

The inconsistent and often contradictory results within any subject in coffee/caffeine and health research leads to further confusion, while the stimulatory effects of caffeine are subject to considerable inter‐individual variation, affecting personal attitudes (whether positive or negative) towards caffeinated beverages. Assessing individual research studies on their own merit, and putting into perspective the overall data on a number of health topics, from cardiovascular disease to cancer, does suggest that the health risks of moderate coffee or caffeine consumption are not as great as may have been assumed.

However, it is important to note that problem drinking rarely occurs in isolation from abuse of other drugs. For people dependent upon alcohol, tobacco is one of the mostly commonly coabused substances. Recent research suggests that individuals with alcohol dependency may gravitate toward tobacco use, in part, because of the positive effects of nicotine on aspects of cognitive performance that may be compromised as a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse. In this article, the author focuses on the effects of nicotine on behavioral and electrophysiological indexes of cognitive performance, and the impact of these effects on alcohol-related cognitive decrements. The author discusses implications of these findings in the context of treatment and recovery of people with alcoholism. Keywords: alcoholismcognitiontobacco use",

      "abstract": "Although many Americans dismiss alcohol because it is a legal substance, alcohol is in fact one of the most widely used and abused in our society. As many people know from personal experience, alcohol addiction wrecks marriages, stalls careers, tears apart families, and sometimes even kills. In addition, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) contends that many innocent people lose their lives each year because of drunk drivers. Hostetler (1991) stated, Research has shown that nearly all persons who have become drug-dependent can identify several that they first used. With the exception of those who became drug-dependent due to prescription drugs, the majority of drug-dependent persons point to tobacco products and beverage alcohol as their first used drugs (p. 4). As a result, there is an increasing need to educate young people about alcohol and its effects, to encourage them to seek other means of fun, and to foster in them a sense of responsibility as adults to use alcohol wisely, if not sparingly. Middle school years are a time of great change both physically and emotionally for most young people. They are often seeking to discover who they are and what they stand for. They may begin to question beliefs and standards that they have been brought up with, so that they can understand why they do the things they do (U.S. Department of Education, 1988). Peer pressure is also tremendous during these years. Most young people begin to shift their focus from the inside family world, to the more external world of their peers. Nearly 35% of fourth graders think that drinking is a significant concern in their schools; also, 4 of 10 sixth graders claim that there is peer pressure to consume alcoholic beverages (Hostetler, 1991; U.S. Department of Education, 1988). Because of this pressure, students often need an informal and independent means to discover their own beliefs and values. The idea behind the creation of DINOS (Drinking Is Not Our Solution) software was to develop a tool that would provide both counselors and",

      "abstract": "SAMMENDRAGDen negative sammenhengen mellom røyking og Parkinsons sykdom i epidemiologiske studier er robust.Det er prosentvis færre røykere og eks-røykere blant Parkinson-pasienter enn blant kontrollpersoner.Videre har røykere en lavere insidens og en lavere dødelighet enn andre av Parkinsons sykdom. Det er etåpent spørsmål om dette skyldes en beskyttende virkning av nikotin eller andre stoffer i tobakksrøyk somhydrazin eller karbonmonoksid, eller om det skyldes andre, underliggende faktorer. De mest aktuelle slikefaktorer er (1) selektiv dødelighet, altså at mange røykere ikke overlever lenge nok til å utvikleParkinsons sykdom, og (2) at personer som utvikler Parkinsons sykdom ofte har karaktertrekk som gjørdet mindre sannsynlig at de begynner å røyke. Det vitenskapelige grunnlaget er i alle fall for tynt for åanbefale røyking som et forebyggende virkemiddel mot Parkinsons sykdom. Og selv om det skulle viseseg at røyking virkelig beskytter mot sykdommen, veier de negative helsevirkningene av røyking myetyngre i folkehelsesammenheng. Allikevel bør denne assosiasjonen forfølges videre, ikke minst forpotensialet for en bedret forståelse av de underliggende patofysiologiske mekanismene bak sykdommen.Flaten TP. Does smoking protect against Parkinson’s disease? Nor J Epidemiol 1995; 5 (2): 145-150. ENGLISH SUMMARYIt is epidemiologically well established that Parkinson's disease is about twice as common among nonsmokers as among smokers. Whether this is due to a protective effect of nicotine or other compounds in cigarette smoke like hydrazine or carbon monoxide, or whether it is due to some other, confounding factor(s), remains to be established. The most relevant confounding factors are (1) selective mortality, that is, many smokers do not survive long enough to develop Parkinson's disease, and (2) that persons who eventually develop Parkinson's disease tend to have a preclinical personality type that makes them less likely to pick up the smoking habit. In any case, the scientific basis is not strong enough to recommend smoking as a preventive strategy in Parkinson's disease. And even if it were clearly demonstrated that smoking protects against the disease, the known adverse effects of smoking are so serious that any beneficial effects on Parkinson's disease could not possibly compensate for this hazard. However, unraveling the mechanism behind the reduced risk of Parkinson's disease in smokers may provide clues to an improved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the disease.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco has been used orally alone or in combination with other ingredients. In India tobacco is taken in several forms. Use of smokeless tobacco indeed represents a health concern of growing magnitude among these groups. As a consequence of its addictive qualities, the consumption of smokeless tobacco often becomes a lifelong habit with cumulative and deleterious effects on health. Smokeless tobacco has been advocated as a substitute for cigarette smoking. On the contrary, the use of smokeless tobacco is fraught with health risk and needs to be discouraged. Previous reports have described long term harmful effects of nicotine on various body parameters, little is known about acute effect of smokeless tobacco on cardiopulmonary parameters. Very few studies have been undertaken on the acute effect of use of Gutkha, a common form of smokeless tobacco in India on cardiopulmonary parameters of youngsters. Methods: Treadmill Exercise Testing & Pulmonary Function Tests were done before and after maximal exercise testing to assess cardiopulmonary efficiency in two groups’ viz., healthy sedentary controls and healthy gutkha chewers. Results: On studying the differences in cardiopulmonary efficiency in the two groups the resting heart rate was found to be statistically significantly higher in the study group and the delta heart rate was found to be statistically significantly lower among gutkha chewers. There was no significant difference seen in parameters like VO2 max, maximum oxygen pulse, MVV, VE max as an acute effect of gutkha chewing. Conclusion: In this study it appears that tobacco chewers are physically fit like controls, but after immediate tobacco chewing a lesser delta HR suggests a higher risk for cardiovascular mortality. Stopping tobacco chewing at this juncture can be helpful in reverting back the risk and parameters like resting HR, recovery HR, and delta HR can be used as prognostic assessment tools for any intervention therapy to stop gutkha chewing in asymptomatic individuals.",

      "abstract": "Information on the adverse effects of cannabis has accrued over the past few decades in a piecemeal fashion. Unfortunately, systematic, well-conducted research on the toxicology of the drug in humans is comparatively rare. In most cases, animal studies are of dubious relevance to human toxicology, and this review concentrates almost exclusively on investigations involving humans. Most information has come from small scale investigations, case reports and anecdotal evidence. Many studies assume that the adverse effects of smoking cannabis and the adverse effects of oral or intravenous delta-9tetrahydrocannabinol or THC (the main psychoactive constituent) are equivalent. This is not necessarily correct since, as discussed in other chapters, there are many other cannabinoids present in the plant. In addition, certain adverse effects of cannabis may depend upon the route of administration. Smoking gives rise to very rapid, and high, plasma and CNS levels of THC. This, for example, produces a different quality of psychoactive effect to that produced by oral administration which has a slow onset, but provides more sustained plasma levels of THC. Smoked cannabis produces adverse effects upon the lungs which do not occur when THC is given orally.",

Chronic and moderate alcohol consumption (i.e. 20-40 g/day) plus a high fat intake (i.e. > 40% of energy intake) favor a positive energy balance and thus weight gain. By contrast a high alcohol intake (i.e. > 20% of energy intake) may lead to malnutrition depending on the concomitant nutrient intake. It is evident that alcohol cannot be considered as an \"empty\" calorie. Energy wasting mechanisms, which have been proposed by some authors, are unlikely to contribute to energy balance in healthy subjects. Our present knowledge on the energetic value of alcohol mainly depend on physiologic data based on the measurements of energy and substrate balances. By contrast epidemiologic data on the effect of alcohol intake on body weight are contradictory. This is explained by the limitations of epidemiological studies as well as by the possible contributions of other life style-related factors. It is evident that many studies on the effect of alcohol on body weight are uncontrolled studies. It is surprising that although 100 years of research have gone in this area we still have no definite answer to the question.",

Thus, most adult users are current or former smokers who use e-cigarettes to reduce or quit cigarette smoking. Switching completely from cigarettes to e-cigarettes is associated with reduced toxicant exposure and reduced short-term respiratory symptoms; however, long-term health effects of e-cigarettes are unknown. Although a recent randomized trial suggests that e-cigarettes may promote smoking cessation, systematic reviews have had low certainty of evidence regarding cessation. e-Cigarettes pose several potential health risks, including exposure to heavy metals and toxicants, and nicotine poisoning. e-Cigarettes are also popular among youth, with rates of e-cigarette use surpassing those of cigarette use in this population. Youth e-cigarette use is associated with increased risk of subsequent cigarette and marijuana use. Screening for e-cigarette use in youth and adults, including pregnant women, in conjunction with screening for tobacco use, is advised. Education and interventions to prevent e-cigarette use should be provided to all youth. Youth should be counseled to stop using nicotine/tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Although the impact of e-cigarette use in pregnancy is unknown, nicotine is a teratogen; thus, pregnant women should be counseled to abstain from using all nicotine/tobacco products.",

Childhood is a critical period for experimenting with tobacco use and becoming addicted to nicotine. The tobacco industry has long targeted youths with aggressive marketing strategies to assure that its customer base is maintained. While smoking has declined among adolescents in many countries, the rate of decline has slowed. Tobacco smoking has adverse effects that extend across the entire life span, beginning before conception and ending with old age and death. Exposures in early life to tobacco smoke may have long-term implications for health across the life span.",

      "abstract": "Based mainly on the materials of Dagestan history, the paper addresses the issue of traditions of alcoholic beverages consumption, a subject that has not yet been studied. Originally, Islam is known to have urged its followers to limit the consumption of wine and other alcoholic beverages. Later, however, it introduced a prohibition thereon. With the development of alcohol-distillation technology and the rise in the consumption of strong alcoholic drinks, the struggle gained momentum but the prohibition turned out to be hard to implement. In medieval Dagestan, the clergy were tolerant to alcohol consumption. It was in the days of Imam Shamil and the reislamisation time period (late 20th – early 21st century) when they began to talk about the canons of Islam and alcohol prohibition. At that time the clergy in the rural communities of Dagestan prohibited the sales and consumption of alcohol. The state also limited alcohol consumption by means of “dry laws”. Today, it is public knowledge that excessive consumption of alcohol is harmful and even dangerous to health. Society should seek to limit thereof through democratic (promoting healthy life-style, restricting child access to alcohol), rather than prohibitive (state or Sharia dry laws) measures.",

De hecho, casi todas las culturas disponen de una droga que acompana sus rituales sociales, religiosos, o ambos. El ejemplo mas cercano se nos presenta en la transformacion del vino en la liturgia catolica. El consumo de drogas viene condicionado por la interacion individuo/ambiente, con toda su complicidad cultural, educativa, consumista, etc. Su prevencion es, por tanto, de enorme complejidad y supone una confluencia de esfuerzos entre las diferentes estructuras sociales, que van desde procedimientos legales hasta programas educativos, campanas de consumo, marketing, reestructuracion de la economia, educacion sanitaria y procedimientos individuales de tratamiento y rehabilitacion. Este trabajo hace especial hincapie en los procedimientos psicologicos que deberian formar parte o tomarse en consideracion en los programas educativos y de rehabilitacion dirigidos a la labor preventiva. EnglishProbably, human drug consumption is as old as humanity. In fact, almost all cultures dispose of some drug to accompany their social and/or religious rites, the closest example we have is the transformation of wine in the Catholic Liturgy. Drugs consumption is conditioned by the individual�s interaction with the environment, in all its educational, cultural and consumer complexity. So, its prevention is enormously complex and supposes a confluence of forces between different social structures, that include legal proceedings to educational programs, consumer campaigns, marketing, economy restructuration, health education and treatment and rehabilitation individual programs. This paper enphasizes the psychological steps that must be a part of those educational and rehabilitation programs directed towards a preventive labor.",

En la decada de los anos 90 se produjo una transformacion en las pautas de consumo de drogas respecto a la decada anterior. Hace diez o quince anos la sustancia predominante era la heroina y, aunque hoy en dia la proporcion de personas que la consumen en muy inferior a la de la cocaina, se puede afirmar que, sin que ambas dejen de estar presentes en el mundo de la drogadiccion, estan siendo desplazadas por las drogas de sintesis, experimentandose un espectacular aumento del trafico y consumo de estas sustancias.\nEn los ultimos anos el analisis de pelo ha sufrido un notable incremento debido a su utilidad para detectar el consumo de drogas durante un largo periodo de tiempo (desde semanas hasta meses o anos), frente a la informacion obtenida de otras muestras biologicas, como la sangre o la orina, que esta limitada a un periodo de tiempo mucho mas corto. Por otra parte, los niveles de concentracion que se encuentran en el pelo, tanto para los cannabinoides como para las anfetaminas, son muy inferiores a los encontrados en otras muestras como la sangre o la orina, por lo que su deteccion requiere de una tecnica analitica con una gran sensibilidad como la cromatografia de gases/espectrometria de masas.\nEl objetivo de esta memoria es desarrollar metodos analiticos sensibles y reproducibles que permitan el analisis de los principales componentes del cannabis en la misma muestra de pelo (THC, CBD y CBN), asi como del principal metabolito del THC, el THC-COOH, cuya deteccion en el pelo se ha discutido por diversos investigadores.

Although we tend to remember the importance of taking care of ourselves when we feel ill, good health should be considered a long-term investment. A sedentary lifestyle, obesity, tobacco, consumption of alcohol and other substances, and stress, among others, are factors that negatively affect our cells, accelerating the deterioration of tissues in our body. Good health means staying active physically, intellectually and socially, as well as carrying out healthy and regular habits, including a balanced diet and varied physical exercise. Fortunately, control of these factors is in our hands. If we manage to transform healthy behaviours into habits, the effort to maintain them will be less and will be rewarded by the motivation and perceived benefits for health and quality of life.",

Since sport plays an important role in physical and mental education and in promoting international understanding and cooperation, the widespread use of doping products and methods has consequences not only on health of the athletes, but also upon the image of sport. Thus, doping in sports is forbidden for both ethical and medical reasons. Narcotics and analgesics, anabolic steroids, hormones, selective androgen receptor modulators are among the most frequently utilized substances. Although antidoping controls are becoming more rigorous, doping and, very importantly, masking doping methods are also advancing, and these are usually one step ahead of doping detection techniques. Depending on the sport practiced and the physical attributes it requires, the athletes will look for one or more of the following benefits of doping: recovering from an injury, increasing body recovery capacity after training, increasing muscle mass and strength, decreasing fat tissue, increasing endurance. Finally, when we look once again at a doping scandal, amazed at how much animosity against those caught can exist; the question is: is it really such a disaster as presented by the media or a silent truth under our eyes, but which many of us have refused to accept?",

One instance of setting poor examples occurs during the holiday season, when some parents, for their children to more actively participate in the festivities, give them nonalcoholic wine and beer while the parents imbibe the real thing. This behavior can give a child the impression from an early age that since Mom or Dad gave me a beverage like their own it must be acceptable.

These differences are because that women are not capable as men to metabolise alcohol. According to the scientific evidence, moderate consumption of beer seems to be accepted to maintain an adequate quality of the diet, as it provides vitamins B (vitamin B6, B12 and folates) and minerals (magnesium) among other nutrients, as well as poliphenols and complex carbohydrates. In terms of health, a moderate beer consumption may play a protective role at cardiovascular levels, associated with an enhanced lipid profile. It should be highlighted the possible beneficial effects of a moderate consumption of fermented beverages (such as beer) is associated with other factors, such as gender, age, as well as the pattern of consumption throughout life.Actualmente existe una gran controversia relativa a la falta de definición respecto a lo que se considera un consumo moderado de bebidas alcohólicas desde el punto de vista de la salud, ya que, a su vez, debería ser un consumo socialmente aceptado. Aunque no existe una definición universalmente consensuada de consumo moderado, se considera como tal la cantidad por debajo de 10-12 g de alcohol al día para mujeres y de no más de 20-24 g alcohol al día para hombres. Estas diferencias se deben a la menor capacidad de las mujeres para metabolizar el alcohol. De acuerdo con la evidencia científica, parece aceptarse que el consumo moderado de cerveza puede colaborar en mantener una adecuada calidad de la dieta, ya que aporta vitaminas del complejo B (vitamina B6, B12 y folatos) y minerales (magnesio), entre otros nutrientes, así como polifenoles y carbohidratos complejos. En referencia a la salud, se ha atribuido a la cerveza un papel protector a nivel cardiovascular, asociado a un mejor perfil lipídico. Todo ello podría indicar un papel protector a nivel cardiovascular. También es importante señalar que el posible efecto beneficioso de un consumo moderado de bebidas fermentadas (como la cerveza) está asociado a otros factores como el sexo, la edad y el patrón de consumo a lo largo de la vida.",

      "abstract": "The energy drinks have undergone exponential hikes over the last years worldwide, in adults, youth, and even children. Among its components can be found: caffeine, guarana, taurine, ging-Seng, L-carnitine, creatinine or glucuronolactone, citric acid and phosphoric acid, among others. A responsible and occasional consumption should not pose major problems, but this is not the case. The medical effects are usually caused by their abuse, like: headaches, palpitations, insomnia, sweating, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, gastroesophageal reflux, facial numbness, bloating, tremor, diarrhea and even addiction, among others. While in the dental level, specifically on the dental enamel, the most severe impact is the erosion and the lesser impact is tooth staining, which has not yet been fully investigated, also have been described the development of hypersensitivity. A timely prevention and diagnosis are essential to minimize the damage caused by prolonged use of these products. It is essential to avoid a possible trend or “fad” associated with mixing energy drinks and alcohol and even drugs, of which they are not fully known the possible risks that could potentially cause. Due to its exponential growth it is essential to have an updated knowledge about the consumption of these beverages. The high consumption of energy drinks maintained over time is associated with negative effects at the medical and dental level. Further research is necessary to prevent, treat and rehabilitate the consequences produced by the consumption of these products.",

He defines as problem drinkers persons who repeatedly use alcohol in amounts greater than \"customary dietary use or prevailing socially acceptable customs\"; or in amounts that lead to health problems, interfere with everyday relationships with others, or hamper fulfilling family, economic, and community expectations.1 The core of this definition has to do with use that is excessive in terms of prevailing customs or injuries to health or disruption of role relationships.",

      "abstract": "Dalam awal perkembangannya, narkotika, psikotoprika, dan zat adiktif lainnya (NARKOBA) dikenal dan\r\ndipergunakan manusia untuk mengatasi berbagai masalah terutama untuk kepentingan kesehatan dan sosial. Hanya saja\r\nselain dari pengaruh positifnya, bahan-bahan ini juga banyak mengandung pengaruh negatif yang sangat membahayakan\r\nbagi kelangsungan hidup manusia. Pada masa ini narkotika tidak saja dipergunakan sebagai bahan-bahan untuk\r\nmenunjang kesehatan namun dipergunakan untuk tujuan lain yaitu untuk menimbulkan rasa senang, tenang, tenteram,\r\nberani, kuat juga hebat bagi penggunanya. Polisi selaku penyidik supaya melakukan tindakan tegas kepada para\r\npenyelundup, pembuat narkoba, pengedar untuk menerapkan ancaman hukuman tertinggi dalam Undang-Undang\r\nNarkoba. Akan tetapi dengan tugas dan tanggung jawab yang seperti itu, justru Polri sebagai penegak hukum juga ikut\r\nserta mengkonsumsi narkotika tersebut. Hal ini dapat dibuktikan berdasarkan data tahunan penyalahgunaan narkotika\r\noleh Polri di Polresta Kota Padang, membuktikan tingkat penyalahgunaan narkotika yang dilakukan oleh anggota Polri\r\nselalu ada tiap tahunnya. Hal ini patut dipertanyakan, mengapa anggota Polri tersebut bisa ikut serta dalam\r\npenyalahgunaan narkotika sedangkan dia merupakan aparat penegak hukum. Polri yang melakukan penyalahgunaan\r\nnarkotika tersebut khususnya pemakai juga dijerat dalam UU. No 35 Tahun 2009 tentang narkotika dalam Pasal 111 dan\r\n112, dan Polri tersebut juga akan mendapatkan sanksi profesi yang terdapat dalam Peraturan Kepala Kepolisian Negara\r\nRepublik Indonesia NO. POL. : 7 Tahun 2006. Penelitian dilakukan di Polresta Kota Padang yang bertujuan untuk: a)\r\nmengetahui apakah faktor yang melandasi terjadinya penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri, b) mengetahui\r\nbagaimana upaya penanggulangan dari tindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika yang dilakukan oleh anggota Polri, c)\r\nmengetahui kendala-kendala yang dihadapi dalam menanggulangi terjadinya tindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika\r\noleh anggota Polri. Dalam penelitian ini digunakan metode yuridis sosiologis dengan spesifikasi pembahasannya yaitu\r\ndeskriptif, teknik pengumpulan datanya studi dokumen dan penelitian lapangan melalui wawancara, kemudian dianalisis\r\nsecara kualitatif. Dari hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan bahwa faktor penyebab terjadinya tindak pidana\r\npenyalahgunaan narktika oleh anggota Polri adalah: a) faktor individu, faktor ini terdapat dalam pribadi anggota Polri\r\nsendiri yang meliputi emosi dan rasa penasaran terhadap narkotika, b) faktor lingkungan, terdapat dalam lingkungan\r\nPolri yang sering berhadapan dengan narkotika sehingga anggota Polri sulit untuk menghindari keinginan untuk\r\nmencoba barang haram tersebut. Upaya penanggulangan penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh Polri dilakukan dengan: upaya\r\npreentif yaitu berupa himbauan/ teguran saja dan dalam upaya ini terdapat penerapan 2 program, upaya preventif\r\ndilakukan dengan penerapan 3 program, upaya represif yakni penindakan secara hukum semua jenis tindak pidana\r\npenyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri. Kendala yang dihadapi polisi dalam penerapan program penanggulangan\r\ntindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri terbagi dalam kendala internal dan kebndala eksternal.",

There are well over 8,000 compounds present in tobacco and tobacco smoke, but we do not know what effect, if any, many of them have on smokers. Major interest has been on nicotine, as well as on toxic and carcinogenic effects and several major and minor components of tobacco smoke responsible for the negative health effects of smoking have been elucidated. Smokers themselves report a variety of positive effects from smoking, including effects on depression, anxiety and mental acuity. Smoking has also been shown to have protective effects in Parkinson’s Disease. Are the subjective reports of a positive effect of smoking due to nicotine, of some other components of tobacco smoke, or are they a manifestation of the relief from nicotine withdrawal symptoms that smoking provides? This mini-review summarises what is currently known about the components of tobacco smoke with potential to have positive effects on smokers.",

      "abstract": "Very few of the man in the survey helped with the housework, shopping or cooking while most of the women did all their own work. Only 20 % of both men and women were helped by family or friends and very few of the subjects had home-helps or 'meals on wheels' or attended lunch clubs, day centres etc. More men than women go out nearly every day and men have more outside hobbies than women. Less than half the old people attended any clubs but the women were more likely to join clubs than men. A wide range of hobbies was given. Energy expenditure was calculated from activity diaries and values taken from Durnγn and Passmore. The average daily energy expenditure for all men (average age 70 years, mean height 167.2 cm, mean weight 68.2 kg) was 2,329 kcal and the average daily energy intake was 2,399 kcal. Energy expenditure decreased with age as did energy intake except for the over 80-year group who had a slightly higher calorie intake than the 70- to 79-year group. The average daily energy expenditure for all women (mean age 71 years, mean height 154.2 cm and mean weight 61.4 kg) was 1,943 kcal and the average daily energy intake was 1,733 kcal. It is thought that energy expenditure results may include an overestimation of energy expended at housework. Energy expenditure and energy intake decreased with age. The standard deviations for all results were large showing that there was a wide range of energy intake and energy expenditure in the survey. 4.107 men (average age 66.5 years) and 46 women (average age 65 years) were stillworking (on average 34 h/week for the men and 23 h/week for the women). Most of thewomen had part-time, sedentary or domestic jobs but a wide variety of occupations(mostly in the lower social groups) was found for the men. This made it difficult to assessenergy expenditure as it was not always possible to observe the subjects at work. However, it was estimated that the men expended on average 1,000 kcal/day at work while the womenexpended only 552 kcal/day.",

El centre d’atencio primaria de salut es un espai d’oportunitat per abordar el consum de tabac, ja que la majoria de persones el visiten com a minim un cop a l’any. No solament la dependencia a la nicotina es rao perque les persones tenen dificultats per deixar de fumar, sino que deixar de fumar es tambe una practica social fruit d’activitats reflexives de les persones, que tan emergeixen i reforcen el context ,i es des d’aqui que ens interessa comprendre de manera profunda com les persones donen sentit i interpreten deixar de fumar en el context sanitari. L’objectiu general d’aquesta tesi es descriure el proces de deixar de fumar en el context d’atencio primaria. Es tracta de captar aquest proces tenint en compte la complexitat d’aquest a traves dels aspectes seguents: la percepcio de risc sobre la conducta de fumar; els valors i les creences sobre la qual es construeix el proces de deixar de fumar; els diferents contextos en els quals es fuma; la diferencia de papers que te el professional de la salut i la persona que fuma dins el context sanitari i la utilitat de les intervencions professionals en els contextos de vida de les persones. A partir d’aqui s’han desenvolupat tres estudis des de la perspectiva de la sociologia comprensiva microsociologica. A continuacio es presenten els principals resultats: \r\nEstudi sobre la percepcio de risc que tenen les persones que fumen: El principal resultat d’aquest estudi es que la construccio de risc de fumar de les persones fumadores te un caracter multidimensional, interpretatiu i dinamic. \r\nEstudi sobre com s’organitza una intervencio per motivar a les persones a deixar de fumar: El principal resultat que es deriva d’aquest estudi es que el professional de la salut (sigui metge de familia o infermera) construeix diferents tipus de sessions d’entrevista motivacional, es mes, s’identifiquen accions comunicatives que provoquen que la conversa es centri en la persona o en el professional. En concret, les habilitats interpersonals del professional, l’us del llenguatge o com s’aplica el protocol de la sessio d’entrevista motivacional generen dos tipus de practiques diferents: la que he anomenat “practica centrada en el pacient” contra “practica centrada en el problema”.\r\nEstudi sobre el proces de deixar de fumar assistit pel professional de la salut: L’estudi aporta un model explicatiu on el proces de deixar de fumar assistit pel professional de la salut es un proces d’aprenentatge i interpretatiu, on les creences i els contextos tenen un paper clau que podrien explicar l’exit o el fracas de l’intent de deixar de fumar. A mes, es un proces que es construeix en el marc del coneixement expert del professional i s’aborda com un problema de salut, amb els seus signes i simptomes i tractament. Consequencies d’aquest abordatge, l’estudi aporta que deixar de fumar en la consulta d’atencio primaria es pot explicar com una practica de medicalitzacio de la conducta de fumar.",

      "title": "Role of physical activity in regulating appetite and body fat",
      "abstract": "Abstract Recent articles in the press have questioned the role of physical activity in regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight. These articles can be confusing and misleading for the public. Yet this is a complex area and there is disagreement about the importance of physical activity even among academics. Uncertainty and misunderstanding in this area may be related to the heterogeneity of the term ‘physical activity’, which encompasses sporting pursuits with extremely high levels of energy expenditure over prolonged periods of time, as well as everyday tasks involving much lower levels of energy expenditure on an intermittent basis. This latter form of physical activity includes what has been termed ‘non‐exercise activity thermogenesis’. In the right circumstances, physical activity can make a major contribution to the maintenance of a healthy weight even in the absence of dietary control although a combination of the two is almost certain to be more effective. In the long‐term, evidence suggests that for most people exercise is likely to lead to only modest weight loss. This may be due to an insufficient amount of physical activity being performed together with compensatory changes in eating and exercise behaviours. This is hard to prove because energy intake and energy expenditure are difficult to quantify in free‐living situations. Individual differences in the way people respond to exercise due to both environmental ( e.g . social class, education level, income, eating and exercise behaviours of family and peers, weather) and genetic factors also contribute to uncertainty about the effectiveness of physical activity for weight control. Nevertheless, physical activity remains a vital component of a healthy lifestyle due to its positive influence on energy balance as well as its potential to reduce the risk of lifestyle‐related diseases.",

      "abstract": "O presente artigo teve como objetivo analisar a produção científica sobre os danos à saúde causados em decorrência do uso do cigarro eletrônico (CE). Os CE surgiram como alternativa ao tabagismo e, embora proibidos no Brasil, são amplamente utilizados, especialmente entre jovens. Esses dispositivos vaporizam uma solução contendo nicotina, aromatizantes e outras substâncias químicas que podem causar danos à saúde. Estudos indicam que o uso desses dispositivos pode causar problemas pulmonares, como a lesão pulmonar associada ao vaping (EVALI), doenças respiratórias crônicas e danos cardiovasculares, incluindo infarto do miocárdio e disfunções endoteliais. Além disso, os CE estão associados a problemas gastrointestinais, como refluxo e alterações da microbiota intestinal, além de doenças bucais. A exposição prolongada à nicotina também pode prejudicar a saúde mental, especialmente em adolescentes, aumentando o risco de dependência, ansiedade e depressão. Embora alguns tratamentos, como a terapia de reposição de nicotina e medicamentos possam ajudar na cessação do uso, ainda são necessárias mais pesquisas sobre a eficácia dessas abordagens no contexto do CE. Assim, a regulação e a educação são essenciais para mitigar os danos causados por esses dispositivos.",

      "abstract": "Purpose – With reference to the long-term struggle to confirm cigarette smoking as a manifestation of nicotine addiction, this chapter explores the extent to which new understandings of addictions as ‘appetitive disorders’ rather than ‘dependence disorders’ derive from treatment technology development as well as advances in basic scientific research.Approach – Through historical analysis it is discussed how cigarette smoking only became widely accepted as a real drug problem in the 1980s after it had been shown to be amenable to treatment as such through the use of novel nicotine replacement therapies.Findings – These replacement therapies succeeded in showing that the same drug that drew users into addiction could be redeployed to help draw up them out of it. Nicorette® could serve as at least the partial antidote to nico-wrong (cigarettes). However, as relapse to smoking has remained the most likely outcome of any smoking cessation attempt, so medicinal nicotine has also served to demonstrate that nicotine addiction is ultimately a problem of an uncontrollable appetite for cigarettes in excess of drug dependence.Implications – Pharmaceutical incursion on cigarette smoking commencing in the late 1970s pointed to the need for a new mental disease model of drug-related problems while also providing valuable new tools and insights for ensuing brain research.",

      "title": "How to help your patients lose weight: Current therapy for obesity",
      "abstract": "Obesity is epidemic and dangerous. Weight loss is difficult but worth the effort. Although new weight-loss drugs are available, there are no magic bullets: to lose weight and keep it off, people must eat less and exercise more. This article presents a practical approach on how physicians can help their patients lose weight through diet, behavior modification, and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy. An appropriate initial goal is to lose 5% to 10% of one's baseline weight over 3 to 6 months. Drug therapy should not be used in isolation, but it can be an adjunct to diet, exercise, and behavior modification if a patient is committed and able to make necessary changes in eating and activity, and if the patient has a BMI of 30 or higher or a BMI greater than 27 with weight-related comorbid conditions. Anorectic therapy is unlikely to succeed and should be stopped if the patient does not lose at least 4 lb in the first 4 weeks of therapy. Orlistat is unlikely to be of benefit if patients do not lose at least 3% of their baseline weight by 12 weeks. Because obesity is a chronic disease, drug treatment should be continued indefinitely. The physician and patient must understand the intention to treat long-term. The weight loss plan devised should improve upon previous plans: for example, implementing a regular, convenient exercise program that had not been included in the past, or offering pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Women with eating disorders sometimes smoke to control their weight. This study examined the relative contributions of the range of factors that motivate smoking in women with eating disorders. Twenty-five women with anorexia nervosa and 16 women with bulimia nervosa were compared with 21 women with a depressive mood disorder. Each completed measures of current and lifetime prevalence of smoking, motivation to smoke and dependence on smoking. Smoking was less prevalent in anorexia nervosa than in bulimia nervosa or in mood disorders. Although the eating-disordered women had a higher motivation to smoke for weight control than the mood-disordered group, overall motivation to smoke was higher in the eating-disordered women. Their strongest motivator for smoking was coping with stress. The eating-disordered women showed similar levels of dependence on smoking to the mood-disordered group, but tended to have a lower desire to give up smoking. Clinical interventions for women with eating disorders who smoke might be targeted at helping them cope with stress, as well as viewing their smoking as a method of weight control. Assessment of women with eating disorders should address the use of nicotine and motivations for its use, to help identify targets for intervention.

This chapter considers evidence about regrets, addictions, and attempts to quit or otherwise reverse unhealthy behaviour. The evidence gives strong support for thinking that paternalistically regulating smoking can, in principle, make people better off. But the evidence is much weaker when it comes to alcohol and fattening food and drink. In part, the reason is an absence of evidence. Although researchers have studied the effects of regulations on behaviour and the effects of behaviour on health, they have not done much to connect people’s health to their ultimate preferences. Insofar as we have evidence, it implies that only relatively few eaters and drinkers (whether of alcohol or sugary drinks) make mistakes about their interests. Even if this observation is correct, the paternalistic case for regulation is not lost. But it is in trouble.",

      "abstract": "Le sucre et les edulcorants tiennent aujourd’hui une place importante dans notre regime alimentaire. Biologiquement, l’homme eprouve un attrait inne pour les saveurs sucrees. La consommation de sucre mobilise les memes neurotransmetteurs du plaisir, a savoir la dopamine, dans des zones cerebrales similaires a celles activees par des substances psychoactives. Le statut du sucre est donc ambivalent car il est a meme de declencher des troubles du comportement alimentaire. En effet, la publicite et le « neuromarketing » industriel influencent et guident les consommations individuelles. De par la chronicite et la repetition de tels comportements, un usage simple peut progressivement devenir abusif, par un mecanisme ressemblant a celui de l’addiction telle qu’elle est definie dans le DSM IV. Le sondage realise sur la base des criteres scientifiques diagnostiques (tolerance, sevrage, « craving ») relate les resultats obtenus dans la discussion de cette these. Ces habitudes peuvent a terme entrainer des pathologies metaboliques invalidantes telles que l’obesite et le diabete. Elles exposent egalement a une perte du mecanisme de faim-satiete, ainsi qu’a une vulnerabilite favorisant le phenomene de restriction cognitive. Ces pathologies ont un cout economique, societal et humain contre lequel il est necessaire de lutter. Le pharmacien d’officine tient une place importante dans ce changement collectif. Celui-ci, de par son role de conseil preventif doit fournir aux patients des informations sur l’equilibre alimentaire ainsi que des regles hygieno-dietetiques promouvant une modification durable des comportements alimentaires nefastes. Grâce a une meilleure comprehension des besoins energetiques, une lecture eclairee des etiquetages alimentaires et l’education des enfants, il est possible de mettre en place une prise de conscience a l’echelle individuelle et collective.

      "title": "Food Addiction and Neuroimaging",
      "abstract": "Obesity has become a serious epidemic and one of the leading global health problems. However, much of the current debate has been fractious, and etiologies of obesity have been attributed to eating behavior (i.e. fast food consumption), personality, depression, addiction or genetics. One of the interesting new hypotheses for explaining the development of obesity involves a food addiction model, which suggests that food is not eaten as much for survival as pleasure and that hedonic overeating is relevant to both substance-related disorders and eating disorders. Accumulating evidence has shown that there are a number of shared neural and hormonal pathways as well as distinct differences in these pathways that may help researchers discover why certain individuals continue to overeat despite health and other consequences, and becomes more and more obese. Functional neuroimaging studies have further revealed that pleasant smelling, looking, and tasting food has reinforcing characteristics similar to drugs of abuse. Many of the brain changes reported for hedonic eating and obesity are also seen in various types of addictions. Most importantly, overeating and obesity may have an acquired drive similar to drug addiction with respect to motivation and incentive craving. In both cases, the desire and continued satisfaction occur after early and repeated exposure to stimuli. The acquired drive for eating food and relative weakness of the satiety signal would cause an imbalance between the drive and hunger/reward centers in the brain and their regulation. In the current paper, we first provide a summary of literature on food addition from eight different perspectives, and then we proposed a research paradigm that may allow screening of new pharmacological treatment on the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).",

Issues surrounding \"crack babies\" and adult children of alcoholics have been widely discussed in the popular media, and have been addressed by lawmakers, educators, and health practitioners around the country. Although scientific evidence on this topic clearly lags behind public concern, a growing body of research data documents the ways parental substance abuse can reverberate throughout the lifespan of offspring. Until recently, most scientists have focused on the issue of whether parental substance abuse affects the development of children. They have asked questions about whether prenatal exposure to a particular drug is associated with a particular developmental problem: For example, is maternal crack use related to premature birth, does maternal alcoholism cause mental retardation, is maternal heroin abuse associated with attention deficits in school-age children, or are children raised by alcoholic parents likely to have drinking problems themselves? Although studies posing questions, such as these, have often found that prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse increases the likelihood that children will have developmental problems",

Las consecuencias de fumar cigarrillo van desde cambios fisiopatologicos en los sistemas respiratorio, cardiovascular y digestivo, hasta trastornos mentales asociados a la dependencia a la nicotina. Objetivo.  Realizar una revision narrativa de la literatura medica mostrando los efectos del consumo de cigarrillo sobre la salud fisica y mental en los fumadores activos y pasivos. Material y metodos.  El articulo se basa en la revision de articulos a traves de la base de datos del MEDLINE y de la biblioteca Virtual de la OMS. Se emplearon en la busqueda las palabras clave Cigarette Smoke, Cancer AND smoke, COPD AND smoke, Nicotine Dependence. Se escogieron articulos y libros publicados en idioma ingles entre los anos 1994 y 2006, realizando una lectura critica (analisis de posibles conflictos de interes y errores de diseno). Conclusion.  El humo del cigarrillo contiene particulas potencialmente peligrosas para la salud de quien esta expuesto a ellas. De este modo, fumar cigarrillo se convierte en un factor etiologico comun a muchos tipos de cancer. Ademas los componentes del cigarrillo estan relacionados con el desarrollo de otros estados patologicos (enfermedad cardiovascular y enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cronica). La nicotina, uno de sus componentes, es un potente agente adictivo. Todo esto en su conjunto hace del cigarrillo un importante problema de salud publica.",

This report attempts to fill this gap by describing two exceptionally dependent smokers. Both suffer with a smoking-related disease and have a very strong motivation to quit. Despite receiving intensive behavioural and pharmacological treatments to help them stop smoking, they have been unable to maintain even a short period of abstinence. The two cases provide reference examples for the assertion that while not all smokers are hopelessly hooked, some are. Such illustrative cases may stimulate research into the area of individual differences in cigarette dependence.",

      "abstract": "This literature review presents data on the effects of electronic cigarettes on the human body. The composition of vape liquid and the harm caused by each component separately, including glycerin, propylene glycol, is described. Vegetable glycerin is used for refueling electronic cigarettes, which determines the flavor. Propylene glycol is used to dissolve flavorings. The role of nicotine is more detailed than the other components, because among other things it is a neurotoxin and addictive. Literature sources have been analyzed to study the formation of pathological changes in tissues and organs during the use of electronic cigarettes. One of the first systems to be negatively affected by smoking is the respiratory system. Nicotine causes prolonged constriction of capillaries and arterioles, due to which normal gas exchange in the lungs is disturbed. Under the influence of nicotine is depressed activity of the nervous system. But the insidiousness of nicotine is not only that. Particularly dangerous to health long-term smoking. The brain gets used to the constant supply of nicotine. On the blood vessels nicotine has a spasmodic effect, promotes thrombosis. Diseases associated with the use of electronic delivery of nicotine, called EVALI, are presented, the latter meaning “lung injury associated with the use of electronic cigarettes”. The review emphasizes the negative effects of nicotine on the digestive system. Smoking contributes to narrowing of stomach vessels, gastric juice secretion is disturbed, and its composition changes, appetite decreases, peristalsis changes, and digestive diseases occur. To date, there is a growing trend in the number of people smoking electronic cigarettes, which is actively promoted by marketers [8]. They position smoking e-cigarettes as a fashion that does not cause harm to health. But this is a big misconception. E-smoking is virtually the same as regular smoking, except that e-cigarettes do not contain tar. The availability of vapes increases the trend of increasing use of these products by schoolchildren, which is a serious social problem.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is generally regarded as a form of nicotine dependence, but the evidence for this is slender. Two experiments are described here which examine the hypothesis that habitual smokers need nicotine and that they regulate their intakes of this drug. A laboratory test for smoking was devised which permitted the continuous monitoring of puffing as well as of selected physiologic variables; the procedure was also designed to reduce the influence of smoking habits and rituals. In the first experiment, inhaled amounts of tobacco smoke reduced subsequent ad libitum smoking in a dose-related way. In the second experiment comparable doses of nicotine were given intravenously to the same subjects, but they failed to affect ongoing smoking. However, both the inhaled and intravenous doses of the drug produced very similar physiologic effects. These experiments do not, therefore, support the nicotine-dependence hypothesis; thus the ways, if any, in which this drug sustains the tobacco-smoking habit merit further examination.",

      "title": "Tobacco harm reduction: The need for new products that can compete with cigarettes",
      "abstract": "Over the last 50 years, the concept of tobacco harm reduction has been well established. It is now understood that nicotine itself is not very harmful and nicotine replacement therapy products have been widely used as an aid to quit, reduce to quit or temporarily abstain from smoking for many years. The popularity of the unlicensed electronic cigarette has increased despite an unknown risk profile and sinus use in Sweden provides strong evidence in support of a harm reduction strategy. The regulatory environment around harm reduction has changed in the UK and is continuing to evolve across the globe. The need for more appealing, licensed nicotine products capable of competing with cigarettes sensorially, pharmacologically and behaviourally is considered by many to be the way forward. The significant positive impact on public health that could be gained from encouraging people to switch from cigarettes to licensed medicinal nicotine products cannot be ignored.",

      "title": "More food for thought: preferred words",
      "abstract": "In last month's editorial, I encouraged clinicians to include one additional sentence in their standard line of questions regarding appetite, essentially “have you ever eaten more than you intended?” followed up with “did you feel like it wasn't easy to stop?”1 This was based on the observation that many people with eating disorders, especially binge eating disorder (BED), are undiagnosed, resulting in their psychiatric and non-psychiatric comorbidities remaining suboptimally managed. In this issue of the International Journal of Clinical Practice, Lydecker et al.2 have gone several steps further and researched language preferences for discussing obesity and binge eating among over 800 people in an online community sample. Preferred obesity-related terms were “weight” and “BMI.” Binge-related terms were generally ranked neutrally and preferred descriptions were “kept eating even though not physically hungry and loss of control.” It was noted that discussions about weight and binge eating are very sensitive and that “conversations about weight and binge eating might create such distress that individuals would prefer not to discuss the topics at all.” Gender differences included women's stronger aversions to some terms, possibly related to more frequent experiences of weight stigmatisation than men or to greater sensitivity to potentially pejorative terms. The authors concluded that “healthcare providers are encouraged to practice sensitivity and display empathy during discussions of weight and weightloss counselling with female patients in particular.” What words to avoid? Rated as less desireable are terms such as “fatness” and “excess fat,” as well as “large size,” “heaviness,” and “obesity.” Also to be avoided are terms such as “willpower.” Additional obstacles to a comprehensive evaluation, as identified in a study of physician–patient conversations about BED,3 included the observations that psychiatrists focused on weight-related issues, whereas patients focused on the emotional impact and triggers of binge eating episodes, and that there is often miscommunication about the severity of binge eating episodes, as well as judgment, bias and shame surrounding BED. Lydecker et al. recommend that healthcare providers use more preferred terms when discussing obesity (weight) and binge eating (kept eating/not physically hungry and loss of control). Individual patients’ preferences when discussing sensitive topics including weight and binge eating will make themselves evident when the topic is introduced. A caveat is that the loss of control in binge-eating episodes can be a complex behaviour to understand and communicate. However, not bringing the topic up at all would be doing a disservice to our patients.

Performance was divided into four categories - sexual desire, sexual arousal, sexual satisfaction and orgasm.\r\n \r\nThe scientists looked at the effects the different drugs had on each category.\r\n \r\nThe study found that overall, the sexual performance of those using drugs was moderately to significantly impaired compared to those who did not use drugs.\r\n \r\nDifferent drugs had different effects on the various categories. For example, cocaine use did not usually affect sexual desire, but did affect sexual pleasure. Meanwhile, cocaine, heroin and alcohol all affected the ability to orgasm.\r\n \r\nWhen it came to sexual arousal, alcohol had the biggest detrimental affect. And this problem did not appear to resolve even if the men stopped drinking.

As a result, the disposition to experience these desires is very persistent over the long-term, manifesting itself in particular episodes of wanting to use drugs that recur with great frequency. Both the persistence and the recurrence of these desires, it is argued, contribute to a diminished ability to respond to relevant reasons that speak against drug use.",

Individuals who are susceptible to addiction include those who are increasingly exposed to the addictive agents. Nicotine use and abuse of alcohol are the most abused substances in the globe. These substances are responsible for the increasing mortality in both developing and developed worlds. The risk factors for addiction range from genetic factors to environmental factors. Alcohol dependence is mostly attributed to the short (S) allele. Similarly, this dependence is also linked to the environmental factors. Like alcohol, nicotine dependence is also linked to genetic factors. Various genetic studies indicate that nicotine dependence is heritable as there are many genes responsible for inheritance of smoking behavior. This study however notes that addiction to drugs is as a result of either heritable or inheritable factors. The study used 2000 smokers, 3000 alcohol addicts and 3000 cannabis dependents as the population for research. The researchers evaluated the contributions of genes to substance dependence. The results of the study showed that genetic and environmental factors contributed significantly to the addiction disorder.",

A más consumo de cannabis mayor consumo de otras drogas legales o ilegales, mayor policonsumo y mayor participación en la vida nocturna Normalmente el inicio del cannabis viene precedido por el de alcohol y tabaco pero para un grupo este inicio es prácticamente simultáneo, y ello da lugar a uno consumidores con unas características determinadas. Diversos datos del estudio apuntan a que el consumo de cannabis genera dependencia en algunos consumidores, aunque no se puede establecer su origen y naturaleza.

In fact, some drugs can even change a person's body and brain in ways that last long after the person has stopped taking drugs, maybe even permanently. Most abused drugs directly or indirectly target the brain's reward system by flooding the circuit with dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter present in regions of the brain that regulate movement, emotion, cognition, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. When drugs enter the brain, they can actually change how the brain performs its jobs. These changes are what lead to compulsive drug use, the hallmark of addiction. Although initial drug use may be voluntary, drugs have been shown to alter brain chemistry, which interferes with an individual's ability to make decisions and can lead to compulsive craving, seeking and use. This then becomes a substance dependency. All drugs of abuse - nicotine, cocaine, marijuana, and others - affect the brains \"reward” circuit, which is part of the limbic system. This flood of dopamine is what causes the \"high” or euphoria associated with drug abuse.",

      "abstract": "Vaping uses an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) for inhaling vaporized and aerosolized ingredients. A significant subset of the psychiatric patient population will use ENDS and may have concurrent cigarette usage. In the clinical case highlighted here, a patient with significant nicotine use is prescribed clozapine. He typically inhales vaporized nicotine solution, but during a chemical dependency treatment, he was provided cigarettes instead of ENDS to prevent him from consuming substances other than nicotine. Exposure to cigarette smoke led to clinically worsening psychotic symptoms that reversed when he was discharged from treatment, stopped cigarette use, and resumed ENDS use. However, his extremely high nicotine exposure then led to symptoms resembling an anxiety disorder, which resolved when ENDS use decreased. Psychiatrists must become familiar with patients' vaping and smoking habits and be alert to altered plasma drug levels in patients whose method of nicotine ingestion changes over time.",

      "title": "Natural Addiction",
      "abstract": "The distinction between natural addiction and drug addiction is interesting from many points of view, including scientific and medical perspectives. \"Natural addictions\" are those based on activation of a physiobehavioral system, such as the one that controls metabolism, foraging, and eating to achieve energy balance. \"Drug addictions\" activate many systems based on their pharmacology. This review discusses the following questions: (1) When does food produce a natural addiction? Sugar causes signs of addiction if the scheduling conditions are appropriate to cause binge eating. (2) Why does addictive-like behavior result? Bingeing on a 10% sucrose solution repeatedly releases dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, and it delays the release of acetylcholine, thereby postponing satiety. Opioid involvement is shown by withdrawal caused by naloxone or food deprivation. Bingeing, withdrawal, and abstinence-induced motivation are described as the basis for a vicious cycle leading to excessive eating. (3) Which foods can lead to natural addiction? A variety of sugars, saccharin, and sham feeding are compared with bingeing on high-fat diets, which seem to lack sugar's opioid-withdrawal characteristic. (4) How does natural food addiction relate to obesity? Low basal dopamine may be a common factor, leading to \"eating for dopamine.\" (5) In a neural model, the accumbens is depicted as having separate GABA output pathways for approach and avoidance, both controlled by dopamine and acetylcholine. These outputs, in turn, control lateral hypothalamic glutamate release, which starts a meal, and GABA release, which stops it.",

Compared with the non‐bulimic alcoholics, they were significantly younger and heavier and reported the onset of problem drinking at an earlier age. Most describe their binge eating as occurring before the onset of problem drinking. There was no association between bout drinking and binge eating. Bulimic alcoholics were less likely to have alcoholic fathers. It is suggested that bulimic alcoholics form a sub‐group similar to the multiple impulse form of bulimia nervosa in that they have distinct clinical features and a poorer response to treatment.",

Environmental factors and how individuals react to them can, therefore, have powerful influences on drinking behavior. On the other hand, the neuropsychopharmacological actions of ethanol and how different individuals react to them can be important biological determinants. Ethanol's action is biphasic, i.e., it can be reinforcing (rewarding) in the low concentration range, but averse at high concentrations.1 Perception by the individual of the reinforcing actions of ethanol might be expected to maintain alcohol-seeking behavior, whereas aversive effects would be expected to extinguish this behavior. Identification of the environmental and biological variables that promote and maintain alcohol-seeking or alcohol self-administration behavior is key to our understanding of the disorder alcoholism itself.",

Alcohol use is the most severe drug problem among both young people and adults; almost half the Spanish population drink daily, and more than a fourth drink a quantity of alcohol sufficient to cause health problems in the long term. The consumption of alcohol may be considered to be culturally rooted when compared with other drug use which follows a more recent epidemic pattern. For those who use other drugs, for example cannabis and cocaine, alcohol is commonly used in conjunction. Clearly the level of alcohol use and abuse is high in Spain and constitutes a severe public health and socioeconomic problem.",

      "abstract": "L'OMS include dipendenza da tabacco nella lista dei disturbi legati all'uso di sostanze farmacologiche e come tale deve essere trattata. Quindi il fumo di sigaretta oltre ad essere un vizio e/o un'abitudine e una vera e propria dipendenza. Infatti, delle 4000 sostanze tossiche che contiene una sigaretta, troviamo nicotina che e quella sostanza che induce alla dipendenza. E' sostanza che fa si che il fumatore cerchi sempre un'altra sigaretta e non riesca a farne a meno. La medicina ufficiale solo nel 1988 ha affermato che nicotina dava dipendenza come altre droghe, quali l'eroina e cocaina: la nicotina e sostanza contenuta nel tabacco che porta alla dipendenza... l'uso del tabacco risponde ai criteri correntemente utilizzati per definire l'assuefazione. Ecco perche per molti fumatori e difficile smettere di fumare. In questa prospettiva le proprieta gratificanti della nicotina e delle altre sostanze psicoattive dopo somministrazione in acuto possono essere inquadrate nel costrutto teorico delle azioni di rinforzo positivo delle droghe, mentre le proprieta motivazionali dell’astinenza possono essere considerate alla stregua di rinforzi negativi alla sospensione delle droghe d’abuso. Da queste considerazioni nasce nel quartiere Scampia di Napoli “Il progetto sfuma”, fortemente voluto dal Ministero della Salute, il Ministero del Lavoro e della Previdenza Sociale, dalla Regione Campania e dal Comune di Napoli, come strumento utile per liberare risorse in questo campo per tutela della salute pubblica. Al momento sono stati selezionati 80 operatori che hanno partecipato ad un corso di formazione specifico (aula e stage) per poi essere inseriti nei centri antifumo coordinati da dirigenti sanitari.",

Although smoking is associated with weight loss, it increases insulin resistance and attributes to other features of the metabolic syndrome, increasing the cardiometabolic risk profile. Whether vaping has the same deleterious effects on metabolic parameters as regular cigarette smoke has not yet been studied thoroughly in humans. However, animal model experiments attribute comparable effects of e‐cigarette smoking, even without nicotine exposure, on weight and metabolic parameters as compared to smoking cigarettes. In this review paper, we want to give an overview of published data on the effects on weight and cardiometabolic parameters of e‐cigarette use and formulate some mechanistic hypotheses.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol is one of the most common beverages consumed in today's society. Its vast popularity at various levels makes it one of the highest causes of driving fatalities, especially in the United States. Reports and statistics state that over 65 million people are struggling with alcoholism disorder. Alcoholism is a medical, social and economic problems where treatment methods mostly include difficult and long-lasting psychotherapy and in some cases, quite controversial pharmacological approaches. No medicine can 'cure' alcohol use disorder, but some can help you to recover. They can make drinking less enjoyable so you don't want to do it as such; e.g., disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, etc. But there are various side effects of synthetic drugs such as excessive use of acamprosate may results in abdominal pain, confusion, and increase urination. Naltrexone results stomach cramping, anxiety, etc. Excessive use of disulfiram shows polyneuritis, hepatitis, acneiform eruption, etc. The developments of alcoholism remedies have medical, social, and economical significance. In view of the adverse behavioral effects of synthetic drugs, the development of low toxicity and high efficiency medicines derived from natural products exhibits expansive market prospects. A 24number of medicinal plants and pure natural compounds are reported to have preventive and therapeutic effect on alcoholism and alcohol dependency, but their constituents, efficacy, and mechanism of action are mostly unknown so far. The reduction of alcohol absorption from the gastrointestinal system appears to be a common feature among most of the plants. The aim of this book chapter is to provide an overview of effective natural products for the prevention and treatment of chronic alcohol-use disorder.",

      "abstract": "'Consonant' smokers know and accept the risks associated with tobacco consumption, and do not wish to change their smoking, whereas 'dissonant' smokers are tobacco consumers whose attitudes differ from their behaviour. Dissonant smokers have several options: to quit smoking (the optimal solution), reduce their smoking, switch products or brands, or do nothing. To date, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the best‐established medical aid to smoking cessation, but several important factors impact on NRT use. As smokers constitute a diverse group there is a need for various different formulations, some of which will suit certain smokers better than others. Smokers should be allowed to select their preferred products in order to increase compliance, and should also be permitted to combine various products if desired. Adequate dosage regimens should be stressed in order to avoid under‐dosing, which is common with NRT. It is also essential that the medical system focuses increasingly on the diagnosis and treatment of those smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking. High nicotine dependence correlates with a high risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease; because these smokers cannot quit, cessation efforts have little impact on the incidence of tobacco‐related diseases in this population. Additional smoking control interventions, such as smoking reduction therapy, are therefore required to treat this group. Our experience in Vienna shows that these smokers can be targeted through approaches that utilize new messages offering alternatives to cessation.",

Les risques lies a l'utilisation de cette drogue illicite, la plus consommee dans le monde, particulierement chez les adolescents, font regulierement l’objet de debat. L'association entre le cannabis et la psychose est reconnue, mais est-elle cause ou consequence d’experiences psychotiques ou le cannabis serait une sorte d’automedication ? Pour tenter de repondre a cette question, un echantillon representatif de 1923 jeunes de la region de Munich a ete selectionne par tirage au sort dans la population generale. Ils ont ete evalues en debut d’etude (T1), apres 3,5 (T2) puis 8,4 ans (T3). Chez ceux qui n'avaient ni symptomes psychotiques ni utilisation de cannabis a T1, l'usage du cannabis a T2 etait associe a une augmentation du risque de symptomes psychotiques durant la periode T2-T3 (OR ajuste 1,9 ; 1,1-3,1 ; p = 0,021). L’usage prolonge de cannabis etait associe a une augmentation du risque de persistance de ces symptomes (OR 2,2 ; 1,2-4,2 ; p = 0,016). Le taux d’incidence des symptomes psychotiques durant T1-T2 etait de 31 % chez les usagers de cannabis vs 20 % chez les non-usagers, et durant T2-T3 de 14 % vs 8 %. L'usage intermittent de cannabis apparait ainsi comme facteur de risque de symptomes psychotiques ; son usage prolonge pourrait augmenter le risque de persistance de ces symptomes. 1.

      "abstract": "Since the neuroprotective effects of coffee and tobacco on Parkinson’s disease have been reported more than 50 years ago, clinical studies using caffeine and nicotine that were presumed as effective components of coffee and tobacco, respectively, are being actively executed. However, most results failed to show significant differences between the tested and control groups, and some studies revealed contradictory results to the neuroprotection. The reason for this might be that the effective components are something other than nicotine or caffeine, and/or differences to design the clinical trials such as patients recruiting, prescribed amount and period, and analyzed criteria etc. The review summarizes recent results for effect of coffee, tobacco as well as alcohol, representatives of indulgent food, on Parkinson’s disease.",

Studies involving healthy volunteers suggest that ethanol consumption inhibits toluene metabolism, thus increasing its blood levels. In this study, a lethal case of combined ethanol consumption and toluene inhalation has been reported. Our case was a 30-year-old male who had used volatile substance for 15 years. The autopsy revealed no abnormal findings. Toxicological analysis revealed alcohol and toluene in the blood and the cause of death was considered as toxicity due to acute combined intake of alcohol and toluene. Lethal combined ethanol and toluene intake is rarely reported in the literature. Experimental studies indicate that toluene increases the risk of ethanol dependence and each substance increases the toxic effects of the other.",

      "abstract": "As ways of discouraging tobacco consumption, the effects of increases in price and in quantitative information may have been under-emphasized. To decrease the hazards of tobacco, switches from cigarettes to pipes, cigars or 'smokeless' tobacco may be useful, as may a reduction in cigarette tar delivery. Indeed, the spread of existing tar level reductions from capitalist to socialist countries might prevent tens of thousands of lung cancer deaths each year in the early decades of the next century, and (perhaps by attempts to engineer cigarettes so that smokers of lower tar cigarettes are less likely to 'compensate' by taking more smoke) it should eventually also be possible to change cigarettes so as also to reduce their effects on heart and lung disease. Changes in consumption and in composition of tobacco products are complementary, not competing, strategies. If both are pursued effectively, then although the life expectancy of old people may not be much improved, the proportion of adults who die before reaching old age will decrease substantially.",

      "abstract": "The benzodiazepines, discovered and developed during the past 20 years, have become one of the most widely used group of drugs in the world at the present, some have suggested too widely used. The extent of therapeutic use is examined relative to the incidence of disorders associated with anxiety and it is concluded that, in general, the benzodiazepines are used conservatively by doctors rather than overused, and that their current consumption is not excessive relative to the level of emotional morbidity in the community. However, as with all psychoactive substances, dependence, both psychological and physical, can occur. This is of the alcohol-barbiturate type, though of less severity. The incidence of dependence under both therapeutic and abuse circumstance is quantified and found to be very low. The social significance of this level of dependence is examined relative to both the overall reliance of society on pleasure-giving activities, and the puritan ethics still applicable to mental illnesses. Conclusions are drawn about appropriate action that might be taken to reduce dependence.",

      "abstract": "Résumé Au Québec, les taux d’allaitement sont déplorables et encore plus chez les mères fumeuses. Les intervenants en santé publique cherchent à augmenter les taux d’allaitement et à éliminer le tabagisme. Doit-on « prioriser » les interventions pour lutter contre le tabac, promouvoir l’allaitement ou cibler ces deux objectifs à la fois ? Cet article tente de trouver des réponses scientifiques à cette question à travers une revue de littérature exhaustive des dix dernières années. On remarque que les mères fumeuses allaitent moins, sont plus jeunes, moins scolarisées et plus défavorisées. De plus, les mères qui allaitent et qui fument cessent plus rapidement l’allaitement que les mères non fumeuses. Or, la période de la grossesse est un moment privilégié pour cesser la consommation tabagique mais le taux de rechute après la naissance est très élevé. Devant la difficulté à cesser de fumer ou à maintenir l’abstinence tabagique, ces mères devraient malgré tout allaiter puisque les effets bénéfiques de l’allaitement aideraient à réduire les méfaits du tabagisme. L’utilisation du timbre à nicotine peut être envisagé dans un but d’augmenter la cessation tabagique. Jusqu’à présent, peu d’études ont été réalisées chez les femmes allaitantes fumeuses. L’utilisation des substituts nicotiniques sur une base plus régulière demeure un enjeu afin de mieux évaluer les risques à court et à moyen terme.",

Participants with a severe history of weight cycling had a significantly younger age of onset of their obesity than did mild cyclers and reported initiating dieting at a significantly younger age and lower weight. No evidence, however, was found that weight cycling was associated with greater reports of depression or other psychopathology; nor was it associated with a significantly greater frequency of binge eating disorder.

Alcohol has been used in all cultures throughout recorded history, but tobacco only became widely available after the discovery of the New World. At first, tobacco use was restricted to the wealthy class, but by the beginning of the seventeenth century, combined exposure to alcohol and tobacco was common in all classes (Figure 36.1). Both agents are addictive, although nicotine, the major addictive compound contained in tobacco, is probably more so than alcohol. Both agents are widely used: nearly 80% of Americans over age 12 have consumed alcohol at some time, which is similar to the percentage of persons who report ever using tobacco. However, less than one-third of adults are current smokers-much smaller than the proportion of current alcohol users.",

As pointed out with regard to attributing causation between alcohol use and alcohol related problems: 'Causality here is not a matter of Newtonian physics, and uncertainty is part of every equation' (Edwards et al., 1994). The uncertainty in attributing causation is all the greater with substances other than alcohol and tobacco. Users of illicit drugs seldom use only one drug exclusively. Heroin users in some countries, for example, will often use benzodiazepines. In many countries the majority of illicit drug users also use tobacco. Attributing causality to the use of a particular drug is therefore difficult.",

Segundo orgaos da saude, sao padronizadas quantidades dessa bebida que podem ser ingeridas sem oferecer riscos maiores a saude biopsicossocial dos individuos, no entanto, tais quantidades podem ser facilmente ultrapassadas devido aos padroes culturais de inclusao e interacao sociais, fazendo com que o consumo seja influenciado pelo desejo de insercao em diversos grupos e status enaltecidos pela sociedade, dentre outros fatores de ordem social que levam o individuo a fazer uso excessivo da bebida para fugir a uma realidade, muitas vezes, cruel do ponto de vista da privacao de direitos basicos. O uso excessivo, aliado ou nao a fatores geneticos, pode levar os consumidores ao estado de dependencia e, a partir dai, uma serie de fatores e consequencias negativas passarao a surgir no cotidiano dessas pessoas e de seus familiares. Nesse sentido, todo o caos que o alcoolismo gera na vida das pessoas vitimas dessa doenca, atinge, de forma direta, o restante do ciclo em que ele convive. Assim, foi realizada uma pesquisa de campo dentro de um grupo de autoajuda destinado a familiares de dependentes, cujo nome e Al-Anon, com o objetivo de conhecer a realidade das familias vitimas da doenca do alcoolismo, bem como os impactos que o Al-Anon causa na vida delas. A pesquisa, atraves do metodo da observacao participante, que ocorreu em um periodo de dois meses, bem como a utilizacao de pesquisas documentais, concluiu que o Al-Anon exerce positiva influencia no processo de enfrentamento a problematica do alcoolismo, fornecendo apoio e esperanca ao seus membros, como tambem, mostrou que os dependentes sao beneficiados, indiretamente, pelo trabalho com seus familiares que frequentam o grupo.

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Of mice and Men; Neurobehavioral and toxicological effects of e-cigarettes exposure. Tim Marczylo1*, Nathan Goldsmith1, 2, Elizabeth Zhuikova1, 2 and Alexis Bailey2 1 PHE, Toxicology, United Kingdom 2 St George's University of London, Institute of Medical and Biomedical Education, United Kingdom Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have proved very popular with smokers and a meteoric rise in their usage is currently under way. People purchase them as an aid to giving up smoking, to reduce cigarette consumption, to minimise withdrawal symptoms in environments that ban smoking, and in order to continue smoking with decreased health risks. Although the safety and impact on health of e-cigarettes, especially after long-term use, has not been evaluated, they are generally considered to be far safer alternatives to traditional tobacco cigarettes. This decrease in toxicity is predicted as a consequence of the absence or significantly reduced levels of the majority of toxicants in e-cigarette vape compared to tobacco smoke. However, there is evidence that the presence of nicotine in nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) can still generate carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines, albeit at very low concentrations in comparison with tobacco smoke. These nitrosamines are oesophageal and pulmonary carcinogens therefore nicotine delivery to the lung by e-cigarettes may carry an additional risk than other NRT. Additionally, nicotine itself is not without risk. Consequently, it is imperative to ascertain the toxicity risk of consuming nicotine through e-cigarettes. Our pilot study will monitor levels of nicotine, cotinine and carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines in the urine of heavy smokers (>10 cigarettes/day) who give up smoking and completely transition to e-cigarette use for a period of 4 weeks. Levels of other biomarkers which are known to be associated with smoking toxicity, such as DNA adducts and DNA methylation, will also be monitored in biological fluids of these subjects. Moreover, cigarette craving, mood, anxiety, social anxiety, well-being status and stress hormones (cortisol, oxytocin) will be measured throughout the transition from cigarette to e-cigarette use for 4 weeks to assess the psychological effect of the transition. Finally, brain electrical activity will be measured by electroencephalography pre- and post- transition to e-cigarette use. Study compliance will be monitored by expired carbon monoxide and urinary anabasine. A parallel study will be conducted in mice whereby nose only exposure to e-cigarette vape for a period of 90 days will be assessed for the aforementioned markers. Additionally, quantitative receptor autoradiography will be carried out in brains of these animals to investigate the effect of exposure to e-cigarette vapour on NMDA glutamate receptors, dopamine and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (e.g. alpha4beta2 nAChRs) and cholinergic transporters in different brain regions. Overall, the results from these studies will provide important information on the safety and effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation which we anticipate will drive policy decisions with respect to e-cigarettes and their use.

Namun kebiasaan tersebut bisa berhenti pada beberapa orang, meskipun telah bertahun-tahun mengonsumsi minuman beralkohol. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui dinamika taubat pada pengonsumsi minuman beralkohol. Responden dalam penelitian ini adalah empat orang yang pernah menjadi pengonsumsi minuman beralkohol namun saat ini sudah bertaubat. Peneliti melakukan wawancara secara mendalam terhadap keempat orang subjek tersebut dan mengamati perilaku mereka selama satu bulan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa ada kondisi internal maupun eksternal yang mengiringi subjek selama melalui proses taubat. Orang yang mengonsumsi minuman beralkohol serta melakukan perbuatan-perbuatan menyimpang lainnya pada tahap tertentu akan merasakan kejenuhan yang menjadi sebab utama untuk bertaubat. Rasa jenuh tersebut merupakan hidayah dari Allah yang diberikan pada orang-orang yang dikehendaki-Nya. Dukungan keluarga dan dukungan sosial serte komitmen yang kuat menjadi faktor yang penting bagi subjek agar tetap bertahan dalam proses taubat.",

However, the drinking alcohol is associated with a risk of adverse health and social effects related to its intoxicating, toxic and dependence-producing properties. In addition to the chronic diseases that may develop in those who drink large quantity of alcohol over a number of years, alcohol use also results in development of various dental diseases. Alcohol may adversely affect salivary glands which in turn may lead to tooth decay. Alcohol can cause irritation and inflammation of oral soft tissues including gingiva, tongue, etc. Non-carious destructions of teeth like dental erosion are also related to regular alcohol drinking. Hence, a review has been attempted regarding effect of alcohol on oral health.",

      "abstract": "In England and Scotland, 24% of adults regularly drink over the chief medical officer’s low-risk guidelines, and 27% of drinkers in Great Britain binge drink on their heaviest drinking days.1 A recent article2 suggests 41.3% of pregnant women in the UK consume alcohol at some point during pregnancy, which can be extrapolated to a modelled estimate prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) of 3.2%.\n\nPrenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading preventable cause of intellectual and developmental disabilities in the world.3 FASDs result from PAE. The shame and stigma of drinking during pregnancy and the fear of losing their children often prevent women from honestly disclosing their usage histories with their child’s paediatrician. Keeping these ‘secrets’ about alcohol consumption makes it difficult to make a correct diagnosis in children and can lead to relapse, stress, depression, anxiety and an escalation in drinking.4 Women should not be blamed or shamed when they expose a pregnancy to alcohol or other substances.4\n\n> Hearing the words ‘Your daughter has fetal alcohol syndrome’ hit me like a tsunami. I was drowning in waves of grief, disbelief, horror and remorse. In 1984, my daughter was born full-term weighing 5 lbs 12 oz. I went home from the hospital with a small but perfectly normal baby. The first two years we experienced many delayed milestones: she crawled, walked, and talked late. Her first pediatrician used to tell me ‘there is something not quite right about her, but I just can’t put my finger on it’. That used to bother me so much because to me she was simply perfect.\n> \n> When I took her to the new doctor for her 2-year check-up, I was asked all the typical milestone questions which I answered honestly. At one point, the pediatrician asked me if …",

Appropriate adjustments need to be made to pinpoint the role of either factor. Both smoking and drinking play a role in cancer of the buccal cavity, pharynx and oesophagus; they seem to multiply their effects. Cancer of the larynx is also related to both alcohol and tobacco, but the role of alcohol appears only when exposure to tobacco is also present. While tobacco smoke is known to contain carcinogens, the mechanisms by which alcohol provoke cancer remain obscure; it may act by facilitating the penetration of carcinogens in the mucosa-carcinogens might be present in some alcoholic beverages; a direct action of ethanol can not be excluded. Epidemiological evidence is clear enough, however, to predict a substantial drop of incidence of buccal, pharyngeal, oesophageal and laryngeal cancers if alcohol and tobacco consumption could be reduced.",

Los estilos y cultura del uso exponen estas personas a innumeras situaciones de riesgo, tales como enfermedades sexualmente trasmisibles, embarazo indeseado, actos de violencia, robos y trafico de drogas.Las implicaciones asociadas al uso de crack representan un problema importante para las politicas publicas de salud, para la ensenanza e investigacion de la practica clinica de los profesionales involucrados en la atencion de salud y especialmente para los profesionales de enfermeria, que constituyen las categorias mas numerosas en el equipo de salud.En Brasil, en el 2010, el Ministerio de la Salud instituyo el Plan Integrado de Enfrentamiento al Crack y Otras Drogas, visando a la prevencion del uso, al tratamiento y a la reinsercion social de usuarios y a la capacitacion profesionales, adoptando como premisa que el usuario del crack tiene derecho a salud y a rehacer su proyecto de vida.

While on the decline, it continues to be a major problem that is feasible but difficult to remedy, in particular once an individual is addicted to nicotine. On the bright side, effective treatments are available although very few people are taking advantage of these tools. The standard of care and evidenced-based treatment consist of behavioral in conjunction with pharmacological therapy. In the United States, there are seven pharmacological agents approved for use as single agents, while for heavily addicted or recalcitrant smokers a combination of more than one agent may be needed. Nicotine replacement products offer a safe way to transition from the harm of smoking tobacco to using only medicinal doses of nicotine for a gradual transition to total abstinence. E-cigarettes can be seen as a less harmful alternative to smoking; however, little is known about their potential for harm on long-term use.",

      "title": "Promoting smoking cessation through smoking reduction during Ramadan",
      "abstract": "Ramadan restricts smoking and leads to reduction. Recent research on reduction has focused upon using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as a substitute for missed cigarettes and behavioural approaches have been neglected, despite evidence of efficacy. Ramadan reminds us of the need to harness these natural experiments to enhance smoking reduction and hence cessation. Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, marks the period when Muslims fast during daylight hours to learn patience, humility, sacrifice, self-restraint and, above all, God-consciousness. It is a time of increased devotion to God and spiritual renewal. During the month, Muslims should not eat, drink (any liquid) or smoke from dawn to dusk. In the United Kingdom, there is a national smoking cessation service that has ambitious targets for throughput and a responsibility to reach all ethnic groups. Many public health authorities have used the start of Ramadan as a spur to encourage smoking cessation [1,2], using several lines of reasoning. Enforced abstinence from smoking during daylight will engender withdrawal for many regular smokers [3]. With sustained abstinence withdrawal will subside, but not with continued smoking during darkness, so the period of Ramadan is uncomfortable for many smokers unless they become totally abstinent. Secondly, lapsing during a quit attempt makes achieving prolonged abstinence much less likely [4], and the prohibition against smoking during the day and the absence of others smoking could assist the quit attempt [5]. Thirdly, the element of spiritual renewal could lead to changes in a person's sense of self that might bolster cessation success. Gonzales et al. reported that nine out of 10 smokers in Oregon, United States, had previously believed or currently recognized some higher power [6]. Three-quarters of smokers reported believing that drawing upon spirituality could be helpful when quitting, and the same proportion felt that smoking cessation counsellors should encourage smokers to do so in clinics. This is similar to the treatment of other addictions where discussion of spiritual resources is common, for example, in Alcoholics Anonymous [7]. There are, however, potential disadvantages to encouraging abrupt cessation at the start of Ramadan. Chief among these is that few Muslims take the opportunity to attend smoking cessation clinics. It is possible that our current focus on cessation at the expense of the perhaps more achievable target of smoking reduction is alienating those who might otherwise engage. Whether unassisted attempts at cessation are common is not known, and whether they are more successful at this time is also unknown. Furthermore, most supported cessation attempts involve medication, but many Muslims believe that Ramadan precludes oral medication during daylight, meaning that oral nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is inappropriate and so, perhaps, is varenicline and bupropion. Abstaining from food increases the urge to smoke [8,9], which might make Ramadan a more difficult time to stop smoking abruptly. Finally, forced abstinence in itself does not lead to permanent cessation in most people [10,11]. Is it possible to make better use of the Ramadan fast to enhance cessation? One way might be through smoking reduction as an initial target. The fast means that smokers cannot smoke during daylight and this is likely to result in reduced smoking. Most smokers do not want to stop imminently, but most report trying to reduce [12]. There is good evidence that smoking reduction programmes enhance cessation [13,14]. Most of these programmes used short-acting NRT to replace missed cigarettes, but this is not an option during Ramadan. However, there are behavioural approaches to smoking reduction. All these behavioural methods constrain when smokers can smoke, as does Ramadan. Several behavioural methods have been used. These include scheduled smoking, where a person smokes on a strict time schedule (for example, every hour) which lengthens progressively [15]. Smoking is precluded at all other times. Hierarchical smoking requires a person to describe the times that they smoke and then eliminate particular cigarettes progressively, starting with the easiest or the hardest [16]. Another method described is for a person to avoid smoking in the first hour after waking and then increase this period of morning abstinence progressively until the whole day is covered [17]. One method we have used, which fits well into a culture that outlaws smoking in many situations, is use of smoke-free periods [18]. People map their 'smoking breaks' and decrease these gradually by lengthening the period between breaks. There is some evidence that these behavioural methods are more effective than simply advising cutting down and leaving the choice of when to miss cigarettes to the person [15,19]. One reason why behavioural approaches might work is that a person is no longer 'allowed' to smoke in particular circumstances, and this could undermine a learned association between cue and smoking that many believe maintains tobacco addiction. Most recent research on smoking reduction has focused upon NRT. However, population data suggest that NRT use for reduction does not achieve the same success as achieved by programmes with behavioural support [12,20]. Behavioural approaches to reduction require that a person learns and follows the approach. If we are to use Ramadan to enhance cessation through reduction, we are likely to need to engage Muslim smokers not only to follow the fast, but to continue the method of controlling their smoking after the fast is broken. Explaining why this might help and providing support are likely to be necessary but so, too, is further research to develop and test behavioural approaches to reduction.

      "title": "Shame as a Public Health Intervention",
      "abstract": "The bioethicist Daniel Callahan has recently argued for ‘stigmatisation lite’ as a way to reduce the incidence of obesity. ‘The force of being shamed and beat upon socially’ worked for him when he stopped smoking, and a positive application of social pressure has been influential in behaviour change related to, for example, the reduction of drink driving, so why can’t we shame people into losing weight? Criticism of the paper was swift and multifaceted, but it turned out that he didn’t intend to stigmatise the obese at all – only to use social pressure (if that is possible) on the not-yet-obese or just a little overweight. Nevertheless his paper provides an opportunity to re-evaluate the use of stigma and shame as interventions in public health policy.\r\nPublic health policy is an enterprise which outwardly promotes personal choice, but encouraging and facilitating decision making based on capitulating to social conformity seems at odds with respecting personal autonomy. Health professionals spend a good deal of time and energy trying to increase self-esteem in stigmatised groups, and so a suggestion that we deliberately increase stigma, lite or otherwise, seems odd. Public health policy which aimed to increase stigma might be acceptable if it worked, but Callahan offered no evidence that it would.\r\nBut the rejection of stigma and shame as public health tools to reduce obesity does not necessarily reject the use of social emotions in public health policy. Differences between guilt and shame are discussed and I argue that in some circumstances fostering guilt for direct harms to others may be ethically acceptable. Television anti-smoking campaigns are used as examples it is tentatively concluded that Callahan’s ill-received paper promoting obesity shame should not obscure the possibility of using social emotions in public health policy elsewhere.",

Cigarettes are not a taboo in society, especially the people of Indonesia. Cigarettes can be categorized as addictive substances that can cause addiction for the consumer. Not only addiction, there are many bad things such as damaging health that can be caused by smoking. Besides that, smokers usually often use cigarettes in public places if the smoke can disturb the surrounding community. Even though it has been explained about the area where there is no smoke. In fact, this has been regulated in the Indonesian Criminal Law as evidence that the government is very serious in responding to this matter. In the realm of Islamic law, there are already other provisions regarding to this matter. Although it is not explained in detail about smoking, it can still be likened to other things such as khamr. The destructive behavior of active smokers can disturb the surrounding community so that criminal law enforcement and Islamic law can be applied to violators of these rules. This is to create a situation where the general public is not disturbed by the destructive behavior of smokers.",

Because smoking is for many smokers a pleasure, and an activity rich in social and cultural meaning, it is natural for such smokers (and some non-smokers) to resist these attempts to control smoking. For those smokers for whom their smoking is no longer a pleasure, or for whom it may be a pleasure but who accept that it is a pleasure they wished they could forego, attempts to control smoking can be both aid and irritant.

      "title": "Electronic Cigarettes",
      "abstract": "Sir: The electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) is a battery-operated nicotine delivery device designed to simulate the behavior of smoking. Enclosed in the cigarette-shaped cylinder is a heating element that warms a chamber of liquid nicotine and different flavoring agents, lighting up when inhaled, and producing a white vapor of “smoke” when exhaled. As a way to differentiate it from traditional smoking, electronic cigarette use is often termed “vaping,” with users commonly referring to themselves as “vapers.” Since their introduction in the United States in 2009, electronic cigarettes have matured into over 200 different brand names, making up a $1.7 billion industry, with the projection to reach $10 billion within the decade.1 According to the International Tobacco Control Four-Country Survey, electronic cigarette use has more than doubled (from 2.9 percent to 6.7 percent) from 2011 to 2012.2 Marketed as a smoking cessation aid, abstinence with electronic cigarettes (7.3 percent) is modestly more effective compared with forms of nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch, 5.5 percent).3 Nicotine replacement therapies differ from electronic cigarettes in that they contain controlled amounts of nicotine (7 to 14 mg/24-hour patch or 2 to 4 mg per piece of gum) and have been labeled as medicinal products by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, allowing physician monitoring and appropriate tapering of high-dose therapy. Electronic cigarettes, in contrast, are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and can be bought over-the-counter or online. Electronic cigarettes currently have no limitation on the amount of nicotine they contain. Although standard dosing is between 8 and 24 mg/ml per cartridge, doses up to 100 mg/ml are readily available. In light of these differences, the European Commission has proposed that electronic cigarettes constitute the first of a new category termed “nicotine-containing products.”4 The primary ingredient in electronic cigarettes is nicotine, a substance that has known negative effects for the surgery patient. In addition to nicotine-induced hypertension and insulin resistance, the vascular effects of nicotine include peripheral vasoconstriction and inhibition of endothelial-dependent vasodilation, both potentially compromising tissue flaps with a fragile blood supply.5 Wound dehiscence, surgical-site infections, lack of bone fusion, and hernia complications seen commonly with tobacco smoking may also be seen with nicotine alone, as quality data on the role of nicotine in causing these complications are lacking.5 A recent systematic review concluded that nicotine replacement therapies have neither detrimental nor beneficial effects on postoperative outcomes, but felt that this may be because of the low dose of nicotine absorbed from these products.4 It has been shown that seasoned vapers can attain blood nicotine levels nearly equivalent to traditional smokers (10 to 20 ng/ml).6 Despite a theoretical decreased risk of lung and oropharyngeal cancer because of the absence of tobacco constituents, surgeons should expect similar surgical risk with e-cigarette use compared with traditional cigarettes. Plastic surgeons in particular have a large portion of elective patients, perform operations consisting of flaps with tenuous blood supply, and have patients with preexisting conditions compromising circulation. An awareness of the electronic cigarette epidemic, along with the associated terminology, is important, as it may translate into improved surgical decision-making and, ultimately, improved postoperative surgical outcomes.

A combination of dietary and physical activity interventions, along with one or more behavioral approaches, has proven successful in some persons, as documented by the National Weight Control Registry, but is limited by adherence to a consistent weight loss regimen. Successful approaches to weight loss maintenance include consulting with a physician, nutritionist, or another support source; adhering to a stable diet with a limited variety of food; monitoring weight; eating breakfast; and exercising regularly. Long-term pharmacologic treatments for weight loss maintenance have been studied and were found to have modest success, with some weight regain typically reported. Sibutramine and orlistat are the two medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration with the potential to help patients achieve long-term weight loss maintenance. Bariatric surgery is another modality for accomplishing successful long-term weight loss maintenance in patients with morbid or complicated obesity. Its success is due in large part to better weight loss outcomes, more successful long-term weight loss maintenance, and remission of comorbid medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "Button batteries can be lethal if ingested and not promptly excreted or removed.These batteries are present in a multitude of household items including car remotes, IT devices, and many consumer items targeted at children.There are various technologies available for button batteries and they are produced in various sizes.Lithium button batteries with a diameter of 20mm or more pose the greatest risk.Most at risk are children of 0-5 years.At this age, there is a propensity to put foreign objects in the mouth.These batteries once swallowed, rather than passing through the alimentary canal and being excreted, may lodge in the oesophagus where they will burn through tissue, sometimes trough to the trachea, sometimes through to the aorta.This will be fatal for the child if the problem is not promptly identified and the battery then promptly extracted.Death will follow within several weeks of ingestion, following episodes of ill health, if the problem is not recognised.The presenting symptoms of ill health by the child can be misdiagnosed as food poisoning, a virus, an infection, or some common malady.Three child deaths in Australia from ingested button batteries (all 20mm lithium) are reported in the present paper.In each case, after prior misdiagnoses, the ingested battery was detected by X-ray, and, in each case, too late for successful intervention.Ingested button batteries can be detected by X-ray or ultrasound, but they may be indistinguishable from an ingested coin, which present less risk and are not actively corrosive.A new safety standard in Australia seeks to reduce the access of children to button batteries.The standard accepts the design status quo of button batteries, and seeks to avoid their misuse, in particular to stop them being ingested by young children.This is a safety-by-regulation approach.The alternative is a safety-by-design approach where the onus is on product designers to engineer safety into and danger out of the product.The twin problems of lithium button batteries are, firstly, their size where they are small enough to be easily swallowed by children but large enough to lodge in the oesophagus (where they are ≥20mm in diameter), and secondly, their bio -reactivity with flesh, which is partly a matter of chemistry but also partly a matter of the surface areas of the electrodes (which are extensive surfaces rather than point electrodes).",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use and somatic consequences. Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world. It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids.Complications somatiques du cannabis. Le cannabis reste la substance illicite la plus consommée dans le monde. La perception du cannabis comme une substance peu dangereuse au regard de son origine végétale participe à l’augmentation de son usage. La puissance du cannabis est définie par un ratio élevé entre les composants les plus importants du cannabis, c’est-à-dire letétrahydrocannabinol et le cannabidiol. Les effets aigus et chroniques de l’usage du cannabis comportent un risque majoré de troubles psychiatriques, mais aussi de complications cardiovasculaires, neurovasculaires et neurocognitives, respiratoires et de sevrage en cas de dépendance. Avec l’apparition récente des cannabinoïdes de synthèse qui sont des substances chimiques contrairement au cannabis issu de la plante, des complications plus sévères sont décrites même lors d’usage unique. Ces nouvelles substances de synthèse, bien qu’appelées aussi cannabis par les utilisateurs, ont conduit à une modification des prises en charge des usagers en raison d’une toxicité aiguë et chronique plus sévère.",

Research suggests that women experience addiction telescoping when they abuse alcohol, tobacco, specific stimulants, and possibly opioids. Medical side effects also develop more rapidly in women than men when they abuse many substances. Cancer and cardiac complications, specifically, pose a significant threat for women who abuse almost all types of substances. However, the physical consequences are not the only ones women suffer when they engage in substance abuse. Research on substance abuse in women ties opioids to mood and anxiety disorders, heroin to neurological deficiencies, cocaine to immune system suppression, and alcohol to intimate partner abuse. Additionally, female substance abusers, on average, have a lower level of education and lower rates of employment. In light of these gender-specific concerns, physicians should give particular consideration to detecting substance abuse in women.",

Widespread drunkenness during the early 1990s facilitated privatization of economy: workers and some intelligentsia did not oppose privatizations because of drunkenness and involvement in illegal activities. Apparently, alcohol consumption and heavy binge drinking have been decreasing in Russia since approximately the last decade. Exaggeration of alcohol-related problems tends to veil shortages of the health care system. There are motives to exaggerate consumption of nonbeverage alcohol in order to veil the problem of toxicity of some legally sold beverages. It is essential to distinguish between legally and illegally sold rather than between recorded and unrecorded alcohol because sales of poor-quality alcoholic beverages in legally operating shops and kiosks occurred generally with knowledge of authorities.",

Bed sharing may increase the risk of SIDS, while use of a pacifier seems to be protective. Replacement of maternal smoking with nicotine substitutes is not harmless.To further reduce the risk of SIDS, exclusive supine sleeping should be encouraged and side sleeping discouraged. When the breast-feeding is established, a pacifier can very well be used at bedtime.

Its use is primarily related to easy accessibility, rather than social or monetary factors. Polydrug misuse and antisocial personality disorder are more frequent in NBA users, but use is not pathognomic of end-stage alcoholism. The 48 NBA users reported surprisingly few toxic symptoms from acute ingestion, perhaps because tolerance to some substances in NBA may occur.

The origin of individual preferences and values is one of the remaining theoretical questions in social and behavioral sciences. The Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis suggests that more intelligent individuals may be more likely to acquire and espouse evolutionarily novel values than less intelligent individuals. Consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs is evolutionarily novel, so the Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis would predict that more intelligent individuals are more likely to consume these substances. Analyses of two large, nationally representative, and prospectively longitudinal data from the United Kingdom and the United States partly support the prediction. More intelligent children, both in the United Kingdom and the United States, are more likely to grow up to consume more alcohol. More intelligent American children are more likely to grow up to consume more tobacco, while more intelligent British children are more likely to grow up to consume more illegal drugs.",

However, there is still the need to provide help for the smoker to quit. The evidence with regards to effective ways of getting smokers to quit and the effectiveness of different modalities is reviewed. Programs found to be effective include self-help, individual counseling, and group counseling. Counseling programs appear to double the effect of success compared to no program. Nicotine replacement therapy has been demonstrated to be an important adjunct therapy to the behavioral programs. Issues regarding the cessation of tobacco by youth need to be addressed distinctively from adult cessation.

The regulation concerning them varies drastically across the world. The health impact is still not fully understood. Although e-cigarettes contain less toxic substances compared to regular cigarettes their use is still not harmless. Some studies suggest a correlation between e-cigarettes and cardiovascular diseases and a potential cancer risk. However, the most noticeable is the effect on the respiratory system. There have been reported cases of fatal respiratory failure caused by e-cigarette use. There has been an increased interest in using e-cigarettes for recreational drug use, notably cannabinoids. E-liquids have been used in suicide attempts. They are usually ingested causing potentially lethal poisoning. Furthermore, lung biopsy and extensive medical history analysis should be the cornerstone of forensic examination of deaths involving e-cigarettes.",

Ephedra products are used as a slimming aid, (sports) performance enhancer, stimulant during long working hours and as a plant-based ecstasy-surrogate in the party scene. The health effects caused by the use of Ephedra products are mainly restlessness, agitation, tachycardia and palpitations. The most important risk factors are the relatively high amounts of Ephedra alkaloids in the preparations available, the varying concentrations within different batches of the same product, the relatively high risk of voluntary overdosing in order to improve results and the occurrence of interactions with the concurrent use of other stimulants and medicines.",

      "abstract": "The use of drugs for intoxication occupies a problematic space in the discussions of nineteenth-century inebriety. Physicians and reformers were familiar with alcohol consumption from first-hand experience, either of their own drinking or the drinking of people in their communities. Thus discussions about alcohol were not abstract. Notwithstanding that many of the images were stereotyped and at least moderately histrionic in construction, they drew upon familiar scenes and related to common (mis)conceptions of drink. The derelict drunk and the debased drinking space may have been tropes in nineteenth-century literature, but they were based upon familiarity. In contrast, drug inebriety was less common. Even though many people may have had experience with the effects of opium or other intoxicants (but most especially opium) through medical treatment, and even though some stories in popular fiction included elements of drug consumption, drug use was less public than drinking. As the chair of a mid-century select committee on intoxication in Canada West noted, drink was a public activity; opium consumption was done in private. 1 Moreover, as substances that were usually imported from faraway places, drugs like opium, cannabis, and cocaine were infused with exoticism, and racialized notions of the other. In much literature of the nineteenth century the meaning of opium, especially in its smoked form, was embedded in cultural myths of \"Asiatics\" or \"Chinamen\" in the Anglo-American world. Many of these images were delivered through the numerous accounts of westerners travelling throughout Asia as often brutal colonial regimes forced Asian nations to accept missionaries, most with a religious proselytization message, and almost always with a western superiority complex, into their territory.",

The neoclassical model of the consumer and its extensions provide the theoretical framework for most economic research on health behaviours. More recently, behavioural economic models that incorporate insights from psychology have been proposed as alternative models of health behaviours, especially behaviours involving addiction. Empirical economic research on health behaviours is extensive, and explores both the determinants and consequences of health behaviours.

Despite these effort, various contributing factors of smoking amongst which peer-pressure forms part, are believed to be cause of an increase in the number of new smokers. Nicotine is one of the constituents of tobacco smoke which causes a pleasant feelings which in return contributes to addiction. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals with some known to be carcinogens. Smoking during pregnancy poses danger to a pregnant mother and her unborn babe as they exchange blood.

      "abstract": "At a time of increased obesity, decreased physical activity, and high food consumption, the relationship between physical activity and appetite control needs to be examined. Many people believe that the energy expended as a result of physical activity generates a drive to eat. However, a counterintuitive conclusion arises since there is no compelling evidence that increased physical activity increases energy intake. A suppression of hunger occurs following intense exercise; however, this effect is brief and has no influence on energy intake. Indeed, there does not appear to be any within-day effect of exercise on energy intake. Day-to-day effects of exercise on energy intake could occur, but only a few provocative data exist showing a delayed effect of exercise on energy intake 2 d later. Therefore, there appears to be only a weak short-term coupling between energy expenditure and energy intake. What about the effects of increased physical activity on food selection? The natural hypothesis would be that the energy reserves used during exercise would estimate a drive for a particular nutrient. There is no clear consistent evidence to indicate that in the short-term, exercise induces changes in food or nutrient preferences. In the long-term there is some evidence that physical activity is associated with an increase in carbohydrate intake, but it is uncertain whether these changes are biologically driven for a result of changes of a psychological nature. Contrary to a popularly held view, food selection and nutrient intake constitute patterns of behavior held in place by environmental contingencies and short-acting post-ingestive physiological responses; these patterns of behavior are relatively immune to modulation by the metabolic effects of exercise.",

There has been a debate in psychiatry about whether or not we can infer a cause-and-effect relationship between the use of cannabis and psychotic disorders. In this editorial, we first present and critically discuss the evidence to date of the association between heavy cannabis use and psychosis. We argue that while the biological mechanisms underlying individual susceptibility to develop a psychotic disorder following heavy cannabis use are still unknown, heavy cannabis use remains the most modifiable risk factor for the onset of psychotic disorders and for its clinical and functional outcome. This demands a clear move towards both primary and secondary prevention intervention to reduce the impact of heavy cannabis use on the incidence and prevalence of psychotic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Although the overall consumption of alcohol is falling in Spain we have, for years, been seeing an increase in alcohol consumption by the young. This has taken the form of episodes of drunkenness or quantities of alcohol being drunk within a few concentrated hours to reach a certain level of drunkenness, what the Anglo-Saxons call \"binge drinking\". The most typical name for this phenomenon -although not the only one- is the botellón which is, in fact, no more than one of the expressions to describe drinking alcohol in the nighttime recreational spaces at the weekend. It is of some concern that, in conjunction with a leading position in the use of illegal drugs, Spain is also so rapidly incorporating this pattern of alcohol consumption, and one that has never formed part of our traditions. However, it does not appear that these issues are a priority for Spanish society, as has been confirmed by sociological surveys, and by the way in which the law intended to regulate alcohol consumption by minors was recently withdrawn. Diverse aspects must be taken into account if we wish to see a reversal in the current situation: the active role of the alcohol and recreation industries, the overall passive role of the professionals in alcohol and drugs in public debate, lack of determination by the authorities, the discourse in the media, the difficulty that the adult world has of taking up a position on these behaviours. Failure in not starting to act now will make it all more difficult in the future.",

Marijuana is an illicit drug that is becoming commonly used among youths and young adults and is detrimental to the human health. This review addresses the questions that most people have about the use and the effects of marijuana on the human health. The review focuses on the effects and its seriousness, affecting physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral changes to the human existence. Most of the findings in this review were based upon studies done recently in the United States of America. This review shows that that the most commonly used illicit drug (marijuana) contains an active chemical called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which causes the mind-altering effects. When marijuana is smoked, its active ingredient, THC, travels throughout the body, including the brain, to produce its many effects. THC attaches to sites called cannabinoid receptors on nerve cells in the brain, affecting the way those cells function. The questions addressed include: \"Is there treatments for marijuana abusers?\"; and \"Can marijuana be used as some forms of medication to human?\".",

      "abstract": "The recent attempt to poison Ukrainian President, Viktor Yuschenko with dioxins, raised public concern regarding this toxic chemical. In industrial countries, there is a constitutive exposure of humans to dioxin compounds, which are formed as by-products in manufacturing processes of various chlorinated organic chemicals and in waste incinerators. Dioxins are extremely stable in the environment and have a low turnover rate in the body--sometimes they are detected years after the original exposure. Of the dioxins, the most notoriously famous is the TCDD (2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). Dioxins exhibit high acute toxicity in various animal species. Humans, however, are considered less susceptible and so far there were no reported deaths following acute dioxin poisoning. Nevertheless, numerous adverse health effects are attributed to dioxin exposure. The most prominent is the chloracne--an acute acneiform eruption, usually appearing on facial skin. There is a solid evidence base that some dioxins are carcinogens. Other long-term deleterious effects of dioxin include: immunosuppression, effects on reproduction, impairments in developmental, neurological and cognitive functions in infants, increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and various hormonal alterations. The action of dioxins resembles that of hormones, since their toxicity is mostly receptor-mediated. Dioxins manifest their toxicity in extremely low concentrations. Although there are compounds that exhibit their biological activity at even lower dose range (e.g. nerve gases), this potency of dioxins is considered extraordinary, since there is an every-day exposure to dioxins through environmental vectors mostly via the food chain. Until now, there is no antidotal cure for dioxins, but only symptomatic treatment combined with techniques that accelerate its excretion rate from the body.",

However, learner nurses experienced higher stress for the greater part of their first year of training and this was one factor contributing to the consolidation of smoking among them. In general, smoking was seen as a way of dealing with negative feelings and although smokers did not experience greater stress than non‐smokers, the former were more likely to feel anger. Lower levels of perceived stress were associated with moves to lesser smoking, suggesting that stress prevents smoking being given up. Some non‐smokers were vulnerable in that they both experienced higher stress and saw smoking as a solution. The use of maladaptive intrapsychic coping techniques and the absence of social support outside nursing were both associated with movements to greater smoking.",

Nicotine is a potent chemical that has powerful effects on the human body, especially when administered rapidly or at high doses. Although many of these effects are deleterious, others may be beneficial. In certain special populations, such as the developing fetus, or persons with significant cardiovascular disease, nicotine has greater adverse effects.

Namun di sisi lain disalah gunakan atau digunakan tidak sesuai dengan standar pengobatan yang dapat menimbulkan akibat yang sangat merugikan bagi perseorangan atau masyarakat khususnya generasi muda, terlebih saat ini Maraknya peredaran narkotika yang melibatkan perempuan sebagai perantara narkotika merupakan permasalahan yang perlu mendapatkan perhatian serius baik dari pemerintah, penegak hukum dan masyarakat, karena perempuan pada umumnya sebagai makhluk yang lemah yang gampang untuk diperdaya perempuan bisa diperdaya bisa melalui berbagai cara, salah satunya yaitu dijadikan pacar untuk dijadikan perantara tinndak pidana narkotika, walaupun demikian perempuan harus tetap memperoleh perlindungan hukum yaitu mendapatkan hak-haknya sebagai warga negara Indonesia, banyak sekali alasan perantara narkotika khususnya perempuan jika sudah tertangkap oleh aparat hukum ada dari karena faktor ekonomi, lingkungan maupun keluarga, namun yang masih sering dan banyak terjadi disebabkan oleh faktor ekonomi yang mana perempuan melakukannya karena tuntutan ekonomi yang dia harus mencukupi kebutuhan ekonomi keluarganya belum lagi jika dia mempunyai anak yang masih kecil yang butuh kasih sayang dan kebutuhan yang harus dipenuhi, namun seorang perempuan jika tertangkap karena menjadi perantara narkotika bisa mendapatkan perlindungan hukum atau keringanan hukum apabila dia mengakui perbuatannya, menyesali perbuatannya dan berjanji untuk tidak melakukannya lagi.",

      "abstract": "Diseases can have a variety of causes, but a major cause is health-risk behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor nutrition, lack of physical exercise, risky sexual practices, and ignoring preventive health screenings. Moreover, many people try to cope with stress by regulating their emotions through health-impairing activities. For example, they might attempt to calm down by smoking or taking drugs. People often distract themselves from stressful encounters by resorting to behaviors that may alleviate discomfort in the short run, but at the expense of health in the long run. Public health efforts continually aim to reduce risk behaviors, which has produced some progress in this regard. There are many reasons – some personal, others social – why risk behaviors are attractive and persistent. Therefore, no single public health strategy can counteract them all effectively. This chapter will focus on individual determinants of behavioral change, although environmental conditions also deserve attention. A few introductory remarks will provide the context for this analysis.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco dependence is a complex phenomenon that is not fully understood. Nicotine is the main alkaloid in tobacco and the addictive compound of tobacco. It can improve both mood and cognitive functioning; these positive effects are strong reinforcements for smokers and contribute to their addiction. Opposite results also have been reported, however, and the effects of nicotine remain controversial. Recent epidemiological and empirical studies have indicated that smoking or nicotine or both may have protective effects against certain diseases. These findings have suggested that nicotine may be used as a therapeutic agent. However, because a variety of nicotinic cholinergic receptors are present in the brain, new agonist compounds may prove to be more effective than nicotine for therapeutic purposes. Studies are reviewed and the suggestion made that nicotine may prove useful as a tool to help us understand normal and pathological brain functioning.",

      "title": "Quick nic: novel smokeless nicotine products and pediatric trends",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review The development and marketing of smokeless nicotine products in recent years have become increasingly popular among adolescents. In addition to well known conventional inhaled nicotine products, noninhaled products, such as nicotine toothpicks, orbs, lozenges, strips, and more, have dangerously captivated a new youth audience. Although smokeless nicotine products may seem to be less threatening than conventional inhaled nicotine products, there are significant risks associated with the use of these products, including addiction and severe health issues. The purpose of this review is to provide up-to-date information about alternative nicotine products currently on the market that may appeal to youth, and the dangers of nicotine use for pediatric populations. Recent findings Smokeless nicotine products appeal to minors with their varying flavors and discrete packaging. These products may lead to nicotine toxicity as well as severe health problems, such as cancer, issues with reproduction, and heart attacks. Nicotine is extremely dangerous for young children; in fact, using nicotine products before the age of 18 years can lead to addiction and is linked to an increased likelihood of experimenting with stronger nicotine products or illicit drugs. The development of inconspicuous nicotine packaging has led to increasing concerns for accidental nicotine exposure and overdose in youth. Summary Greater knowledge regarding current nicotine products on the market, specifically smokeless nicotine products, will help clinicians be more aware of the dangers associated with these products. Clinicians will be better able to provide their patients and families with proper guidance to avoid nicotine addiction, further drug use, and detrimental health issues. Caregivers and medical professionals must recognize novel and inconspicuous nicotine products commonly used among youth, understand the signs of nicotine abuse and dependence, and take measures to address possible nicotine-related health risks.",

      "abstract": "Smoking has become one of the critical factors endangering human health. Under increasing personal health threats, many smokers have tried to escape from this habit. For those who want to quit smoking completely, whether adopt abrupt cessation or gradual cessation has been a controversial topic for many years. Abrupt cessation refers to quit smoking abruptly, without any nicotine intaking in the cessation period. Gradual cessation refers to quit smoking gradually, lowering the nicotine intake through the cessation period. So far, in this field, many researchers have stood with the opinion supporting the abrupt cessation, saying that abrupt cessation is effective in reducing smoking behavior and the chance of relapse. This article reviews the existing papers, aiming to evaluate the supporting information on abrupt cessation and gradual cessation, and give out an overview of existing controversy. The result suggests that the effectiveness of abrupt cessation cannot be neglected. However, through the consideration of smokers' preferences, the severity of being addicted, and drug intervention, gradual cessation may play a more critical role.",

(2011) podemos distinguir dos tipos de dieta.La \"dieta terapéutica/medicinal\" se hace para curar los problemas físicos, energéticos y emocionales.Según Hagens y Lansky (2012) permite recibir enseñanzas de las plantas que se toman durante este proceso.Otro tipo de dieta es la \"dieta chamánica, un proceso largo que forma parte de la preparación para ser curandero (Jauregui et al., 2011).El principiante aprende las artes de la curación tomando plantas maestras, de manera que sepa sus formas de administración y cómo manejar sus efectos.Son las más complejas (López-Pavillard, 2018).En la Amazonía hay muchos lugares donde se realizan dietas (Jauregui et al., 2011;Sanz-Biset & Cañigueral, 2011).Sin embargo, también se realizan en Europa (Tresca, 2018).La investigación presentada en este capítulo fue realizada en el Centro Takiwasi, ubicado en la ciudad de Tarapoto, Departamento de San Martín, Perú.Takiwasi es una organización civil sin fines de lucro fundada en 1992 (Giove, 2002).Su objetivo principal es el tratamiento de los trastornos por consumo de sustancias (TCS), en el cual se combina la MTA con psicoterapia en el contexto de una comunidad terapéutica (Mabit, 2007).Las dietas representan una parte esencial de este modelo terapéutico (Horák, 2020).Takiwasi ofrece dietas también para personas sin TCS [i.e.pacientes ambulatorios] en un retiro de ocho días.Desde 1996 más de 1900 personas de diferentes países del mundo (por ej.Francia, Perú, Argentina, Chile) han participado en ellas.El proceso de la dieta empieza con la toma de una planta purgativa.El propósito de la purga es la desintoxicación (Kavenská, 2013).Al día siguiente se organiza una ceremonia de ayahuasca (Politi et al., 2018).La ayahuasca es el elemento central de la MTA (Mabit et al., 1992).Está compuesta por, al menos, dos plantas, la liana ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis caapi) y la chacruna (Psychotria viridis) (Giove, 2002).Su efecto es doble.Sin que acontezca de una forma secuencial cronológicamente, encontramos el efecto emético y el estado expandido de conciencia (Metzner, 2014).",

      "title": "The Effects of Nicotine on Cardiac Function and Structure",
      "abstract": "Nicotine is the addictive chemical in tobacco‐related products, such as cigarettes, water pipes, e‐cigs, and chewing tobacco. While the effects of smoke from cigarettes and cigars are well known, the rise in popularity of smokeless electronic cigarettes (e‐cigs) brings new questions about the effects of nicotine itself on the development of cardiovascular disease. These “smoke‐less” products have grown in popularity due to reduced costs, increased social acceptance, and a belief that e‐cigs are a less dangerous alternative to smoking. Nicotine use is associated with hypertension and may activate the renin‐angiotensin system when inhaled. The renin‐angiotensin system regulates blood pressure, and a major component of the system, angiotensin‐II (Ang‐II), can cause cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. However, most animal studies administer nicotine via infusion, and very little is known about the effects of chronically inhaled nicotine. Thus the goal of our study is to investigate the effects of chronic inhaled nicotine on cardiac function and structure. C57BL/6 male mice aged 8–12 weeks were used in this study. Mice were exposed to nicotine vapor in their home cage using an exposure system that provides control of chronicity and nicotine dosing. Mice were exposed for 12 hours/day corresponding with the dark cycle. Following 4 weeks of either nicotine or air exposure, subsets of these groups were implanted with osmotic mini‐pumps containing Ang‐II to induce hypertrophy and fibrosis. Cardiac function was assessed by ultrasound echocardiography and tissue samples collected for protein and mRNA analysis. While there was no significant change in left ventricular function, we found that nicotine blunted Ang‐II mediated hypertrophy in the posterior wall (0.83 ± 0.03 mm, n=19) compared to Ang‐II exposed mice (0.93 ± 0.02 mm, n=19, p&lt; 0.01). While there were no differences in collagen 1 and 3 mRNA expression between groups, our preliminary data showed an increase in collagen I protein expression in nicotine exposed mice compared to air controls (1.27 ± 0.05 vs. 1 ± 0.09, n=2–3 respectively). In conclusion, while nicotine does not appear to affect left ventricular cardiac function, nicotine does blunt Ang‐II mediated hypertrophy. In addition, there is also evidence for increased cardiac collagen deposition in nicotine exposed mice. Future studies to measure right ventricular function, cardiomyocyte size, hypertrophic pathways, and cardiac fibroblast activity are in progress.

This study investigates vaping's impact on chronic wound healing, emphasizing e-cigarette chemical components. E-cigarettes contain common constituents: 1) Base liquids: Propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG), 2) Nicotine, 3) Flavoring chemicals and additives, 4) Trace contaminants and toxins. Chronic wounds exhibit persistent inflammation, impaired proliferation, delayed remodeling, and environmental factors (e.g., ischemia, infection, trauma). E-cigarette components impair wound healing: VG induces osmotic effects and cellular toxicity, nicotine causes vasoconstriction, reduced oxygenation, and impaired angiogenesis. Flavoring chemicals contribute to cytotoxicity and modulate inflammatory responses, while contaminants like heavy metals induce oxidative stress and inflammation. Despite e-cigarettes' lower harm compared to traditional cigarettes, their effects on chronic wound healing remain poorly understood. Further research is essential to elucidate smoking's precise impact on chronic wound healing.",

      "abstract": "Psychological maladjustments often account for both the start and preservation of obesity. Although this concept is generally accepted, its obverse has received little attention. What happens to a person attempting successful and permanent weight loss? As he sheds excess weight by dieting, does he also change his selfimage? Will he experience psychological changes in self-image, which afford him the opportunity to work through his feelings, and thereby support the weight-reduction program? Is successful coping with weight loss similar to the coping with other losses, such as loss of a leg? Silverstone categorizes obese persons into three psychological groups: maturity onset obesity, reactive obesity, and early onset neurotic obesity (). Silverstone defines maturity onset as obesity that begins in adult years -about age 30-from decreasing, activity associated with aging without a compensatory decrease in caloric intake. Silverstone estimates that two thirds of the obese are in this category and two thirds of his study sample of 187 obese people apparently belonged in this group. These people keep their former eating patterns despite the reduced physiological need for food and seem to have little psychological dis-",

Nicotine is one of the main components of cigarettes that can produce nicotinic interactions with antipsychotic drugs. Nicotine can also alleviate psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Aim: The objective for this systematic review is to examine the effects of nicotine and nicotine-based products in the treatment of schizophrenia, in comparison with placebo, no treatment or antipsychotic medication. Results: All studies comparing nicotine or other related products as the only treatment or adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia patients excluding the animal studies and case studies are reviewed. The use of traditional or known as typical antipsychotics may cause the patients to smoke frequently while patients taking atypical antipsychotics may smoke less. Patients who smoke may metabolize antipsychotics faster than non-smoking patients. There is less report related to smoking cessation among the schizophrenia patients. Conclusion: Neurobiological and psychosocial factors reinforce the high use of nicotine by patients with schizophrenia. Prior to smoking cessation implementation, it is crucial to understand on the ways and reasons for schizophrenia patients to consume nicotine for self-medicate symptoms which may lead to the development of new treatments for schizophrenia and nicotine dependence.

      "abstract": "O alcool e uma substância que esta inserida na sociedade desde os primordios, fazendo parte de muitas culturas no mundo inteiro. Por conta disso observa-se uma ingestao excessiva de bebidas alcoolicas acarretando em um conjunto de problemas. Alcoolismo e um transtorno caracterizado pelo uso cronico e excessivo de alcool, ocasionando problemas psicologicos, sociais, economicos e medicos. E seus primeiros sintomas surgem como pequenos sinais de abstinencia, como tremores, ansiedade, irritabilidade, dentre outros, tendo como suas etapas o abuso, a tolerância e a dependencia alcoolica. No Brasil, o indice de alcoolismo e uso abusivo de alcool entre maiores de 18 anos chega a 20%. O tratamento farmacoterapeutico, de acordo com o Food and Drug Administration (FDA), aprova tres farmacos para a dependencia do alcool: acamprosato, dissulfiram e naltrexona. Junto com outras estrategias com varios profissionais inseridos no processo de tratamento aos pacientes, agindo para diminuir as forcas que os fatores exercem sobre o alcoolatra e consequentemente suas recaidas. Diante disto, este trabalho tem como objetivo verificar o tratamento farmacologico para dependencia alcoolica. O presente estudo sera submetido ao Comite de Etica em Pesquisa do Centro Universitario Catolica de Quixada, atraves da Plataforma Brasil para ser avaliado para aprovacao. Trata-se de uma pesquisa observacional, analitico, transversal, com a abordagem quantitativa. A pesquisa e a coleta de dados serao realizadas no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Alcool e Drogas, localizado no municipio de Quixada – CE, no periodo de agosto de 2018 a abril de 2019, onde sera investigado o perfil sociodemografico, os farmacos utilizados, o tempo de uso e possiveis estrategicas de combate ao uso do alcool. Os dados serao coletados atraves dos formularios e inseridos no banco de dados do Microsoft Excel, 2010, para propiciar o processo e analise das respostas obtidas. Desta forma, sabendo que o alcool causa alteracoes fisiologicas, destaca-se a importância deste estudo para analisar a farmacoterapia usada no alcoolismo.",

Relighting cigarettes was positively associated with severity of smoking addiction, as well as with being female, with markers of lower socioeconomic status (income, employment status), and with having less education. Smokers contemplating change were less likely to relight cigarettes.

Les prises occasionnelles et festives, sans consequences nefastes dans la majorite des cas, pourront cependant occasionner des troubles du comportement parfois mortels. Des usages plus reguliers peuvent etre sous-tendus par un mal-etre. Dans ces cas, les prises sont souvent un moyen de trouver un refuge, de modifier et rendre plus supportable une atmosphere stressante, voire de supprimer toutes pensees douloureuses. Enfin, un certain nombre de jeunes, les plus fragiles, entreront dans la dependance, passant des simples essais en groupe a des prises quotidiennes, massives et irrepressibles. Les prises en charge devront bien entendu tenir compte de ces multiples contextes. Chaque groupe doit beneficier d’un programme adapte, chaque individu etre suivi de maniere personnalisee.A l’adolescence, l’experimentation et le renforcement des consommations se font parallelement au developpement scolaire, social et familial du jeune, l’un interferant sur l’autre. L’adolescence est une periode critique pour l’apprentissage scolaire, la gestion du stress et des emotions et l’integration des liens d’adulte a adulte. Les conduites addictives a cette periode de la vie pourront alterer l’acquisition de ces competences et entrainer une veritable « perte de chance » pour l’avenir.

In the past years, the pharmacological and behavioural effects of alcohol, such us sedation, memory and learning impairment, were assigned to the main component of alcoholic drinks, ethanol. Recently acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, seems to exert biological activity, besides its adverse effects. The aim of the present review is to elucidate the putative role of acetaldehyde in mediating the neuronal and behavioural features induced by ethanol intake.",

      "title": "The prevention of stimulant misuse",
      "abstract": "Abstract The term ‘stimulant’ refers to a class of drugs that increase psychophysiological arousal. From the viewpoint of prevention, it is more useful to look primarily at the social consequences and functions of stimulants. Every society has a documented use of stimulants. When planning interventions the dynamics of use must be placed in the foreground. Stimulant epidemics, like problematic stimulant users, have a natural tendency to burn themselves out. Different types of stimulants may differ in their origins, but their epidemiological consequences and use functions tend to be similar. Implications for prevention can be drawn from the characteristics of stimulant use epidemics. Users at risk for socially unacceptable patterns should be targeted for prevention efforts. Mass media campaigns that single out stimulants should be avoided. Much of the harm associated with stimulants is a consequence of life‐styles characterized by polydrug use and unhealthy practices. Prevention should be timed to the appropriate period of the epidemic. Interventions useful at period I will not work at period 2. The recommendations of the WHO Advisory Group on the Adverse Effects of Cocaine and Coca provide a good model for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention for all forms of stimulant misuse. Stimulant prevention must be creative in finding ways of encouraging the movements of the drug to the periphery of users’lives.",

      "abstract": "A review is presented of the effects of alcohol and licit drugs on performance related to driving. About 20% of persons of driving age use some licit drug, while a much greater percentage drink alcohol. Alcohol is used in combination with another licit drug by about 10% of persons of driving age. Alcohol is associated with about 50% of fatal traffic accidents, 30% of injury accidents and 10% of non-injury accidents. Other licit drugs, such as diazepam, are involved in about 20% of non-fatal accidents. Alcohol combined with other licit drugs, such as diazepam, is involved in about 10% of injury accidents. The effects of alcohol on driving-related skills is relatively well-documented, but tests on the effects of other licit drugs present variable findings. There is some research which indicates additive or synergistic effects when alcohol is combined with other drugs. Research to date on the effects of licit drugs alone, and in combination with alcohol, has many limitations. There have been comparatively few studies to test decision-making and perceptual-motor skills, such as used in driving or those involving actual driving tasks. However, studies indicate that when combined with alcohol, some licit drugs lead to a deterioration in driving-related performance, but a need exists for further research involving more complex driving-related tests and actual driving situations.",

The drug consumption handled as the taboo long ago, but it became focused burst into the public consciousness, the wide publicity got in front of it suddenly, and that's the reason why the goverment needs steps against it bigger, more precise and requests more concerted social work.

The electronic cigarette is a battery-powered electronic nicotine delivery system that looks very similar to a conventional cigarette and is capable of emulating smoking, but without the combustion products accountable for smoking's damaging effects. Smokers who decide to switch to electronic cigarettes instead of continuing to smoke would achieve large health gains. The electronic cigarette is an emerging phenomenon that is becoming increasingly popular with smokers worldwide. Users report buying them to help quit smoking, to reduce cigarette consumption, to relieve tobacco withdrawal symptoms due to workplace smoking restrictions and to continue to have a 'smoking' experience but with reduced health risks. The focus of the present article is the health effects of using electronic cigarettes, with consideration given to the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of this product to serve as a long-term substitute for smoking or as a tool for smoking cessation.",

Dr. Cappon's psychoanalytic background and extensive experience in treating both obesity and cachexia make for an interesting and well-crafted approach to a familiar problem. One current research trend is to lump total drug and food abuse into the category of<i>substance abuse</i>. This concept can give the physician options of perceiving important similarities between obesity, alcoholism, and heroin addiction. All forms of substance abuse have in common two features: (1) an imbalance in the metabolism or utilization of the substance, and (2) lack of proper exercise and mind-body balance that choice forms of corrective exercise may help to induce. <i>Eating,</i>",

From all this it is clear that prolonged consumption of alcohol causes numerous damages throughout the body. Alcoholism is a long-term and chronic illness, and an alcoholic is a person who has become physically and mentally addicted to long-term drinking. Many physical and mental disabilities develop as a result of addiction, and social difficulties occur. Current inebriation and alcoholism should be differentiate.

Efforts to change smokers' behavior usually reach a point of diminishing returns, as evidenced by experiences in smoking withdrawal clinics and in public anti-smoking education campaigns. Obviously, many smokers are refactory to anti-smoking education, a situation which has generated a great deal of pharmacological, neurochemical, psychological, and sociological research. The National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health in the U.S.A. has used a \"gradualist\" or permissive approach in anti-smoking messages, aimed at less hazardous smoking \"if you must smoke,\" rather than at complete cessation, and found this approach to be useful. U.S.A. school-children are exposed to anti-smoking education in lower grades than formerly, when it was offered in high school. Thus a population of as yet non-smoking children is being educated. Perhaps the adult non-smokers should be enlisted in an effort to create a social climate wherein smoking is not an acceptable behavior-an approach reflecting the concept of smoking as a social disease. Health education addressed to the receptive non-smoker would circumvent the refractory smoker. A theme with appeal to non-smokers is the protest against environmental pollution by smokers. It is possible that if a movement by non-smokers against smoking would gather momentum, it could turn the present accepting social climate into one rejecting smoking, thus striking at the regeneration of the Hydra: the incessant recruitment of smokers among ex-smokers and non-smokers. With recruitment below replacement level, the Hydra would in time wither away.",

      "title": "Nutritional Support for Exercise-Induced Injuries",
      "abstract": "Nutrition is one method to counter the negative impact of an exercise-induced injury. Deficiencies of energy, protein and other nutrients should be avoided. Claims for the effectiveness of many other nutrients following injuries are rampant, but the evidence is equivocal. The results of an exercise-induced injury may vary widely depending on the nature of the injury and severity. Injuries typically result in cessation, or at least a reduction, in participation in sport and decreased physical activity. Limb immobility may be necessary with some injuries, contributing to reduced activity and training. Following an injury, an inflammatory response is initiated and while excess inflammation may be harmful, given the importance of the inflammatory process for wound healing, attempting to drastically reduce inflammation may not be ideal for optimal recovery. Injuries severe enough for immobilization of a limb result in loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle strength and function. Loss of muscle results from reductions in basal muscle protein synthesis and the resistance of muscle to anabolic stimulation. Energy balance is critical. Higher protein intakes (2–2.5 g/kg/day) seem to be warranted during immobilization. At the very least, care should be taken not to reduce the absolute amount of protein intake when energy intake is reduced. There is promising, albeit preliminary, evidence for the use of omega-3 fatty acids and creatine to counter muscle loss and enhance hypertrophy, respectively. The overriding nutritional recommendation for injured exercisers should be to consume a well-balanced diet based on whole, minimally processed foods or ingredients made from whole foods. The diet composition should be carefully assessed and changes considered as the injury heals and activity patterns change.",

      "title": "Alcohol: Reducing the Harm",
      "abstract": "Produced easily by fermentation, ethyl alcohol has for at least 5 to 8 thousand years played a part in the development of human civilisation; as a medicine, as a substance endowed with religious significance, as a food and important element in many cuisines, as a fuel, as an economic good and as a disinhibiting/intoxicating drug used to aid social intercourse. It is in this last context that alcohol is most widely employed in the modern world. With the main exception of Muslim societies it is generally accepted as a legal 'social psychotropic' for adult use, that is as a self-purchased and self-administered substance taken by healthy individuals primarily for its mind affecting properties. Even in Britain, still one of the more sober of the developed nations despite a virtual doubling of per capita alcohol intake in the last quarter of a century, the scale of ethyl alcohol consumption can be seen to be enormous if compared to, for instance, that of medically legitimated drugs/medicines. The most frequently prescribed group of the latter substances are the benzodiazapine tranquillisers and hypnotics, some 30 million scripts for which were filled in 1979. The cost to the NHS (£1979) was a little over £30 million. In the same year the British population drank 40 million proof gallons of spirits, 1,500 million gallons of beer and 100 million gallons of wine. This is equivalent to over 17 pints of absolute (pure) alcohol for every individual aged over 15 in the country. The cost (£1979) to the public was almost £9,000 million. The use of any pharmacologically active substance to such a degree is likely to be associated with some forms of harm. In the case of 'drinking' these include mortality and morbidity from conditions like alcohol related liver diseases and peptic ulcers, the results of driving whilst intoxicated and the many economic and social burdens which may be inflicted on an individual and/or his or her family as a consequence of alcohol dependence. These factors are difficult to quantify accurately, but broad indicators include the estimate that the number of premature deaths associated with alcohol use in Britain is probably in the order of 5,000 to 10,000 per annum and official claims that between 500,000 and 750,000 people in England and Wales alone have some form of serious drink related problem. Even excluding intangible costs of suffering, government economists have recently suggested that the unwanted effects of alcohol consumption may lose the nation around £1,000 million (£1981) a year. Against this, of course, have to be balanced the desirable aspects of alcohol use. In an ideal world, it could be argued, scientifically acceptable techniques for quantifying the value of drinking and its linked costs would be developed and a policy for influencing alcohol use in the community aimed at optimising the welfare balance introduced. Much concern has been expressed to the effect that recent British policy has failed to control adequately the level of alcohol related harm. For example, an unpublished but widely seen report from the government's Central Policy Review Staff urged policy makers to introduce, on health grounds, increased taxes on alcoholic beverages, to encourage alcohol treatment facilities in workplaces and to amend the law to permit random breath testing for drivers. However, the barriers to establishing a rational approach to policy are significant. On the technical level, for example, the methods of quantifying the global social and economic benefits of this form of drug use are still relatively immature. Whilst at the political level, debate and decision making may be influenced by a number of powerful and conflicting interests. These include, first, those of the brewers, distillers and purveyors of alcohol beverages, who do not only contribute to the UK economy by providing up to 700,000 jobs but also export large quantities (about £1,000 million worth) of spirits and provide the State with a significant (currently £3,500 million plus) route for revenue raising. Second, those of the medical and allied professions and the UK Health Departments, which may be genuinely striving to increase the wellbeing of the population but which might sometimes appear to be a little authoritarian or paternalistic. And, third, those sections of the population who for religious or allied reasons believe that drinking is wrong per se. Against this background this paper seeks to clarify some of the issues relating to the consumption of alcohol in Britain. It describes recent thinking regarding the processes by which harm from the dependence on alcohol are induced, the nature of alcohol as a mind affecting drug and a cause of physical disorders and the various ways in which society and individuals may be protected against its ill effects. Special attention is paid to economic factors, although a wide range of social phenomena, such as the shifting pattern of alcohol consumption amongst the female population and the interaction between the use of medicines and social drugs, are touched on. The overall objective is to help to stimulate and inform public discussion of this important area and to identify those aspects of alcohol usage where disciplined scientific research needs to be further encouraged.",

Las sustancias utilizadas en el dopaje provocan un aumento artificial del rendimiento deportivo y, al mismo tiempo, pueden llegar a desestabilizar las funciones fisiologicas del organismo en detrimento de la salud. El dopaje es un tema de actualidad por tres motivos: el gran numero de casos detectados, la sofisticacion de los metodos empleados, y su repercusion en los medios de comunicacion. No obstante, no es algo nuevo. El ser humano ha buscado, en todas las etapas de la historia, vias para mejorar su rendimiento fisico e intelectual. Es conocido como los chinos utilizaban la efedra cientos de anos antes de Cristo o los nativos de los Andes la coca. Despues se fueron introduciendo otras sustancias como la cafeina, las hormonas o la eritropoyetina. Tambien se ha buscado, en todas las etapas de la historia del deporte, la ayuda ergogenica en la alimentacion. Por ejemplo, se dice que en la Grecia clasica se intentaba mejorar los records mediante la ingesta de carne de cabra los saltadores, de toro los corredores y de cerdo los luchadores. La ultima polemica sobre dopaje es la del denominado Doping tecnologico. Ha tenido su mas reciente expresion en los trajes de bano de poliuretano de oro. Las muchas marcas mundiales que se rompieron en los Mundiales de Natacion de Roma, en el ano 2009, fueron relacionadas con la fabricacion de trajes de este material que permitia al nadador flotar con mayor facilidad. Segun Costa, las primeras referencias de dopaje en la epoca moderna se situan en el siglo XIX. “Cuando las famosas carreras de los Seis dias empezaron en 1897, los atletas de muchas naciones utilizaban distintos tipos de formulas para incrementar el rendimiento deportivo: los atletas franceses preferian mezclas de cafeina, los belgas azucar diluido en liquidos alcoholicos, y los velocistas se especializaban en la nitroglicerina.

      "abstract": "The use of mind-altering drugs other than alcohol presents a serious contemporary problem. Some people are concerned about the real effects of drugs on users, others about perceived effects which at times seem to bear little relationship to pharmacologic reality. Many are aroused primarily because they see in drug use a symptom of widespread moral and religious decay. A few are worried largely because they fear that drug users may commit acts which harm innocent nonusers. All of these concerns are important in considering the role of mindaltering drugs in the occurrence of highway crashes, because these concerns have largely determined our perception of the problem of drugs and highway crashes. At times, they have led to preventive and corrective actions that not only are inappropriate but often sap away scarce funds and effort that should be devoted to more effective solutions.

      "title": "Are e-cigarettes beneficial for public health: Hume's guillotine – The debate continues?",
      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the most common preventable cause of death which has led to a search for healthier alternatives to tobacco smoke. Electronic cigarettes are devoid of many harmful constituents found in cigarette smoke and are therefore being positioned as safer alternative to tobacco smoke. The carcinogenic potential may be of lower magnitude compared with cigarette smoke, but it is still there. The use of e-cigarettes, however, is fairly new, so its long-term effects are still unknown. Moreover, they continue to posses the cardiovascular side-effects and are certainly as addicting. Thus on one hand while their substitution could lead to reduction of some side-effects of tobacco smoke, its use may be just shifting the modality of addiction and will be unlikely to lead to total abstinence from tobacco products. On the other hand there is a fear that its use could lead to loosening of the taboo currently associated with use of tobacco products and so the benefits of years of advocacy to ban tobacco products might be lost. Thus currently the scientific community is divided about role of e-cigarettes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction and Purpose: More and more alternatives to traditional smoking are available on shop shelves. Are other ways of using nicotine healthier for us? What are the advantages and disadvantages? The aim of this article is to trace the health effects of new, popular alternatives to the traditional cigarette. Materials and methods: A literature search was conducted using the medical databases PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles were retrieved in English, employing the key words: “Iqos”, “Glo”, „ e-cigarette” and „ tobacco” appropriate configurations. Conclusions: Modern tobacco devices, such as IQOS and Glo, emit significantly less harmful substances than traditional cigarettes. In particular, emissions of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are significantly lower. Nevertheless, nicotine remains the main ingredient in these products, with serious health risks. Regular use of nicotine can lead to addiction, cardiovascular disease and problems with the nervous system and oral cavity. Inhaling aerosol from tobacco devices such as IQOS, Glo and disposable e-cigarettes can lead to damage to lung cells and other respiratory health problems. Despite the lower risks, the use of alternative smoking methods is still harmful to our health.",

People who drink moderately (1-2 drinks/day for women and 2-3 drinks/day for men) could be healthier than abstainers or heavy drinkers. The pattern of moderate drinking consists of type of drink, quantity and frequency of drinking and the status of the drinker (health profile, type of diet, other diseases, gender). Except for the pattern of moderate drinking, it is important to keep in mind the meaning of standard drinks, because they represent the serving size. The serving size of standard drink differs from country to country and it depends on grams of ethanol of each drink. According to these factors, moderate drinking benefits the health of heart and brain, but also it seems that alcohol influences the risk of obesity, the well-being and many other. Moderate drinking affects overall health through possible mechanisms, such as insulin sensitivity, levels of HDL (high density cholesterol) and LDL (low density cholesterol) and antioxidants' intake. As for now, the body of evidence has not formed the same opinion, because of the confused factors of health and the different type of researches. In conclusion, the most researches support the moderate drinking as the best drinking pattern, only if there is limit and responsibility in consumption, contributing to healthy nutrition and health.",

According to a study conducted by Johnston et al., the individual’s perceived risk and harmfulness of the drug determine usage. Risk was observed during a period of time and it can be alarming when perceived risk drops because it can have unpredictable effects on new population using ecstasy/MDMA. One of the highest predictors found if a young adult would participate in the use of ecstasy is the association with other ecstasy users and the types of events attended.\r\nPopularity of ecstasy/MDMA does not have a consistent measure of popularity since it is often changing and each risk perceived is effective to drops in popularity as well as when the risk is not seen as a big issue. During a longitudinal study Johnston et al. was able to see that while one year of high school students could have negative perceptions of a drug others could be exempt and would affect just those years of students.\r\nOne popular predictor found by Smirnov et al. was that much ecstasy use occurred under a specific type of music culture which was mainly electronic music and dance music in clubs as opposed to a diminished amount in places where there was live music. This shows that the social environment has a deep influence on the frequency that the drug is offered on individuals. This is because the basic perception of the drug is associated to be part of the electronic music scene.",

Specialists have tried to pinpoint factors like biological science, sex, race, or socioeconomics which will dispose somebody to white plague. however it's no single cause. Psychological, genetic, and behavioural factors will all contribute to having the sickness. It’s necessary to notice that alcoholism may be a real sickness. It will cause changes to the brain and neurochemistry, thus someone with Associate in Nursing white plague might not be ready to management their actions. white plague will show itself in a very type of ways in which. The severity of the sickness, however usually somebody drinks, and also the alcohol they consume varies from person to person. Some individuals drink heavily all day, whereas others binge drink then keep sober for a jiffy. notwithstanding however the addiction appearance, somebody generally has Associate in Nursing white plague if they heavily believe drinking Associate in Nursingd can’t keep sober for an extended amount of your time. Alcohol addiction is troublesome to acknowledge. In contrast to cocain or hard drug, alcohol is wide out there and accepted in several cultures. It’s usually at the middle of social things and closely coupled to celebrations and pleasure. Drinking may be a a part of life for several individuals. once is it common in society, it is exhausting to inform the distinction between somebody United Nations agency likes to possess some drinks currently then and somebody with a true downside. Some symptoms of white plague are: increased amount or frequency of use, high tolerance for alcohol, or lack of “hangover” symptoms, drinking at inappropriate times, like very first thing within the morning, or in places like church or work, desperate to be wherever alcohol is gift and avoiding things wherever there's none, changes in friendships; somebody with Associate in Nursing white plague could select friends United Nations agency additionally drink heavily, avoiding contact with fair-haired ones, activity alcohol, or activity whereas drinking, dependence on alcohol to perform in existence, increased lethargy, depression, or different emotional problems, legal or skilled issues like Associate in Nursing arrest or loss of employment.

It's currently proverbial that excess alcohol consumption throughout gestation will cause foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) during which many characteristic craniofacial abnormalities square measure usually visible. However, the molecular mechanisms of however excess ethyl alcohol exposure affects os Neural Crest Cells (CNCCs), the ascendant cells of the os skeleton, continues to be not clear. Within the study, we tend to investigated the results of ethyl alcohol exposure on CNCCs migration each in early chick embryo and in vitro explant culture. 1st of all, we tend to incontestible that ethyl alcohol treatment caused alizarine red-stained craniofacial organic process defects together with membrane bone defect. Second, immunofluorescent staining with neural crest special markers indicated that CNCCs generation was smothered by ethyl alcohol exposure. Double immunofluorescent stainings (Ap-2/PHIS3, HNK1/BrdU and AP-2?/c-caspase3) disclosed that ethyl alcohol exposure smothered CNCCs proliferation and increased cell death. additionally, it smothered NCCs production by restrictive the expression level of key transcription factors that regulate neural crest development by fixing expression of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-related adhesion molecules within the developing neural crests. In sum, we've provided experimental proof that excess ethyl alcohol exposure throughout embryogenesis disrupts CNCCs survival, EMT and migration, that successively causes defective of bone development. Treating white plague is complicated and difficult. So as for treatment to figure, the person with Associate in nursing white plague should wish to urge sober. You can’t force them to prevent drinking if they aren’t prepared. Success depends on the person’s want to urge higher. The recovery method for alcoholism may be a lifespan commitment.

Existem evidências sugerindo que a exposição dos componentes presentes na Cannabis em idades mais jovens, principalmente na adolescência, somado aos fatores familiares e genéticos estão diretamente associados ao desenvolvimento de psicoses. Além disso, a produção de linhagens da planta com alta concentração de delta-9-tetrahidrocanabinol (THC) pode apresentar um grande risco para a saúde mental geral, uma vez que elas são mais potentes, gerando efeitos em maiores proporções.

      "title": "Energy Drink Use in Sport: All Risk, No Gain",
      "abstract": "“Deaths linked to energy drinks” has become a sad and all too frequent headline in recent years. The rise in energy drink use in the sporting world has been exponential as few products have inserted themselves into athlete's lives the way that caffeine-laden energy drinks have over the last 30 years. What began as a novel way to party through the night has become a mainstay of athletic preparation for a large portion of active adolescents and young adults who are seeking some magical performance edge. On the surface, this sounds reasonable until we consider that energy drinks have a number of crucial flaws. The simple fact is that energy drinks fail to provide their implied value for most consumers, and they contain one or multiple ingredients that may place athletes in peril for adverse outcomes, including death. It is time for the sports medicine community to take a stronger stand on the use of energy drinks if we are to be true to our mission to safeguard the health and well-being of our athletic population. Energy drinks and energy “shots” are nonalcoholic beverages typically comprised of solutions of sugar and carbohydrate, moderate to high amounts of caffeine, and a variety of other proprietary chemicals touted to have energy-giving properties. Though their marketing often focuses on these other chemicals, most notably taurine, glucuronolactone, guarana, yerba mate, and even ephedra, at their core, energy drinks are just cleverly crafted vehicles for sizable quantities of caffeine. Because the FDA considers them supplement products and not foods, energy drinks and shots are not held to the same caffeine limits used for standard beverages. This allows manufacturers to produce them with far higher caffeine concentrations than would be acceptable for soda or coffee, and this lack of regulation clearly contributes to the risk for misuse. Standard 8-oz. energy drinks contain 80 mg to 100 mg of caffeine (a large cup of coffee may contain 200+ mg) while “shots” may contain nearly 200 mg of caffeine in only 2 oz. Though product labels do accurately reflect the synthetic alkaloid caffeine content of these drinks, many of the natural additives, most notably guarana and yerba mate, are powerful natural sources of caffeine that are not included in the labeled total. The end result is a product with a far higher caffeine concentration than even the savvy consumer could reasonably determine. So is there justification for the sports world's obsession with caffeine and related stimulant products? Caffeine has long been heralded as a performance-enhancing chemical, but exercise physiology studies to date have shown caffeine to have limited to no value for sport. Moderate caffeine consumption in the range of 3 to 6 mg·kg−1 has been shown to have a positive impact on performance but only in trained athletes during sustained maximal endurance exercise. No value has been consistently proven for short-burst or power activities, resistance exercise, or with consumption of 9 mg·kg−1 or higher. This lack of proven efficacy is ironic in light of the fact that energy drink use is highly associated with the desire to “amp up” a gym workout or power lifting session where caffeine has no proven ergogenic value. They also are widely consumed in the precompetition time frame as a means of increasing energy or intensity for sport but, again, the data do not support value in those settings either. For most, caffeine intake enhances the perception of athletic prowess but fails to deliver the physiologic value to justify its use. All risk, and no gain. And the risks are substantial. Considering the widespread use of stimulant products, it is no surprise that there have been an alarming number of case reports of significant adverse reactions in association with energy drink consumption. Visits to emergency rooms and calls to poison control centers relating to excessive caffeine or stimulant intake are increasing each year. Tragically, energy drink consumption has been associated with cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, spontaneous coronary dissection, coronary vasospasm, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Other serious adverse effects have included seizures, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, acute psychosis, and high risk/aggressive behavior. These adverse events often result from a “perfect storm” of physiologic factors coming together, the foundation of which is generally an undiagnosed underlying medical condition which becomes manifest when sufficient exacerbating factors are present. In these energy drink cases, the effects of caffeine and other stimulants, coupled with the stresses of sport-elevated heart rate and blood pressure, dehydration, heat stress, and other ingested substances, especially psychostimulants — may precipitate a serious or even lethal event. It is important to note that these risks are even greater in adolescents who often have limited tolerance to caffeine due to infrequent consumption. As a result, younger athletes are more subject to complications, particularly when consuming large and rapid doses of caffeine present in energy drinks, especially in combination with exercise. Concerning trends in the use and misuse of energy drinks can be traced to the obvious appeal generated through aggressive advertising and implied claims of sport benefit. Young, impressionable athletes are inherent risk takers and are increasingly seeking whatever advantage they can gain to augment their sport performance. Energy drink consumption then becomes an accepted part of their athletic preparation because of the inaccurate sense that these products provide a physiologic boost that cannot be obtained without them. These beliefs are further fueled by clever and often deceptive marketing to this vulnerable population. Bright, colorful packaging with a variety of powerful images and enticing names lure athletes with their implied benefits of enhanced athletic performance and boundless energy. Sponsorships of prominent sports teams and major sporting events only deepen the association between energy drinks and visions of athletic success. Unfortunately, there are no safeguards in place to desensationalize these products and their purported athletic value. Products with legitimate athletic value should be safe and should stand on their physiologic properties alone; energy drinks simply do not. So, what are we as a group to do? The sports medicine community owes it to our athletes and active patients to stand up against the rampant and uncontrolled use of energy products. We must be on the front lines of efforts to change the trajectory of this societal trend. All sports medicine providers need to be vocal in our educational efforts for prudent use and to ensure that every athlete knows what the risks and benefits, if any, are from stimulant products that they may be consuming. We need to reiterate again and again that caffeine and its related stimulant chemicals have little to no value to the vast majority of athletes, but the risks extend to everyone who consumes them. Pressure must be applied to compel manufacturers to market their products in a fair and unbiased way with a focus on scientific fact rather than unfounded hype and profit motive, and they should be prevented from targeting vulnerable populations who stand to be harmed the most by energy drink use. Manufacturers also should be required to fairly represent what they know about the potentially harmful effects of their products and clearly provide point of sale information to help consumers make choices appropriate to their athletic or activity goals. The FDA should classify all energy drinks as foods, rather than supplements, so that they will be held to the same caffeine concentration standards as soda and related drinks. Finally, much research is needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy of this group of products; we have really only scratched the surface. If athletes are going to use energy drinks and related products, they need guidance in product choice, caffeine amount, prudence of use for a given athletic endeavor, and avoidance of accidental or intentional overuse. We as sports medicine providers are in a unique position to meet these needs. Our consistent message must be that athletic feats are achieved through hard work and optimal lifestyle management. Energy drinks are a hazardous shortcut that only puts athletes in harm's way. All risk, no gain.",

      "title": "O uso nocivo de crack: percepções de pessoas em tratamento da dependência",
      "abstract": "O uso de drogas sempre permeou a existencia humana, sendo visto em determinados grupos sociais como um comportamento natural uma vez que alivia dores e sofrimentos em alguns momentos e produz estimulo e entusiasmo entre outros. A cocaina e uma das drogas cujo consumo tem crescido nos ultimos anos na America do Sul, e em especial no Brasil, sendo uma de suas apresentacoes, o crack a mais consumida. Essa droga ilicita, estimulante do sistema nervoso central, muitas vezes leva a pessoa dependente a ter prejuizos no âmbito fisico, economico e social. O isolamento ao qual a pessoa dependente do crack esta exposta configura-se em situacao extrema de vulnerabilidade social que se expoem a consequencias de uma conjuntura social maior e mais abrangente que transcende o ato de usar a droga. O objetivo deste estudo foi compreender os significados do uso nocivo de crack por pessoas em tratamento da dependencia. Pesquisa social de abordagem qualitativa, na modalidade estrategica realizada em um hospital psiquiatrico com 39 participantes distribuidos em oito grupos focais. Foi realizada observacao do campo com registros em diario de campo. As reunioes foram gravadas e posteriormente transcritas e analisadas por meio do metodo de interpretacao de sentidos. Emergiram tres categorias tematicas que foram discutidas a luz teorica da vulnerabilidade social proposta por Robert Castel. A primeira, “descoberta do crack e outras drogas” descreve as motivacoes para o uso e diferencia a experimentacao do crack com o de outras drogas. As motivacoes citadas foram a curiosidade, excesso de liberdade dos pais e alivio para alguma decepcao da vida e, tambem a influencia de amigos. A categoria “dor do prazer” descreve o momento apos experimentacao do crack quando se instala a dependencia, levando a um ciclo de periodos curtos de tentativa de abstinencia, recaida e consumo incessante. Em suas falas, embora o crack tenha sido considerado a droga que, paradoxalmente, proporciona prazer e alivio aos sofrimentos, leva ao consumo desenfreado, fissura incontrolavel, prejuizos no trabalho, venda de bens e afastamento da familia, conflito com traficantes e policiais, independentemente, nesse estudo, de poder aquisitivo. Por ultimo, na categoria “retomar a vida” os participantes descrevem o desejo de mudanca de vida apos chegarem a uma situacao extrema de uso da droga, falta de dinheiro, conflitos em seu meio social. Apontam ainda, o sentimento de desespero por nao mais quererem usar o crack e nao serem capazes disso em virtude da dependencia. Os resultados permitiram observar que antes mesmo da dependencia do crack os participantes ja se encontravam numa situacao de vulnerabilidade social. A abordagem de pessoas em tratamento da dependencia do crack deve ser realizada no sentido de reduzir a distância entre essas pessoas e a familia, sociedade e servicos de saude, sendo esse o ponto de partida para profissionais de saude na proposicao de acoes de promocao da saude.",

Demographic, personality, psychologic, and cognitive differences were examined. Engaging in this highly detrimental health behavior was related exclusively to cognitive factors. Although current smokers were cognitively aware of their added health risk, in comparison to past and \"never\" smokers, they minimized the salience of awareness by fatalistically attributing their health to chance factors such as luck and by minimizing the dangers of smoking, the benefits of smoking cessation, and their own increased vulnerability to life-threatening illnesses. Results are explained in light of the apparent denial of risk. The need for physician intervention is strongly advocated.",

The conducted sociological survey shows that the attitude of students to smoking people is mostly negative 52 %, 30 % of respondents consider this phenomenon normal, 18 % are neutral. 100 % of Student-athletes have a negative attitude to smoking. The main reason for this need is the desire to relax, relieve tension. At the same time, everyone claims that smoking harms their health, at the same time, none of them (100 %) associate their constantly disturbing or chronic diseases with addiction to smoking. 86 % of respondents (including those who did not become smokers) tried their first cigarette on average at the age of 13-17. Despite the fact that in the circle of the surveyed students, more than 45 % of friends often use low-alcohol drinks (beer, cocktails, gin-tonics, etc.), they themselves use less often – 25%. Student-athletes use alcoholic beverages to relieve stress, celebrate victories and good results-50 %. A direct connection between a healthy lifestyle and a negative attitude to bad habits has been revealed. As a result of the conducted research, it can be argued that all students have a very negative attitude to bad habits and a positive attitude to a healthy lifestyle.",

      "title": "Rauchverhalten und Einstellungen zum Rauchverbot in der Europäischen Union. Eine komparative Analyse der 27 Mitgliedsländer der EU mit Umfragedaten des Eurobarometers",
      "abstract": "In den letzten Jahren haben sowohl die Europäische Union, als auch viele europäische Nationalstaaten ihre Anti-Tabak-Politik massiv vorangetrieben. Dies zeigt sich anhand zahlreicher Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung des Tabakkonsums, wie z.B. das Tabakwerbeverbot oder die Einführung von Rauchverboten in verschiedenen Mitgliedsländern. Doch wie sieht es auf der Ebene der Bevölkerung aus? Um diese Frage zu beantworten, werden in diesem Beitrag die Bürger der 27 Mitgliedsstaaten der EU in Bezug auf ihre Einstellungen zu Rauchverboten sowie bezüglich ihres Rauchverhaltens miteinander verglichen. Der komparative Vergleich mit Eurobarometer-Daten zeigt, dass die Akzeptanz eines Rauchverbotes vor allem in Ländern mit bestehenden Rauchverboten sehr hoch ausfällt. Bürger aus Ländern ohne ausgeprägtem Nichtraucherschutz befürworten ein Rauchverbot in weit geringerem Maße. Hinsichtlich des Rauchverhaltens findet sich in den meisten Ländern der EU ein Rückgang der Raucherprävalenzen. Ferner weisen die Länder ohne besondere Regelungen zum Nichtraucherschutz besonders hohe Raucheranteile auf. Im Anschluss werden die gefundenen Unterschiede in den Einstellungen zum Rauchverbot und im Rauchverhalten erklärt. Hierfür werden auf Grundlage der Theorie des geplanten Verhaltens von Ajzen und Fishbein Erklärungsmodelle entwickelt. Die multivariate Analyse zeigt, dass besonders die Annahmen über die Konsequenzen des Rauchverbotes, aber auch die subjektiven Normen in der Einstellung einer Person eine Rolle spielen. Im Falle des Rauchverhaltens ist vor allem die wahrgenommene Verhaltenskontrolle ein erklärungskräftiger Faktor, wobei der Einfluss der sozioökonomischen Merkmale einer Person stärker ins Gewicht fällt. Diese aus der Sozialepidemiologie abgeleiteten Variablen lassen sich jedoch als Hintergrundfaktoren in das Erklärungsmodell integrieren. Wirft man einen Blick in die Zukunft, kann man damit rechnen, dass vor allem in den EU-Ländern mit bestehenden Rauchverboten der Tabakkonsum und die Raucherprävalenzen weiter abnehmen werden. Führen auch diejenigen Länder, die bisher nur wenig im Bereich des Nichtraucherschutzes unternommen haben, ein Rauchverbot ein, kann man davon ausgehen, dass Europa zukünftig zunehmend rauchfreier werden wird.",

Included in the questions asked were questions about alcohol and amphetamine usage, hallucinations, accident history, aggressive behaviour, and exposure measures. 14.2% Of drivers admitted they often used amphetamines, with a further 26.5% Sometimes using them. 13.8% Never drank alcohol, 78.4% Drank seven or fewer drinks per day, and 5.9% More than seven drinks per day. When exposure was controlled, neither alcohol nor amphetamine use was significantly related to self reported accident involvement. However, amphetamine usage and alcohol usage were related to incidence of hallucinations, and to self reported aggression.",

      "title": "Frequency and Sequence of Drug Use: A Longitudinal Study from Early Adolescence to Young Adulthood",
      "abstract": "Although drug use has been found to be acquired in a series of stages or steps, the exact nature of this progression has not been firmly established, nor has such a process been corroborated for life periods other than adolescence. In this study, drug use data obtained from 654 adolescents were used to examine changes and sequencing of drug involvement over an eight-year period from early adolescence to young adulthood. Cannabis use peaked during late adolescence; liquor, stimulants, and nonprescription medication increased steadily over the eight-year period; hypnotics and psychedelic use increased through late adolescence and remained stable through young adulthood; and early experimental use of cigarettes decreased to more committed use over the eight-year span. In a latent variable model that did not include nonprescription drugs and cigarettes, alcohol use significantly influenced later cannabis and hard drug use, whereas cannabis use predicted later hard drug use for the earlier life period. Only the cannabis effect remained at the older age period, when drug use patterns appeared to become more stable and firmly established. However, when cigarettes and nonprescription drugs were added to the model, quite different results emerged. Based on this more comprehensive analysis, it was concluded that: There are several interrelated mini-sequences of drug involvement; cigarettes play a prominent role as a gateway to cannabis and hard drugs; and at higher levels of involvement there is a synergistic or reciprocal effect of increasing involvement. Again, the later developmental period was much more stable with somewhat different patterns of influence.",

Tobacco misuse is the leading preventable cause of premature death in the world. Smoking rates among Canadian Indigenous youth are at least three times higher than for their non-Aboriginal peers, an alarming statistic on many levels. The tolls on health from extensive tobacco use range from disproportionately high individual mortality and morbidity to heavy socioeconomic burdens on Indigenous communities. Paediatric health care providers are uniquely positioned to collaborate with community stakeholders to prevent and treat tobacco misuse in young people and their families, while understanding the cultural value of tobacco for many Indigenous peoples. Targeted interventions can positively impact length and quality of life, improve overall health and decrease the immense social and human costs of tobacco misuse.",

      "title": "The Four-Loko Effect",
      "abstract": "There have been recent reports of mass hospitalizations for alcohol intoxication following consumption of fruit-flavored, caffeinated, alcoholic drinks—especially concerning one brand in particular: Four Loko. Caffeine was quickly determined to be the culprit. In accordance with a directive by the Food and Drug Administration, caffeine was removed from Four Loko and similar beverages. However, the evidence that caffeine played a prominent role in widespread displays of intoxication is far from clear. Rather, it is likely that Four Loko-type drinks are especially effective as intoxicants because they provide alcohol in an unusual context. It has been known for many years that drug tolerance partially results from an association between drug-paired stimuli and the drug effect. When these stimuli are altered, the drug-experienced individual does not display the expected tolerant response to the drug—rather, an enhanced (i.e., nontolerant) response is seen. Four Loko and similar beverages may be especially effective intoxicants because they provide a very novel flavor context for alcohol. A recent announcement by the manufacturer of Four Loko suggests (either by design or happenstance) appreciation of the contribution of alcohol-associated cues to alcohol tolerance.",

      "abstract": "A questionnaire, administered to random samples of students on the Yale and Wesleyan campuses, revealed that one of every five students on each campus had used hallucinogenic drugs at least once in his lifetime. Marijuana was by far the most popular. There was no appreciable difference between the two campuses as to whether students had ever used it or, if so, when they first tried it, but the students from Wesleyan used it more heavily and more recently. Wesleyan students were more likely to have used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at some point and showed some tendency to have used it more recently, but did not differ significantly as to total cumulative use or the time they first tried it. For all hallucinogens, all users reported experiencing pleasant effects much more frequently than unpleasant effects. A majority of all nonusers reported knowing someone who had used hallucinogens, and a sizeable minority reported having seriously considered trying it.",

There is little doubt that these effects reinforce drinking of alcoholic beverages, play a significant role in alcohol abuse and may contribute significantly to the development of alcohol dependence. There are, however, different views about the nature of the reinforcing effects that ethanol produces. Anxiety or stress reduction has frequently been suggested as an important effect of ethanol. The anxiolytic actions of ethanol have been demonstrated experimentally employing anticonflict tests (Dalterio et al., 1988; Koob et al., 1984).",

      "title": "Reducing the nicotine content of combusted tobacco products sold in New Zealand",
      "abstract": "Large reductions in nicotine content could dramatically reduce reinforcement from and dependence on cigarettes. In this article, we summarise the potential benefits of reducing nicotine in combusted tobacco and address some of the common concerns. We focus specifically on New Zealand because it may be ideally situated to implement such a policy. The available data suggest that, in current smokers, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes decrease nicotine exposure, decrease cigarette dependence, reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day and increase the likelihood of contemplating, making and succeeding at a quit attempt. New smokers would almost certainly be exposed to far less nicotine as a result of smoking VLNC cigarettes and, consequently, would probably be less likely to become chronic, dependent, smokers. Many of the concerns about reducing nicotine including compensatory smoking, an exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, the perception that VLNC cigarettes are less harmful, and the potential for a black market are either not supported by the available data, likely mitigated by other factors including the availability of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, or unlikely to offset the potential benefit to public health. Although not all concerns have been addressed or can be a priori, the magnitude of the potential benefits and the growing evidence of relatively few potential harms should make nicotine reduction one of the centrepieces for discussion of how to rapidly advance tobacco control. Policies that aim to render the most toxic tobacco products less addictive could help New Zealand attain their goal of becoming smokefree by 2025.",

Such data as are available indicate that adults do a fair amount of it, while young people eat alone much less frequently. Commensal eating is deeply embedded in cultural consciousness and eating alone is an anomalous behavior. For most people a solitary meal is a highly undesirable situation and often is not considered to be a meal at all. Although individuals typically eat less when they eat alone than they do when they eat with others, for some people, eating alone provides an opportunity to escape public scrutiny and to eat as much as desired. Finally, eating alone is associated with negative nutritional outcomes in both the young and the old.",

      "title": "Health hazards related to energy drinks: Are we looking for them?",
      "abstract": "A 14-year-old Caucasian girl presented to the emergency department with a persistent headache lasting 6 h, which was not relieved by acetaminophen and ibuprofen, her fourth similar episode of the month. She worried about having already missed five days of school and wanted medication to prevent further episodes.\r\n\r\nShe denied any recent illness or drug ingestion. The patient had many friends, as well as a boyfriend, and could not think of any stress factors to explain her new condition. Approximately five weeks previously, a friend introduced her to energy drinks that she believed helped her become more focused on her school work. Additional inquiry revealed the presence of nervousness and insomnia; additionally, she mentioned that on two occasions her heart started to beat very quickly. She then asked, “Do you think that the three energy drinks I had yesterday could be related to my headache?”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEARNING POINTS\r\n\r\n‘Energy drinks’, as they have been called by the beverage industry, are commercially available nonalcoholic, carbonated and noncarbonated drinks that claim to boost energy level, alertness and performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main active ingredient in energy drinks is caffeine, present in varying amounts; however, guarana, sometimes called herbal caffeine, is considered to be a natural product and is not included in the amount of caffeine identified on the can or bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2006, more than 30% of adolescents reported using energy drinks. Caffeine metabolism slows down during puberty because of the natural surge of growth hormone, potentially increasing the risk of symptomatic effects and complications, especially in combination with other medications such as psychostimulants or amphetamines. \r\n\r\n○ Known adverse effects of caffeine are: headache, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, hallucinations, delirium and even death.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ Caffeine-associated withdrawal symptoms include: headache, tiredness, sleepiness, dysphoric mood, difficulty concentrating, decreased cognitive performance, depression, irritability, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches and stiffness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2011 CPSP survey on energy drinks revealed that: \r\n\r\n○ among 741 respondents, 9% (n=65) reported caffeine-related complications.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ according to the patients with complications, the three most frequent reasons for consuming these products were: to increase alertness (41%), peer pressure (39%) and sports performance (25%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn emerging trend in bars and dance clubs is to combine energy drinks with alcohol, which increases the risk of not realizing one’s degree of intoxication and the associated impairment of motor coordination and visual reaction time, as well as the risk of alcohol-related consequences, such as being physically hurt or injured, being taken advantage of sexually or taking advantage of another sexually, and riding with an intoxicated driver. \r\n\r\n○ In the CPSP survey, 28% of those who presented with complications associated with energy drinks had also consumed alcohol, and 26% had taken other drugs (psychostimulants 30%, cannabis 20% and amphetamines 10%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaediatricians and other health care providers: \r\n\r\n○ can play a very important role in educating children and adolescents about and in screening for energy drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ must inform the public on the potential health hazards related to excessive intake of caffeine-containing beverages by children and adolescents.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ should advocate for continued and better regulation of products containing a high concentration of caffeine.",

These symptoms were one of the most common Joseon kings’ diseases. However, why did some kings live longer or live shorter? This study starts from this question. The study found that the death causes of kings were lifestyle habits that harm their health such as geriatric diseases, complications and various illnesses to shorten longevity which result from oily foods, sensual pleasures and the reduction of the resistance by lack of exercise. Most of the Joseon kings suffered from both a lot of work and strengthening their governing power, and it brought them a plenty of mental stresses with lack of exercise. These mental fatigues increased appetite for greasy food to cause disease, and then too much sexual solicitation of concubines was followed with fullness. Thus all the stresses could end up with overeating and too much intercourse to death.",

Under this increased pressure athletes have turned to finding this \"magic ingredient\".

      "abstract": "Although smoking is seen as a major health problem by most clinicians, few are able to provide evidence based smoking cessation interventions to their patients. Most individuals who smoke actually want to quit. Unfortunately, smoking is still seen as a vice or lifestyle choice, when it is actually a chronic disease which often starts in adolescence. Nicotine dependence is complex and must be quantified and treated differently for each patient in order to achieve high quit rates. Smoking has a significant impact on the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. Smoking cessation is a cost effective and often overlooked prevention tool which improves both short- and long-term outcomes. There are both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for smoking cessation that can be applied in clinical practice. Brief advice, specialized counseling including therapeutic education and behavioral support, and first- and second-line pharmacological interventions have been proven to be effective to help smokers quit. Although classically tobacco dependence was seen in relation to smoking, since the early 2000s, new nicotine delivery systems have appeared on the market, which despite being marketed as “healthy” alternatives, can often complicate smoking cessation efforts and act as gateway devices for new generations of smokers. In this article we review the results of several large systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which have shown that many cessation strategies are effective. We also offer practical tips on providing brief cessation advice and how pharmacotherapy can be prescribed and incorporated into clinical practice in both primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention.",

      "title": "A Brief Analysis About the Drug Addiction by Youths in India",
      "abstract": "Abstract: People have been taking the drug in various forms for many years for enjoyment, relaxation, sleeping, stimulation, or another reason. In the starting, people takes the drug for taste and alter the consciousness, behavior, mood, and thoughts but he/she becomes habitual and dependent on any substance use disorder such as alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin, amphetamines, or illegal drugs. As per my thoughts and watching surroundings, if you ask a drug intake person “how do you become a drug addictive”? Most people will answer this “they started taking the drug in their friend circle, at relatives home or with relationship partner”. The first time they take it for taste or due to forcing by someone but after some time this becomes a habit. Peer pressure can fall you in this black world. Also, if someone has family history of addiction then he/she may chance to catch this addiction and make habitual others as well. So good friend circle really matters. Drugs such as heroin and marijuana are structured in the same way as chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are produced naturally by the human brain. As a result of this similarity, the drugs can fool the receptors of human brain and activate the nerve cells in such a way that they send some abnormal messages. In case of drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine, the nerve cells get activated and they release extraordinarily large volumes of neurotransmitters. They are also capable of preventing the brain from recycling these chemicals in a normal manner. A normal level of production is necessary in order to end the signal between neurons.

      "abstract": "For several years, smokeless tobacco has been promoted as a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. A massive ad campaign has resulted in an alarming increase in use in recent years. Recent evidence has related the use of smokeless tobacco to oral and pharyngeal cancers as well as other gum and tooth disorders. The habit-forming properties of smokeless tobacco are similar to those found with other tobacco products. A double standard is apparent when the use of smokeless tobacco is condoned. There is an implied acceptance of the use of this potentially dangerous, but legal, psychoactive substance. This article is a review and commentary about the status of this growing drug problem.",

      "abstract": "This paper uses data from the Health and Retirement Survey to measure the effects of alcohol on the incidence of morbidity and death. The study is able to reproduce the implied benefits of engaging in moderate levels of alcohol consumption, even after controlling for a large number of independent variables not usually available in health data sets. In fact, the controls work in the direction of supporting the benefits of engaging in even higher dose levels than conventionally recommended. It turns out, however, that smokers and quitters enjoy most of the benefits of unusually high alcohol consumption. Non-smokers evince modest benefits that are completely captured at very low dose levels. In general, the results suggest that studies of alcohol intake on health need to pay more attention to the characteristics of users. It may be that alcohol is especially beneficial for populations that are deficient in their health for other reasons like smoking or poor eating, whereas populations who follow good diets and do not smoke benefit very little from alcohol use.",

Community surveys suggest that alcohol consumption is lowest among elders compared to any other age group, and that patterns of drinking are relatively stable across mid-to-late life.

How difficult is it to spot potential alcohol misuse among the elderly?

This chapter indicates that young, low-income ecstasy users reported having more friends who used more licit and illicit drugs. It describes the characteristics of young, low-income female ecstasy users. These women perceived themselves using illicit drugs in the future, were at higher risk of continuing to use these drugs, and indicated higher levels of stress than respondents who used marijuana only or those who used other illicit drugs.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of avoidable premature mortality in the world, and quitting is known to reduce the risk of fatal diseases. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger adults; they may be effective aids to smoking cessation. Despite the increasing prevalence of e-cigarette use, little is known about their realworld use. The major concerns include the nicotine content and the potential harm due to the high concentrations of propylene glycol, chemicals, and other compounds found in the e-cigarette vapor. To our knowledge, there are no data on the health effects of acute use of nicotine-free e-cigarettes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the immediate effect of ecigarette vapors on airway mechanics. Forty apparently healthy neversmokers or light smokers were divided into two groups. The first group was instructed to 'vape' e-cigarettes with a 12-mg nicotine-filled cartridge, and the second group was asked to 'vape' e-cigarettes with an empty cartridge. Pulmonary function tests were assessed before and after 'vaping'. There was a significant increase in peripheral airway resistance of the first group, in which individuals vaped a nicotine-filled cartridge. There is potential for more permanent changes in lung function with long-term exposure to e-cigarettes, as with cigarette smoking.",

Smoking in pregnancy is now seen as one of those ‘facts of life’ that the medical and midwifery professions can do little to change. Intravenous drug users should always be tested, with their informed consent, for sexually transmitted infection, and for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infection, both to optimise the scope for treatment and to minimise the risk that the baby will also become infected. Most people who misuse drugs are not drug dependent. The problem only becomes an addiction if abrupt discontinuation causes serious physical and mental symptoms to appear. Breastfeeding can be generally encouraged in the period immediately after birth even if the mother has been taking several drugs, since these babies seem to show fewer features of withdrawal.",

      "title": "Effects of Nicotine on the Central Nervous System and Sleep Quality in Relation to Other Stimulants: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Nicotine is used extensively across the globe despite the common awareness of the fact that it might stimulate the neurological system in those who indulge in its consumption. Nicotine can be consumed in a wide number of various forms and can also be delivered in a wide variety of different ways. After it has been heated, it can be smoked, consumed sublingually, or brought into touch with mucosal surfaces, with the buccal mucosa being the most popular one. These three methods of consumption account for the vast majority of its use. It has been demonstrated without a reasonable doubt that people who partake in nicotine do, in fact, experience an increase in their levels of alertness, wakefulness, attention, and focus. The half-life of the substance, in addition to its effects, is highly variable depending on the forms in which it is consumed, viz. cigarettes, tobacco, gums, lozenges, and the manner in which it is administered. This is the case regardless of whether the chemical is administered orally or intravenously. It is common for a person to require multiple \"hits\" of the chemical throughout the course of the day, though the frequency of these needs and the intervals between them can vary greatly. The time interval between each of these \"hits\" can range anywhere from a few hours to a few minutes. The user has the potential to develop a tolerance to the neurostimulatory and systemic effects of nicotine, as well as a heightened sensitivity to those effects, and even hereditary predispositions to specific adverse consequences. There is also a possibility that the user will develop an addiction to nicotine. This literature review aims to explore the relationship between nicotine consumption and its effects on the central nervous system, especially on sleep.",

Prevention of drinking problems among youth is a major health policy goal; however, our efforts in this area have been less than satisfactory. This is especially true among college youth. College students use alcohol for recreation and a variety of social rituals. Although alternatives are encouraged and even mandated, problem drinking, especially binge drinking, among this population has not abated.",

Data from two separate studies of smokers were reanalyzed to examine associations between acute subjective and cardiovascular effects of nicotine vs. caffeine and between nicotine vs. alcohol. Typical intakes of cigarettes, alcohol, and caffeine were included as covariates when they were correlated with the responses of interest. Significant associations between nicotine and caffeine were seen for most of the subjective measures and for blood pressure responses. Fewer significant associations were observed between nicotine and alcohol. Responses associated between nicotine and both of the other drugs tended to reflect psychomotor stimulation. These results suggest that smokers who are more responsive to some of nicotine's subjective and blood pressure effects are also more sensitive to the same effects of caffeine and, to a lesser extent, of alcohol.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUÇÃO: O uso do tabaco está presente na história da sociedade desde o século XV, e se tornou muito utilizado e vicioso entre seus consumidores. Esse uso exagerado e precoce é um dos principais causadores de enfermidades, dentre elas, vários tipos de câncer (pulmão, pulmonar, bronquite crônica, asma e infecções respiratórias). OBJETIVO: Analisar a prática e o uso do tabaco na sociedade de modo geral. METODOLOGIA: Nesta análise foi aplicado uma busca bibliográfica utilizando como material de estudos, artigos científicos online listados como: Smoking Cessation Attempts and Common Strategies Employed (PubMed), Culture, acculturation and smoking use in Hmong, Khmer, Laotians, and Vietnamese communities in Minnesota (PubMed) e Reflections on passive smoking and COVID-19(PubMed). RESULTADOS: A partir dos dados analisados durante a pesquisa, foi possível observar que o uso do tabaco aumenta o risco e a chance de diversas condições sistêmicas negativas ao organismo, incluindo o câncer, doenças cardiovasculares e pulmonares, sendo também um grande danificador da saúde bucal aumentando a incidência e gravidade de câncer bucal e doenças periodontais no indivíduo tabagista, além de que o tabagismo é reconhecido globalmente como a principal causa mundial de morte evitável, sendo responsável por cerca de 100 milhões de pessoas. Mesmo havendo projetos para se combater e cessar o ato tabagista, como o MPOWER, a quantidade de pessoas que seguem esse protocolo ainda são poucas, não havendo grandes efeitos na redução do tabagista. CONCLUSÃO: Portanto, foi concluído que a prática do tabagismo na sociedade se deve de fatores sociais, culturais e neurofisiológicos decorrentes do uso frequentemente dessa substância que se torna viciosa para os consumidores e prejudicial à saúde.",

      "abstract": "The use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AS) to enhance appearance as well as physical/physiological capacities has increased dramatically over the past four decades in all age groups from early adolescence to adulthood. Although higher AS use rates are reported by elite and competitive athletes, a significant number of recreational athletes appear to be using AS. The scientific literature is inconsistent and at times at odds with the conventional wisdom and empirical experiences of the athletic community regarding the ergogenic effects of AS. However, individuals experienced in weight training, with an adequate diet, and who continue training during AS administration seem to consistently increase their strength and lean mass over what would have been expected from training alone. Previous research documenting deleterious but transient and mostly asymptomatic acute changes in physiology, risk factors and behavior has been inconclusive regarding the long term health impact. The abuse of AS constitutes a special challenge to society. AS are not euphorigenic or mood altering immediately following administration, as are other illicit drugs; the appetite for AS has been created predominantly by our societal fixations on winning and physical appearance. Consequently any successful intervention in this area must go beyond education, law enforcement and drug testing, and attempt to change a social environment which currently encourages the use of AS.",

      "abstract": "About 80% of smokers who stop smoking gain weight after they stop; on average 5 kg in the first year and about 6 to 7 kg overall. However, weight gain varies a lot between individuals, with some putting on 10 kg or more in a year. Although some factors predict who will gain excessive weight, they are not clinically useful for targeting individuals at high risk. Instead, it may be prudent to monitor weight gain after cessation and intervene with people gaining more than 1 kg/month. There is some evidence that weight gain after cessation can be prevented by dietary intervention that includes setting an energy intake goal and regular monitoring of weight and adjustment of energy intake. However, there are fears that such an approach may harm the success of a quit attempt because it may worsen craving for cigarettes. There is no evidence that this is the case, but the data are too imprecise to be completely reassuring. Exercise programs may reduce cravings for tobacco and increase the likelihood of achieving smoking abstinence, and there is some evidence that they reduce weight gain in the longer term. Consequently, they may be safely recommended but the effect on weight gain is modest. Long‑term nicotine replacement therapy prevents several kilograms of weight gain but it may produce harmful metabolic changes that increase cardiovascular risk. Randomized trials are needed to assess efficacy. Thus, weight gain after cessation remains problematic with few interventions to prevent it that have only modest effectiveness.",

From another point of view, it can be argued that a more useful model for understanding nicotine use is a functional model [2, 3]. A functional model argues that nicotine use is not an irrational behaviour but is adopted because it enables the user to control their bodily state, especially their psychological state. Nicotine use is maintained because it satisfies these needs and it can be seen as a resource that the person uses.",

      "title": "Nutrition and Eating Problems—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Children and teens with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have the same nutritional needs as all children and teens. Children with ASD may be picky eaters, so parents might worry they are not getting the nutrients they need. For example, if children do not get enough dairy (milk or cheese) because they do not want it or because of a special diet, they may not get enough calcium and vitamin D. If children do not eat enough foods made from grains, they may not get enough fiber and B vitamins. Some children with ASD are such picky eaters that they are at risk for nutritional disorders. They may also be at risk for low iron.Eating problems are common in children. In children with ASD, the problems may be more serious and last longer because of problems with taste, texture, or smell. They may be the result of learned behaviors. Up to 3 of 4 children with ASD may have problems with eating behaviors, food choice, and/or delayed feeding skills. These problems includeAcid reflux may lead to the child not wanting to eat. Distractions around a child may cause troubles with eating. For example, the school cafeteria is loud, bright, distracting, and disorganized, with multiple smells, which can be overwhelming to the child. Medication side effects, such as higher or reduced appetite, may also cause issues. Children with ASD may have a hard time knowing when they are full, when they are hungry, and how long they have been sitting at the table. The child might think he is “all done” after a bite or two of food or continue eating long after he is full. If your child has felt sick after eating a certain food, he may not want to eat that food again. This may happen even if the food was not what made your child sick. Your child might also eat only a few foods or not want to eat what has been a favorite food in the past. This may be related to anxiety, obsessions, not being flexible, or sensory problems.If your child has difficulties with eating, think about all medical, sensory, environmental, and other behavioral causes so you can work on these problems with your child’s pediatrician and therapists. Different members of the team may have creative solutions.A great way to work on eating and nutrition issues is to set up a regular structure for mealtimes. Offer your child meals and snacks at about the same times each day. Keep mealtime calm and remove distractions. Sit down with your child and eat the same foods. Your child should feed herself if she can. Do not ask your child to come to the dinner table until you are done preparing the food and are ready to sit down and eat.At each meal, be sure to serve at least one food that your child has eaten and liked in the past.Remember that a food often has to be offered multiple times before a child will eat it. Offer the new food on many days in a row with food your child likes to eat. This way, your child has something she is likely to eat. As much as you can, try to feed your children as many of the same foods as the rest of the family. Ask your child to eat, but do not beg or threaten. Once your child leaves the table, the meal is finished. To encourage eating at scheduled meals and snacks, do not give your child food or drink other than water until the next meal or snack. Use a visual schedule so that your child knows the time and place of each meal. She will learn to eat what the rest of the family eats and follow everyone else’s mealtime behaviors. So, the rest of the family will need to show good mealtime behaviors, eat fruits and vegetables, and avoid snacking. Your child will learn the eating habits of other family members.You can help your child learn about mealtime routines by telling and retelling a social story, which is a story in pictures or words about what you hope mealtimes will look like. Telling social stories about what should happen at mealtimes can help your child know what to expect at home, at school, and in the community. To deal with special feeding problems such as mouth packing, rechewing of food, and very limited diets, you will likely need help from experts. Talking with a registered dietitian may help too.Talk to your child’s therapists about how they can help him learn feeding skills and improve variety in his diet.Your child’s pediatrician will review your child’s diet at health checkups. Let her know if your child has a very limited diet or if you have placed your child on a special diet. The doctor will ask you some questions and do a physical examination to see if medical problems are causing eating problems. Tell your doctor if you notice burping, gagging, difficulty sleeping at night, or any other concerning symptoms. Also, tell your child’s doctor if you are giving any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications.Keep in mind that what you think children need to eat may actually be too much. Your child’s pediatrician will be able to tell you the portion sizes that are best for your child’s age and weight. Also, remember that a balanced diet takes into account what she eats over the whole week, not in one meal. Eating problems do not go away overnight. You will need to keep teaching your child the rules for eating.

      "abstract": "Currently, any activity the individual is not able to control, that lead him to compulsive behavior damaging his life quality is accepted as addiction. Drug-dependence, also called drug addiction of pharmacodependence, is a health problem caused by the frequent use of addictive substances called drugs. It is not a news that a big quantity of university students consume controlled drugs to supposedly potentiate their academic competence. Cuba is not free of this reality in spite of being a world bulwark in the antidrug fight.  This behavior imitation or learning is a key element among teenagers and university students, the difficulty rests in the drug access for the students of several specialties, what is not a trouble for the Medicine students.  We briefly expose several considerations on the theme",

Frecuentemente, se toman por automedicacion, son prescriptos por complacencia y aunque tengan una indicacion medica precisa, en ocasiones no se cumplen las normas establecidas para su uso correcto. Entre las variables epidemiologicas predominaron: las edades entre 50 y 64 anos y el sexo femenino. Las principales causas del consumo fueron: para disminuir la tension arterial y aliviar problemas familiares y laborales. Se concluyo que existio un alto indice de consumo de psicofarmacos de manera automedicada; los entrevistados accedieron a estos a traves de vias no convencionales, no relacionadas con el sistema de salud.",

The answer to this question is crucial to public health policy on control of drugs and alcohol, but it remains unanswered. Part of the difficulty lies in the different indicators of increasing use — per capita consumption versus incidence of new use — which measure separate aspects of growth of use. A second problem is related to the length of time between first use of a substance and the appearance of serious consequences. For those users who evolve to abusers, this interval is short for some drugs (like heroin) and long for others (like alcohol).",

Fortunately, human beings have, in principle, control over their conduct. Health-compromising behaviors can be eliminated by self-regulatory efforts, and health-enhancing behaviors. For instance, physical exercise, weight control, preventive nutrition, dental hygiene, or condom use, can be adopted. Perceiving a health threat seems to be the most obvious prerequisite for the motivation to end a risky behavior. In summary, changing health-related behaviors involves an initial motivation process that results in setting goals and a subsequent self-regulation processes that address the pursuit of these goals. Health psychologists are attempting to model these processes in order to understand how people become motivated to change their risky behaviors, and how they become encouraged to adopt and maintain healthy actions. In the initial motivation phase, a person develops an intention to act.",

      "title": "DESIGN FOR BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: A MODEL-DRIVEN APPROACH FOR TAILORING PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGIES",
      "abstract": "People generally want to engage in a healthy lifestyle, to live in harmony with the environment, to contribute to social causes, and to avoid behaviours that are harmful for themselves and others. However, people often find it difficult to motivate themselves to engage in these beneficial behaviours. Even adopting a healthy lifestyle, such as healthy eating, physical activity, or smoking cessation, is hard despite being aware of the benefits. The increasing adoption and integration of technologies into our daily lives present unique opportunities to assist individuals to adopt healthy behaviours using technology. As a result, research on how to use technology to motivate health behaviour change has attracted the attention of both researchers and health practitioners. Technology designed for the purpose of bringing about desirable behaviour and attitude changes is referred to as Persuasive Technology (PT). Over the past decade, several PTs have been developed to motivate healthy behaviour, including helping people with addictive behaviour such as substance abuse, assisting individuals to achieve personal wellness, helping people manage diseases, and engaging people in preventive behaviours. Most of these PTs take a one-size-fits-all design approach. However, people differ in their motivation and beliefs about health and what constitutes a healthy life. A technology that motivates one type of person to change her behaviour may actually deter behaviour change for another type of person. As a result, existing PTs that are based on the one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective for promoting healthy behaviour change for most people. \nBecause of the motivational pull that games offer, many PTs deliver their intervention in the form of games. This type of game-based PTs are referred to as persuasive games. Considering the increasing interest in delivering PT as a game, this dissertation uses persuasive games as a case study to illustrate the danger of applying the one-size-fits-all approach, the value and importance of tailoring PT, and to propose an approach for tailoring PTs to increase their efficacy. \nTo address the problem that most existing PTs employ the one-size-fits-all design approach, I developed the Model-driven Persuasive Technology (MPT) design approach for tailoring PTs to various user types. The MPT is based on studying and modelling user’s behaviour with respect to their motivations. I developed the MPT approach in two preliminary studies (N = 221, N = 554) that model the determinants of healthy eating for people from different cultures, of different ages, and of both genders. I then applied the MPT approach in two large-scale studies to develop models for tailoring persuasive games to various gamer types. In the first study (N = 642), I examine eating behaviours and associated determinants, using the Health Belief Model. Using data from the study, I modelled the determinants of healthy eating behaviour for various gamer types. In the second study (N = 1108), I examined the persuasiveness of PT design…",

      "title": "Hábitos masticatorios como factores de riesgo de la enfermedad periodontal en una población del Sur de la India",
      "abstract": "La enfermedad periodontal es de origen multifactorial. La infeccion siempre esta presente en la patologia, pero muchos factores pueden influir tanto en su inicio como en su progresion. Estos incluyen factores microbiologicos, geneticos, inmunologicos, ambientales y conductuales. Este ultimo representa un riesgo cuando las costumbres socioculturales incluyen eventos que pueden modificar la salud periodontal. La masticacion de betel y tabaco en la India son actividades culturales y populares importantes. Los productos de Betel son la cuarta sustancia psicoactiva mas comun en el mundo, despues de la cafeina, el alcohol y la nicotina. Este habito produce modificaciones significativas de la superficie dental, generando desgastes y manchas. Varios estudios han demostrado que los habitos socioculturales de masticar betel quid con o sin tabaco y tabaco en diferentes presentaciones tienen un efecto modificador en la enfermedad periodontal. Sin embargo, existe poca informacion disponible que compare el efecto del uso habitual de diferentes productos masticables sobre la salud periodontal en una poblacion caracterizada por estos habitos socioculturales. El objetivo de este estudio es evaluar comparativamente la salud periodontal en pacientes que habitualmente mastican diferentes productos y pacientes que no tienen estos habitos en la comunidad rural de Anantapur, en el estado de Andhra Pradesh, India. Objetivo: evaluar de forma comparada el estado periodontal en pacientes que mastican rutinariamente diferentes productos y pacientes que no tienen este habito. Metodos: se realizo un estudio transversal. Se consideraron los pacientes incluidos en las operaciones de atencion dental social promovidas y llevadas a cabo por la Fundacion Vicente Ferrer en la comunidad rural de Anantapur, estado de Andhra Pradesh, India. El examen oral registro los siguientes aspectos: Higiene oral por el Indice de Higiene Oral Simplificada (OHI-S) y el Indice Periodontal Comunitario (IPC) para el estado periodontal. Ademas, se aplico una encuesta validada que incluia aspectos relacionados con el habito de masticacion. Resultados: Un total de 1023 pacientes cumplieron con todos los criterios de inclusion / exclusion. Los pacientes fueron divididos en 3 grupos etarios de 20-34 , 35-44 y de 45-65 anos. El 57.9% (n = 593) de los pacientes indicaron que no tenian el habito de masticar sustancias. De los pacientes masticadores habituales (n = 430), el 17,2% masticaron productos de betel quid (BQ), 16% de betel quid mas tabaco (BQ + Tb) y 8,9% de preparaciones de tabaco (Tb). Los pacientes con habito de masticacion se asociaron significativamente con valores de IPC peores. El IPC entre los masticadores BQ, BQ + Tb y Tb no mostro diferencias significativas. El 91.3% (n = 934) de los pacientes que presentaron un OHI-S considerado deficiente-malo, y un 84.85% (n = 868) indicaron higiene bucal una vez al dia. Estos grupos se relacionaron significativamente con peores valores de IPC. Los sextantes 1, 3, 4 y 6 de los pacientes masticadores mostraron un predominio de valores de IPC peores. El odds ratio mostro un mayor efecto de habito de masticacion en el sextante cuatro y seis. El analisis del efecto de los productos de masticacion mostro una asociacion de valores de IPC peores en el segundo y quinto sexto con los productos BQ + Tb. Conclusiones: en la poblacion estudiada, el habito de masticacion se asocio con una mayor prevalencia de valores de IPC peores. Esta asociacion no se modifico por genero, rango de edad o el estado de higiene y fue independiente de los productos de masticacion identificados en este estudio. Si bien las diferencias en los valores de IPC se encontraron entre los sextantes, tanto para los masticadores como para los no masticadores, el habito de masticacion parecio tener un mayor efecto local en los sextantes cuatro y seis.",

      "title": "Quit or Die: Nothing in between?",
      "abstract": "Accessible online at: www.karger.com/journals/res When asked about their interest in stopping smoking sometime in the future, 54% of smokers in the European Union state such an interest [1]. However, not all of these smokers actually make a serious attempt to give up and only a few percent succeed at each attempt [2]. Despite all kinds of approaches to control smoking, little is being done to decrease the prevalence of smoking in Europe. Smoking shortens the life of 50% of long-term smokers. Given this scenario, new ways to address this health problem need to be developed [3]. The need to find new approaches is even more compelling in the case where patients with severe COPD are either unable or unwilling to give up smoking with the traditional ‘abrupt-quitting’ method. For many physicians it is common to ask the patients to smoke less rather than give up smoking. This advice may be a way not to be too harsh with the patient, or even a solution for those who have failed to quit during many earlier attempts. The soft advice to smoke less almost always fails, mostly because the smoker is dependent on nicotine and therefore usually rapidly returns to the normal smoking rate. Most researchers and clinicians interested in the treatment of tobacco dependence know this. Therefore the prevailing attitude is not to give advice to smoke less or reduce smoking. The new approach suggested by Jimenez et al. [4] in this issue of Respiration is to substitute the ‘lost’ nicotine from an alternative source, e.g. from a nicotine chewing gum. Earlier studies [5, 6] have shown that nicotine replacement (NR) can aid smoking reduction in healthy subjects and also improve risk factors, e.g., cardiovascular disease [7, 8]. In the study of Jimenez et al. [4], 17 smokers with severe COPD who were unable or unwilling to stop smoking were offered to reduce their smoking with the aid of NR. Their tobacco dependence was severe, on average 9 points on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), which ranges from 0 to 10. In a representative sample of smokers, only about 2% can be expected to have a dependence 18 points on the FTND [9]. Success in giving up smoking is related to the degree of dependence. Usually no more than 5–10% of smokers so heavily dependent can be expected to give up long term. Having moderate to severe COPD is a negative prognostic factor for giving up smoking, so if anything, a lower percentage could be expected. This means that if Jimenez et al. [4] had insisted on the 17 smokers to give up completely and abruptly, 1, or 2 at most, might have been able to give up long term. This would mean a reduction of 39–78 cigarettes per day (CPD); the mean baseline smoking was 39 CPD. That outcome should be compared to the 5 patients who reduced cigarette consumption by 85%, i.e. 165 CPD in total. Such a comparison has its weaknesses, since 1 or 2 patients would not have smoked at all, and it is possible that harm reduction is not linearly related to the reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked. What is particularly intriguing with this study is that we do not just observe a reduction in cigarettes smoked, but a consistent improvement in lung function, i.e. harm reduction. Reduced smoking can result in harm reduc-",

Deshalb kann davon ausgegangen werden, dass das Inhalieren von E-Zigaretten-Dampf für Erwachsene weitgehend unschädlich oder mit Sicherheit weniger schädlich als das Zigarettenrauchen ist. Zudem gibt es keine Daten, die belegen, dass E-Zigaretten bei Jugendlichen den Einstieg zum Rauchen von Zigaretten fördern. Der Konsum von E-Zigaretten mit nikotinhaltigen Liquids ist für stark nikotinabhängige Raucher, nach Scheitern einer strukturierten Raucher-entwöhnung eine Möglichkeit, um die Anzahl gerauchter Zigaretten zu reduzieren oder mit dem Rauchen aufzuhören.

These are critical periods in time in human development, because a lot of the patterns of these harmful behaviours appear in a lifetime during these periods of time. Research has constantly shown that adolescents and emergent adults emerge themselves in harmful behaviours that endanger their health, which inevitably influence their psychological wellbeing. These behaviours include alcohol and drugsconsumption, unprotected sex, poor diet choices and even delinquent acts characterized by a negative influence upon colleagues and growth in risks.",

      "abstract": "The term \"Spice\" is used to refer to a diverse group of herbal products that are marketed under a variety of names (e.g., K2, fake marijuana, Skunk, Black Mamba, etc), herbal combinations, and added ingredients that are pharmacologically active[1]. These products include dried shredded plant material and chemical additives, most of which have some cannabinoid activity. Despite the fact that the Spice products typically are labeled as incense and \"not for human consumption\", the reality is they are marketed to persons who intend to consume (usually smoke) the Spice for its psychoactive (principally marijuana-like) effects. Reports by consumers are highly variable with most claiming experiences resembling those caused by marijuana use; however, because many of the added drugs are unknown, they are not detected by standard drug screens. Around the world, as many as 15 or more different active cannabinoid ingredients have been identified in Spice in various combinations: this number is increasing as manufacturers try to counter governments attempt to regulate or eliminate public access to these products.",

      "abstract": "L‘alcoolisation chronique et surtout l‘alcoolodependance restent un probleme majeur de sante publique. Pendant longtemps, il etait admis que les dimensions culturelles et familiales influencaient le mode de consommation et le type de dependance. Si la transmission genetique de l‘alcoolisme n‘existe pas, la predisposition a devenir alcoolique se transmet. Ce n‘est ni une transmission mendelienne, ni une transmission liee au sexe, mais une transmission polygenique, ce qui explique la complexite des travaux. Le risque de developper une dependance est cinq fois plus eleve en cas d‘antecedent d‘alcoolisme chez l‘un des parents. En ce qui concerne les marqueurs genetiques predisposant a l‘alcoolisme, il a ete montre que, dans les populations deficientes en alcool deshydrogenase, il existait des reactions de flushing lors de la prise d‘alcool et moins d‘alcoolodependance. Il existe aussi un lien entre l‘allele A1 du recepteur D2 a la dopamine et les formes severes de dependance alcoolique, peut‐etre du au fait que l‘alcool, en stimulant la production de dopamine, comble le manque de sensibilite a cette molecule du recepteur D2. Il existe actuellement une relative imprecision des marqueurs suspectes dans la transmission genetique de l‘alcoolisme. L‘environnement et l‘education jouent un role important dans le type de consommation (âge de debut, frequence). L‘identification genetique des personnes a risque de devenir dependantes pourra permettre de reperer les facteurs psychologiques et environnementaux utiles a la prevention de l‘alcoolisme. Une meilleure connaissance des mecanismes neurochimiques des effets de l‘alcool sur l‘organisme devrait faire apparaitre des molecules selectives dans le traitement de la dependance.",

      "abstract": "Opium smoking began spreading slowly but steadily in China from early in the 18th Century. It grew through the 19th Century to the point that by the end of the century it became a nearly universal practice among males in some regions. While estimates vary, it appears that most smokers consumed six grams or less daily. Addicted smokers were occasionally found among those smoking as little as three grams daily, but more often addicted smokers reported use of about 12 grams a day or more. An individual smoking twelve grams of opium probably ingests about 80 mg. of morphine. Thirty mg. of morphine daily may induce some withdrawal signs, while 60 mg. daily are clearly addicting. While testimony varied widely, it appears likely that most opium smokers were not disabled by their practice. This appears to be the case today, too, among those peoples in southeast Asia who have continued to smoke opium. There appear to be social and perhaps psychophysiological forces which work toward limiting the liabilities of drug use.",

Designed to enhance physical performance, they promise a quick energy boost, improved mood, and increased focus. However, excessive consumption is linked to serious health risks. Overconsumption of energy drinks can lead to arrhythmia, seizures, tachycardia, and even death. Chronic consumption can result in elevated blood pressure, psycho-physical disorders, and addiction. Children, adolescents, and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable. A worrying trend is the mixing of energy drinks with alcohol, which amplifies the risk of adverse health effects. Marketing tactics promoting energy drinks at major events and featuring athletes and musicians have increased their appeal, especially among teenagers. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend, with younger individuals turning to these drinks to cope with stress and isolation. Addressing this issue requires educating adolescents and raising awareness about the consequences of excessive consumption. Establishing safe doses of energy drink ingredients and thoroughly documenting their side effects is crucial.",

The adolescent brain is especially very sensitive to products such as e-cigarettes, nicotine, and tobacco. Chronic nicotine exposure causes permanent brain damage and cognitive decline. Interestingly there are reports on the use of nicotine and its effects on the epigenetic changes in the brain. These kinds of changes may prepare the brain for further abuse of various illegal drugs. As a result of chronic nicotine exposure brain infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, brain atrophy, and dementia are also known to occur. Neurodevelopment in children is potentially harmed due to exposure to nicotine and nicotinic products. This is due to the inflammation, atherosclerosis, and oxidative stress to the neuronal cells. Pregnant mothers and people who are at risk of developing neurodegenerative disease need to be forbidden from using nicotine. Nicotine can be dangerous when taken with alcohol as it can lead to depression and neurocognitive decline. This chapter addresses the effects of nicotine on the adolescent and adult brain.",

Pocos campos del conocimiento han sido objeto de tantos procesos de reduccionismo que se repercuten los unos sobre los otros: por ejemplo, el alcoholismo seria una adiccion asociada a ciertas regiones del Nucleus accumbens, que a su vez habrian sido condicionadas, programadas, predeterminadas, por ciertos genes. Todas estas especulaciones facilistas parecen corresponder mucho mas a la necesidad de ofrecer respuestas a una comunidad avida de entender que es lo que ocurre, que a una prolongada, paciente, dificil y a veces esteril, serie de investigaciones.",

Cannabis is commonly used among people who drink alcohol, and using alcohol and cannabis simultaneously is associated with a greater frequency of alcohol-impaired driving. Laboratory studies demonstrate the harmful effects of simultaneous use on driving ability compared to alcohol use alone, yet driving under the influence of cannabis is perceived as a low risk. We tested the influences of alcohol, cannabis, and their simultaneous use on perceived driving impairment and willingness to drive in daily life. Participants were 88 adults aged 18-44 (",

      "title": "EVALI: consequências do cigarro eletrônico",
      "abstract": "A ascensão dos cigarros eletrônicos, também conhecidos como vaporizadores ou vapes, tem sido notável nas últimas décadas. Esses dispositivos foram inicialmente introduzidos como alternativas aparentemente mais seguras ao tabagismo tradicional, oferecendo uma maneira de satisfazer a nicotina sem os efeitos prejudiciais associados à queima de tabaco. Vários fatores contribuíram para a crescente popularidade dos cigarros eletrônicos, variando desde a percepção de menor risco até mesmo o aspecto social e cultural. Porém muitos se esqueceram que o fator risco conhecido como tabagismo é uma das causas para doenças cardiovasculares e pulmonares. Os cigarros eletrónicos são utilizados por milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo, especialmente pelos mais jovens. Em 2021, 48% dos canadenses com idade entre 20 e 24 anos e 29% daqueles com idade entre 15 e 19 anos relataram já ter usado cigarros eletrônicos, enquanto apenas 13% dos adultos com 25 anos ou mais relataram ter feito isso. Nos Estados Unidos em 2019 o surto de lesões pulmonares associadas ao uso de cigarros eletrônicos ou produtos de vaporização levou a mais de 2.800 hospitalizações, onde destacou os riscos dos cigarros eletrônicos e dos produtos de vaporização. No momento, todos os cigarros eletrônicos são regulamentados como produtos de tabaco, o que significa que não estão sujeitos a estudos de segurança pré-comercialização em animais e humanos, como exigido para medicamentos ou dispositivos médicos. Essa classificação implica que os cigarros eletrônicos estão sujeitos a regulamentações específicas relacionadas ao tabaco, e não necessariamente aos rigorosos processos de aprovação de outros produtos destinados à saúde. A lesão pulmonar aguda relacionada ao uso de cigarro eletrônico ou vaping (EVALI) descrita pela primeira vez em 2019, é um espectro de padrões radiográficos e histológicos consistentes com lesão pulmonar aguda a subaguda, sendo uma consequência grave da vaporização. É oportuno, portanto, rever as implicações a curto prazo e especialmente a longo prazo dos cigarros eletrónicos e dos produtos de vaporização na saúde cardiopulmonar. Realizou-se uma revisão sistemática de literatura por meio da plataforma pubmed, com seleção e análise criteriosa dos artigos, a fim de elucidar o EVALI e as consequências mediantes o uso do E-cigarro. Nesta revisão foi identificado que existem limitações na literatura mundial sobre o devido tema, por poucas evidências que apoiem intervenções eficazes para a cessação do vaping e por estar afetando globalmente os adultos jovens e jovens. Notou-se que o EVALI é um diagnóstico de exclusão e, por isso, leva vários dias para que outras etiologias sejam descartadas. Foi observado na análise da literatura que as evidências moleculares e clínicas iniciais sugerem vários efeitos fisiológicos agudos dos sistemas eletrônicos de distribuição de nicotina, particularmente aqueles que contêm nicotina. Os recentes estudos demonstram que além de causarem o EVALI, o sistema eletrônico de entrega de nicotina (ENDS) prejudica a dilatação mediada pelo endotélio na periferia, sugerindo uma biodisponibilidade reduzida de óxido nítrico. Evidências emergentes sugerem que os solventes de nicotina propilenoglicol e glicerol têm efeitos cardiopulmonares, onde sistemicamente podem levar à acidose metabólica, lesão renal aguda e síndrome semelhante à sepse. E pra soma com a grande mistura de componentes, os aditivos aromatizantes possuem toxicidades diferentes, mas são provavelmente uma fonte importante de toxicidade cardiopulmonar induzida por ENDS. Adoçantes como glicose e sacarose são comumente usados em e-líquidos e contribuem para a formação de aldeídos reativos. Dessa forma, a análise busca contribuir para um entendimento mais aprofundado das complicações no contexto global dos cigarros eletrônicos.",

Health risks related to ST have received comparatively little attention, in spite of widespread use in many parts of the world. With the current emphasis on adverse health consequences of tobacco smoking, including exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, there may be a shift to increased use of ST. Habitual use of oral tobacco can increase the risk of oral cancer. Increasing use has been reported not only among men, but also among such vulnerable groups as children, teenagers, women of reproductive age, and by immigrants of the South Asian origin wherever they have settled. However, the known and suspected health risks associated with ST indicate that it should not be viewed as an alternative to smoking. The present review portrays a vivid description of the various ill effects of ST usage.",

The use of low-tar and low-nicotine yield cigarettes has been paradoxically accompanied by an increased risk of lung cancer due to increased tobacco use and exposure to cigarette yields with higher mutagen and carcinogen content. Alcoholic beverages clearly increase the risk of oral cavity, liver, eso-phageal, breast, and other cancers. However, the actual mechanisms that alcohol drinking contributes to carcinogenesis have not been well defined. The use of tobacco products, as they are intended to be used, results in the exposure to more than 100 mutagens and carcinogens. Different types of methods for assessing tobacco-related cancer risk in humans are available. External exposure markers attempt to predict exposure without regard to interindividual differences in smoking behavior and cellular processes.",

      "abstract": "A survey of 364 college freshman women was conducted to examine weight loss practices. Nearly 60% of women were currently on a diet to lose or to maintain weight. Since entering college 7 months earlier, 29% had used crash dieting or fasting as a means of weight control. Even though most had experimented with purging and diet pills in high school, most of these had discontinued these practices. Twenty percent had at some time used diet pills, but only 4% were currently users; 13% had at some time used purgatives (vomiting, laxatives, or diuretics), but only 5% were current users. Use of purgatives may indicate a more general pattern of addictive health behavior. Compared to women who had never used purgatives, current purgative users were 4.1 times more likely to smoke (44% vs 11%) and 2.7 times as likely to use drugs (33% vs 12%). Of the 51 women who had ever smoked, 37% listed weight control as a reason for it. Longitudinal investigations are needed to determine how weight loss practices track from adolescence into adulthood and to determine factors predisposing to the establishment of unhealthy weight loss practices, such as severely restrictive dieting, \"yo-yo dieting\" (weight cycling), and use of diet pills, purgatives, or tobacco.",

Despite knowing that smoking is dangerous and how it puts one's life at stake, many people ignore the risks and continue to smoke. A cigarette smoke contains more than 5000 chemicals, the main ingredients being tobacco and nicotine. At least 100 of these chemicals are carcinogenic, known to causecancers and other illnesses. Quitting cigarettes is not as hard as people think it is. It requires strong will power and motivation to quit smoking. Once a person becomes smoke free, the process of repair is initiated immediately. Within one week the person feels more energetic and healthy. Withinfew years the lungs become normal and return to their original state. Fortunately it's never too late to take a leap of faith and quit this bad habit for once and all.",

      "abstract": "The number one cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States is tobacco use. According to data from the National Health Interview Survey, 18.7% of US adults (46 million people) currently use a tobacco product. Smoking causes lung, laryngeal, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancers and possibly breast cancer. Nicotine is the highly addictive component of tobacco that releases dopamine when it binds to alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. This produces reward sensations that become associated with specific behaviors and relieves stress and negative emotions. Public policy changes, behavioral interventions, and pharmacologic approaches have been shown to reduce tobacco use. Combining behavior therapy with pharmacotherapy increases cessation rates. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved five nicotine replacement therapies and two no-nicotine oral medications to assist with smoking cessation. Medications are categorized as controllers or relievers based on their pharmacokinetics. Nicotine replacement therapy delivers lower amounts of nicotine and needs to be titrated to alleviate patient cravings. Varenicline is a selective partial agonist at the alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and is recommended over bupropion for smoking cessation.",

      "abstract": "O presente artigo versa sobre o alcoolismo e as consequencias sociais, familiares, fisicas e psiquicas do dependente. O alcool e uma substância que acompanha o ser humano desde os tempos mais remotos. Sempre associado a bons momentos e consumido livremente dentro dos lares, em festas e comemoracoes. Por ser uma droga licita, o alcool comeca a ser utilizado muito antes do que o indicado por orgaos de saude. Os incentivos para que ele seja consumido sao bastante atraentes para os jovens. Os resultados derivados desse uso abusivo poderao persistir durante toda a vida adulta, causando problemas fisiologicos e psicologicos. A familia de um dependente sofre as consequencias desse vicio juntamente com o alcoolatra. A degradacao familiar, a perda do emprego e as sequelas causadas nos filhos sao algumas das consequencias do uso abusivo do alcool. Dependentes se veem excluidos da sociedade e vao para as ruas, onde a alternativa de sustento se apresenta de varias maneiras. Politicas publicas aparecem como tentativas de repressao ao consumo indevido de bebidas alcoolicas. O objetivo geral da pesquisa foi mostrar as consequencias que o alcoolismo gera em todas as areas da vida do dependente. A metodologia utilizada foi a de abordagem bibliografica qualitativa-descritiva extraida de livros, artigos e revistas impressas e eletronicas voltadas para o tema em questao. Conclui-se que sao muitas as consequencias negativas do uso indevido e abusivo do alcool e que a exclusao social dos alcoolicos, causa implicacoes a comunidade como um todo.\r\nPalavras-Chave: alcool, dependencia, exclusao social, droga.",

      "abstract": "The use of mind-altering drugs other than alcohol presents a serious contemporary problem. Some people are concerned about the real effects of drugs on users, others about perceived effects which at times seem to bear little relationship to pharmacologic reality. Many are aroused primarily because they see in drug use a symptom of widespread moral and religious decay. A few are worried largely because they fear that drug users may commit acts which harm innocent nonusers. All of these concerns are important in considering the role of mindaltering drugs in the occurrence of highway crashes, because these concerns have largely determined our perception of the problem of drugs and highway crashes. At times, they have led to preventive and corrective actions that not only are inappropriate but often sap away scarce funds and effort that should be devoted to more effective solutions. In this communication the following questions are explored:",

      "abstract": "De flesta ungdomar, både flickor och pojkar, börjar dricka alkohol någon gång i mellersta ton­åren och berusningsdrickande är inte ovanligt. Att avvika från detta mönster och ha en ovanligt tidig eller en ovanligt sen alkoholdebut har visat sig vara riskfaktorer för senare alkoholproblem. Vid vilken ålder man först prövar alkohol, och hur ofta och hur mycket alkohol ungdomarna dricker påverkas av många faktorer. Tonåringens egen personlighet och anpassningsförmåga spelar in, och dessa faktorer förändras ofta då man mognar in i vuxenrollen, då också alko­holkonsumtionen brukar stabiliseras. Samhällets normer och tillgången på alkohol har också effekt på alkoholkonsumtionen. En annan viktig faktor är kamratkretsens alkoholbruk. Om kamratkretsen som tonåringen umgås i har hög eller låg alkoholkonsumtion beror ofta på hennes eget val av likasinnade vänner, men föräldrarnas attityd till alkohol och deras grad av övervakning har också effekt. Föräldrarnas egen alkoholkonsumtion påverkar tonåringens kon­sumtion, och även framtida alkoholproblem. Sannolikt är detta en kombination av arv och miljö. Få forskningsstudier har ännu rapporterat skillnader mellan pojkar och flickor i riskfaktorer för högkonsumtion under tonåren.",

      "title": "Could Vaping be a New Weapon in the Battle of the Bulge?",
      "abstract": "As the prevalence of tobacco smoking has been decreasing, obesity has increased. Obesity is set to overtake tobacco smoking in many developed countries as the primary preventable cause of conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Obesity is a complex condition that is challenging public health prevention efforts. Tobacco smoking mitigates weight gain through nicotine's effect on the brain and metabolism. The prospect of gaining weight upon stopping smoking acts as an inhibitor to quitting and weight gain post-cessation is a common cause of relapse. Vaping nicotine is a new and controversial phenomenon that is highly attractive to smokers, but raises fears for health among public health and tobacco control advocates. There have been some reports among vapers that vaping is helping to mitigate weight gain after stopping smoking and or vaping is helping them to control their weight. There are several potential mechanisms by which vaping, in addition to the direct effects of nicotine, could facilitate weight control, these include taste perception, physical mouthfeel, and sensation and behavioral replacement. Research on the potential for vaping to support weight control may be worth pursuing given the human and economic costs of the global obesity epidemic and the failure of current obesity prevention strategies. Obesity is set to overtake tobacco smoking in many countries as the primary cause of several high-cost diseases. Tobacco smoking mitigates weight gain through nicotine's effect on the brain and metabolism. Smoking, however, is associated with many illnesses and premature death and appropriately has been discouraged leading to declining prevalence rates. This article explores the emerging perception that vaping electronic cigarettes with nicotine and flavors could deliver similar appetite and weight control effects as smoking. The potential to reduce risks associated with excess weight deserves exploration. An initial research agenda is suggested.",

When thinking about what we know and what we have accomplished in the realm of smoking and health, we perceive a paradox. Decades of careful medical research have documented the hazards of smoking. Social scientists continue to investigate and define the factors that impede efforts to prevent the use of tobacco. We know that nicotine is an addictive substance and that our children are very vulnerable to this addiction. We know that smoking is the single greatest cause of death in the United States.<sup>1</sup>Yet, we are still plagued by an entirely preventable problem, and this is the paradox of tobacco control. To better understand this paradox and perhaps be better able to reconcile what we know and what we do, we have developed a framework that provides an organized approach to categorizing tobacco control",

Se realizo un analisis de contenido cualitativo. Nuestros resultados muestran que los jovenes atendidos suelen considerar su experiencia con una intoxicacion etilica como un «mal trago» que hay que pasar y olvidar. Justifican dicha intoxicacion con razones no relacionadas con el consumo abusivo de alcohol (no habian comido, mala suerte, padecer diabetes, etc.). El servicio de urgencias es la ultima medida terapeutica para revertir los efectos adversos de una intoxicacion etilica aguda y no consideran, tras su experiencia, dejar de beber, aunque la mayoria de la muestra consultada puso de manifiesto la necesidad de moderar el consumo de alcohol. Los resultados se discuten proporcionando ideas para poder realizar intervenciones en los servicios de urgencias que sean adecuadas a las necesidades de las personas jovenes y la organizacion de los servicios sanitarios.

We develop a qualitative content analysis. Our results show that youth served often consider their experience with AAI as a “bad shot” that is necessary to go and forget. They justified this AAI with causes unrelated to alcohol abuse (have not eaten, bad luck, diabetes, etc.). The urgency department is the last therapeutic measure to reverse the adverse effects of AAI and do not consider stop drinking, although most of the consulted youth recognized that they need to moderate the alcohol consumption.

      "abstract": "For a detective, the easiest crimes to solve are those with an apparent motive: He wanted her money, and so he killed her for it. The crime makes sense. Crimes with no apparent motive are more difficult, such as when a person is attacked by someone unknown to him or her. But perhaps there are clues—a hair follicle, a scrap of clothing, or an eyewit­ ness. The most difficult crimes of all are those that occur despite apparent countermotives: He had spent his life savings to protect her, so why would he have killed her? In this case, even the best detective is at a loss to explain why it happened. Treatment providers can encounter similar puzzles when trying to explain the motivation behind substance abuse. Some people, particu­ larly those in the early stages of addiction, seem to have clear motives for use. Perhaps they enjoy the pleasurable effects or use to minimize negative effects. However, people in later stages of addiction are more puzzling since they seem to use despite the effects. In fact, it’s not uncommon for persons in later-stage addiction to say that they use drugs despite the effects rather than because of them. At the same time, people may feel that they like the drug less but need it more.",

      "abstract": "Le tabagisme est la cause de longues maladies, responsables chaque annee de 6 millions de deces. Le principal composant du tabac, la nicotine, est l'un des psychotropes les plus addictifs. L’abandon du tabac est difficile et les pharmacotherapies les plus efficaces, telles que la varenicline, ne viennent en aide qu’a une proportion limitee des 70% de fumeurs qui souhaitent stopper. Des etudes cliniques et precliniques ont demontre que plusieurs mecanismes psychopharmacologiques differents contribuent au maintien de la prise de nicotine. Des donnees psychologiques, genetiques et neurobiologiques, issues d’etudes cliniques, indiquent desormais que le poids respectif de ces mecanismes psychopharmacologiques pourrait varier d’un fumeur a l’autre. Cette heterogeneite pourrait contribuer a l’inegale efficacite de la varenicline, dont les cibles psychopharmacologiques sont encore mal connues, ainsi qu’a la faible validite predictive des modeles precliniques, qui ne tiennent pas compte de cette possible heterogeneite individuelle. Dans ce travail de these, au moyen de l’auto-administration intraveineuse de nicotine chez le rat, nous avons explore les variations individuelles dans la sensibilite aux effets renforcants primaires de la nicotine et aux effets de la nicotine sur la sensibilite aux effets renforcants de stimuli environnementaux associes. Nous avons mis en evidence trois sous-populations d'individus dont la recherche de nicotine est controlee par une contribution differente de ces deux types d’effets de la nicotine. Les phenotypes de ces sous-populations ont ete valides par des marqueurs comportementaux preexistants a la consommation de nicotine (l’approche conditionnee pavlovienne), par des marqueurs du metabolisme de la nicotine et des marqueurs neurobiologiques des neurotransmissions cholinergique et dopaminergique dans des structures cerebrales cles. En parallele, nous avons explore les cibles psychopharmacologiques de la varenicline. En utilisant une nouvelle approche qui permet de manipuler, pendant l’autoadministration, les effets de la nicotine sur les effets renforcants d’un stimulus environnemental associe, nous avons montre que la varenicline antagonise a la fois ces effets de la nicotine et ses effets renforcants primaires. Neanmoins, dans le premier cas, la varenicline agit d’autant plus que la sensibilite individuelle aux effets de la nicotine est elevee, alors que l’intensite de son effet ne depend pas de l’amplitude des effets renforcants primaires de la nicotine. Ce travail de these met en evidence et valide des variations individuelles dans les mecanismes qui regissent le comportement de recherche de nicotine dans un modele preclinique. Il offre pour perspective d'explorer les mecanismes neurobiologiques responsables de ces variations individuelles et l’impact a long terme de ces variations sur le developpement de la dependance a la nicotine, ainsi que de tester si la varenicline est plus efficace chez l’une des sous-populations identifiees.",

E-cigarettes are devices that aerosolize nicotine- or cannabis-based concentrates mixed with other solvents and have been marketed as an alternative to cigarettes. E-cigarette use, or vaping, is increasingly popular but has not been proven to be an innocuous substitute for traditional smoking. Several patterns of vaping-associated inhalational lung injuries have been reported in the past few years. This article reviews many of the imaging patterns that have been encountered in association with e-cigarette use. CONCLUSION. E-cigarette use is associated with a range of lung injury patterns that have only recently been recognized as use of these products continues to rise. When the radiologist sees one of these patterns of lung injury, it is important to raise the possibility of vaping-induced lung injury because cessation of vaping is an important step in treatment.",

Wesleyan students were more likely to have used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at some point and showed some tendency to have used it more recently, but did not differ significantly as to total cumulative use or the time they first tried it. For all hallucinogens, all users reported experiencing pleasant effects much more frequently than unpleasant effects. A majority of all nonusers reported knowing someone who had used hallucinogens, and a sizeable minority reported having seriously considered trying it.",

Orang yang mengalami kecanduan narkoba, bukan saja membahayakan kesehatan jasmaninya tetapi juga kesehatan rohaninya bahkan akan dapat meng-hancurkan kesehatan sosial. Oleh karena itu, dengan begitu besarnya dampak negatif dari kecanduan narkoba ini, maka tentunya harus senantiasa diupayakan solusi untuk mengatasinya agar bagi para pecandu narkoba dapat menghentikan perbuatannya dan bagi mereka yang belum terkena dapat terhindar dari dampak negatif narkoba tersebut, dan salah satu solusi untuk mengatasi pencandu narkoba tersebut yaitu melalui pendekatan Psikologi Dakwah.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Weight-Loss Diets",
      "abstract": "Weight-loss dieting refers to purposefully regulating, usually limiting, food intake in order to achieve a specific goal, typically focused on weight management. Weight-loss dieting practices can involve reducing calorie intake, limiting portions, or following a particular eating pattern or regimen—for example, cutting carbohydrates and fats while preferring proteins. Yet dieting is much more than an individual activity. It is influenced by and mirrors a society’s power dynamics and social hierarchies that are also determined by weight and body shape. Looking particularly at the history of this phenomenon in modern industrialized societies like the United States, developments in weight-loss dieting are closely intertwined with gender and citizenship. Weight-loss dieting was a male practice in the 19th century and became a decidedly feminized practice in the 20th century. Furthermore, there have been concerns about the negative effects of weight-loss dieting as voiced by anti-diet nutritionists and the academic field of fat studies. Weight management is expressive of public discourses around health, capitalism, and body politics.",

      "title": "Will chronic e-cigarette use cause lung disease?",
      "abstract": "Chronic tobacco smoking is a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the lung, tobacco smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, and also causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which encompasses both emphysema and chronic bronchitis. E-cigarettes (E-Cigs), or electronic nicotine delivery systems, were developed over a decade ago and are designed to deliver nicotine without combusting tobacco. Although tobacco smoking has declined since the 1950s, E-Cig usage has increased, attracting both former tobacco smokers and never smokers. E-Cig liquids (e-liquids) contain nicotine in a glycerol/propylene glycol vehicle with flavorings, which are vaporized and inhaled. To date, neither E-Cig devices, nor e-liquids, are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has proposed a deeming rule, which aims to initiate legislation to regulate E-Cigs, but the timeline to take effect is uncertain. Proponents of E-Cigs say that they are safe and should not be regulated. Opposition is varied, with some opponents proposing that E-Cig usage will introduce a new generation to nicotine addiction, reversing the decline seen with tobacco smoking, or that E-Cigs generally may not be safe and will trigger diseases like tobacco. In this review, we shall discuss what is known about the effects of E-Cigs on the mammalian lung and isolated lung cells in vitro. We hope that collating this data will help illustrate gaps in the knowledge of this burgeoning field, directing researchers toward answering whether or not E-Cigs are capable of causing disease.",

      "abstract": "An energy drink is a type of  beverage  containing stimulant drugs, chiefly  caffeine , which is marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation. They may or may not be  carbonated  and many also contain sugar or other sweeteners,  herbal extracts  and  amino acids . First commercial energy drink was introduced in Europe in 1987 and the sale of these drinks increased rapidly throughout the world. These drinks are based on caffeine which acts through inhibition and activation of various receptors, and thus affects almost all the body systems. There is an increasing body of evidence about the medical hazards of uncontrolled use of these drinks , with neurologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. (1) Mostly the energy drink contains taurine, caffeine, herbal extracts and carbohydrates. These drinks contain caffeine about 80 to 141 mg per cent. (2) Dangers of taking too many energy drinks at one time includes cardiac arrest, headache and migraine, insomnia, addiction to caffeine, nervousness, risky behavior and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Specific effects that have been reported by energy drinks include jitteriness, dizziness, the inability to focus, difficulty concentrating, gastrointestinal upset, and insomnia. Health care providers report that they have also seen the following effects from the consumption of energy drinks: dehydration, accelerated heart rates, anxiety, seizures, acute mania, and strokes. (3) International health organizations have warned the public against consuming such drinks particularly young people under the age of 16, pregnant women and those with cardiac problems and diabetes. (4) Saudi Arabia recently banned the sale of energy drinks at government, health and education facilities and outlawed all forms of advertising for the drinks, including the sponsorship of any sporting, social or cultural events by energy drinks companies. The Cabinet meeting of Saudi Arabia approved number of actions according to the Saudi Press Agency, these includes:  1 - To prohibit advertising of any energy drinks or do advertising or promotional campaigns for any energy drink via any readable, audible or visible media or by any other means.”  2 - To prohibit energy drinks companies, their agents, distributors and marketing associations from sponsoring any sporting, social or cultural event, or taking any procedure leading to promotion.  3 - To prohibit the free distribution of energy drinks to consumers of all age groups.  4 - To prohibit the sale of energy drinks in restaurants and canteens in government facilities; education and health facilities; halls and public and private sports clubs.  5 – Decision has been taken, factory owners and importers of energy drinks shall be committing to writing a text on the tin of any energy drink in Arabic and English languages - warning of the harmful effects of energy drinks.

Animal studies found that bingelike drinking patterns, in which the fetus is exposed to high blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) over relatively short periods of time, are particularly harmful, even if the overall alcohol amount consumed is less than those of more continuous drinking patterns. Long-term studies in humans have confirmed that children of binge-drinking mothers exhibited especially severe cognitive and behavioral deficits. Binge drinking may be particularly harmful because it results in high BACs, may occur during critical periods of brain development, and may be associated with repeated withdrawal episodes.",

      "abstract": "Practitioners who work with elite athletes know that the pressure and considerable rewards involved with success provide a high level of motivation to look for any safe and legal strategy that might enhance performance, even by small margins. Dietary supplements operate in this space, whether they promise a large performance boost or just create the fear that an athlete cannot afford to miss out on what everyone else is using. It is often tempting to overlook the lack of evidence to support the claims made about a supplement on the basis that the stakes are higher for elite athletes; therefore the cost:benefit ratio favours experimentation in the absence of clear proof. Over the past decade, however, we have become aware that the cost of getting it wrong has also escalated for elite athletes. A new hazard related to supplement use has emerged: inadvertent ingestion of substances that are banned under the antidoping codes in place in elite sport, but present in supplement products. In some cases, the level of the presence, or contamination, of banned substances in supplements presents a health hazard for all consumers. In some cases, the concentration may be too small to achieve any health or performance effect but large enough to record an infringement for athletes who submit to doping tests. Newspapers, the internet and Courts of Arbitration in Sport now bear stories of dedicated athletes whose careers have been or are being jeopardised because of the ingestion of a banned substance via a dietary supplement. This problem was first brought to scientific recognition by Hans Geyer and his colleagues from the Centre for Preventive Doping Research in Cologne.

      "title": "Askese in der Konsumgesellschaft",
      "abstract": "Bei immer mehr Personen findet eine Masigung oder die komplette Abstinenz gegen-uber bestimmten Lebens- und Genussmitteln Einzug in den Alltag. Scheinbar wehren wir uns zunehmend gegen die Verlockungen der Warenwelt. So ist seit einiger Zeit auch ein Ruckgang des Konsums tierischer Produkte, Alkohol sowie Nikotin zu verzeichnen. Dabei stellt sich die Frage nach den Ursachen dieser Entwicklung, ob eine asketische Philosophie dahinter steckt oder die Grunde eher profaner Natur sind. Um diese Motive und auch weitere Hintergrunde des Verzichts sowie deren Entwicklungen genauer zu untersuchen, wurden Beitrage aus Online-Foren ausgewertet.\r\nDiese Untersuchungsform hat den Vorteil, dass Meinungen und Diskurse abrufbar sind, welche schon ein vergleichsweise beachtliches Alter aufweisen. Die Erhebung muss also nicht zehn Jahre im Vorfeld geplant und durchgefuhrt werden, sondern kann deutlich spontaner und in einem relativ kurzen Zeitraum erfolgen. Da das Internet im Jahre 2003 bereits recht stark verbreitet war, konnten auch Beitrage aus diesem Jahr bzw. den drauffolgenden Jahren herangezogen werden. Diese wurden dann mit Beitragen vergli-chen, die rund zehn Jahre alter sind. Von besonderem Interesse war dabei, ob sich Ge-meinsamkeiten zwischen den drei Arten der Abstinenz finden lassen.\r\nBezuglich der Beweggrunde zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass gesundheitliche Bedenken ei-nen wesentlicher Faktor darstellen, aber auch der gesellschaftliche Druck und vor allem das nahe Umfeld konnen Personen zu Verzicht und Masigung bewegen. Bei Alkohol und Nikotin ist es auch haufig die Befurchtung, man konnte bei ubermasigem Konsum abhangig werden. Es sind also hauptsachlich pragmatische Uberlegungen, durch welche der Konsum dieser Produkte in heutiger Zeit gezugelt wird. Von Askese kann nur in den seltensten Fallen die Rede sein, etwa beim Fleischverzicht fur das Wohl der Tiere.\r\nIm Zeitverlauf ist erkennbar, dass Abstinenz uberwiegend positiv konnotiert wird und dieses Verhalten auch weiterhin zunimmt. Durch den Verweis auf den gesunden Men-schenverstand versuchen vor allem Befurworter des Verzichts Andersdenkende zu stigmatisieren, (pseudo-)wissenschaftliche Fakten nutzen hingegen beide Seiten, um ihre Argumente zu untermauern. Hedonistische Bekundungen werden insgesamt deutlich seltener, in Form von Gegenreaktionen dafur aber umso starker. Der Ton ist nun insge-samt rauer und die Fronten verharten sich deutlich. Die Reaktionen gegen die zuneh-mende Selbstverstandlichkeit des freiwilligen Verzichts konnten als eine Art Abwehr-verhalten gegenuber des allmahlichen Paradigmenwandels verstanden werden, im Zuge dessen sich die Sicht auf den Konsum bestimmter Produkte bei vielen Menschen zu-nehmend von einem Privileg in eine Bedrohung wandelt.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive substance addiction is difficult to treat, brings huge damage to the body and has negative social and economic consequences for the addicted, their families and society. Rehabilitation therapy is often long and has a high failure rate. For this reason, there is a need for extensive action to minimise the negative effects of psychoactive substance use. Substitution therapy is one of the programmes included in the harm reduction strategy. It involves the replacement of an illicit drug with a legal substance with similar or identical pharmacological effects and is applied in drug addiction therapy. In the case of nicotine addiction, substitution therapy involves taking the same psychoactive substance (nicotine) in a form which is devoid of the majority of other toxic substances that are found in tobacco smoke. The introduction of alternative forms of nicotine supply (electronic cigarettes, non-smoking tobacco products) have renewed the controversy around the topic of efficacy of harm reduction involving the replacement of traditional tobacco products with those with reduced emission of toxic substances, but which still deliver nicotine. According to the opponents of substitution therapy, it prevents one from achieving abstinence that allows for full elimination of harm generated by psychoactive substances. Finding a common platform between the proponents of harm reduction and advocates of complete abstinence-based therapy would be of benefit to the addicted individuals.",

Os dispositivos eletrônicos para fumar, incluindo cigarros eletrônicos (CE), que são produtos operados por bateria e utilizados para inalação de um aerossol, que normalmente contém nicotina, aromatizantes, aditivos de sabor e outros produtos químicos. Sua aparência pode ser similar à de cigarros tradicionais, charutos ou cachimbos, sendo os mais modernos semelhantes a canetas ou pen drives. Salienta-se que o uso de cigarros eletrônicos expõe o organismo a uma variedade de produtos químicos como aqueles adicionados, provenientes do próprio dispositivo (nanopartículas de metal) e, ainda, gerados durante o processo de aquecimento ou vaporização. Esse aparelho, que surgiu como uma alternativa benéfica para proteger a saúde das pessoas e cessar o tabagismo, apresentou-se controverso quanto aos resultados de pesquisas sobre sua eficácia, visto que tais estudos foram financiados pela indústria do cigarro e pesquisas posteriores, não financiadas, apresentaram maior índice de relatos sobre os malefícios do produto. Além disso, seu uso levanta uma questão quanto a dependência psico-comportamental de seus usuários por ele não cessar de forma garantida o hábito de fumar já que apenas substitui o cigarro tradicional pelo eletrônico.",

Desde la ilegalizacion de fumar opio hasta la preocupacion por el narcotrafico, se observan variables que no tienen que ver con los aspectos farmacologicos de las drogas, sino mas bien con razones de politica interna o externa, cuando no de proteccionismo mercantil. Ello ha dado lugar a la distorsion del tema, confundiendose frecuentemente causas con efectos. Se puede demostrar que en un inicio la prohibicion de las drogas tuvo que ver con el racismo; mas tarde con la rebelion juvenil y en la actualidad con problemas de seguridad nacional y, en ocasiones, con problemas economicos de America Latina, predominando siempre la vision de que el problema es externo a los EE.UU. y de que existen drogas buenas y drogas malas.

Comme d’autres prennent leur shoot d’héroïne, certains jeunes passent des heures devant des jeux vidéo, jusqu’à se déscolariser d’abord, se désocialiser complètement ensuite. Des chiffres en attestent : selon l’Observatoire français des drogues et des toxicomanies, un adolescent sur huit en ferait un usage excessif, soit trois élèves par classe en moyenne. Le Conseil économique, social et environnemental affirmait en 2015 que l’addiction aux jeux vidéo était le deuxième motif de consultation médicale après le cannabis. Le « trouble du jeu vidéo », désormais considéré comme une maladie mentale par l’OMS, n’échappe pas aux mécanismes habituels de l’addiction : un individu à l’histoire particulière, une pression sociale de la réussite, et un produit, en l’occurrence le jeu en ligne, intrinsèquement addictogène.",

Une equipe anglaise a calcule le taux d’abstinence dans une population de 5 836 adultes qui avaient decide d’arreter de fumer avec l’aide d’une cigarette electronique, d’un substitut nicotinique en vente libre ou sans aide [2]. Il a ete note un taux d’abstinence plus eleve avec la cigarette electronique qu’avec un substitut nicotinique : OR 1,63 (1,17-2,27) apres ajustement prenant en compte les principales sources de biais comme le degre de dependance. Pour autant, les substituts nicotiniques associes a un soutien psychologique restent la reference dans le sevrage tabagique en raison notamment des incertitudes liees aux risques a long terme de la cigarette electronique. Ces risques sont tres probablement bien moindres que ceux de la cigarette si bien que la position des experts de l’Office francais de prevention du tabagisme parait raisonnable… en attendant d’en savoir plus : « La cigarette electronique peut etre proposee aux fumeurs qui ne veulent pas ou ne reussissent pas a arreter ou a reduire leur tabagisme avec les methodes classiques » [3]. 1.

      "abstract": "Nicotine dependence continues to be a common substance use disorder (SUD) throughout the world in spite of the risks for increased morbidity and mortality for user and others who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. Tobacco control intervention efforts in the US have substantially reduced tobacco use during the past 40 years, however, some subgroups of smokers continue to smoke at high rates. For example, individuals with psychiatric disorders smoke at two to three times the rate of the general population and account for the use of about 44% of all cigarettes consumed in the US. There are effective psychosocial and medication treatments for nicotine dependence. There are seven Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for use in nicotine dependence treatment, including bupropion (Zyban), varenicline (Chantix), and five nicotine replacement medications (patch, gum, spray, inhaler, and lozenge). Psychosocial treatments are also very effective, however, this option has been more difficult to access. Many treatment providers do not offer these psychosocial approaches, however, counseling services are available via internet sites and phone lines. The best treatment outcomes occur with integrated medication and behavioral therapy, however, access to treatment and reimbursement to providers continues to be a barrier.",

Aus diesem Grund startete die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung (BZgA) im Jahr 2001 die Website drugcom.de, die verschiedene Informations- und Beratungsangebote zu den Themen Sucht und Drogen beinhaltet und momentan von rund 2.500 Personen pro Tag genutzt wird. Rund die Hälfte derer, die die drugcom-Selbsttests „Check your Drinking“ und „Cannabis Check“ nutzen, weisen ihren Angaben zufolge einen schädlichen Alkoholkonsum bzw. abhängigen Cannabiskonsum auf. Es kann davon ausgegangen werden, dass nur ein Teil von diesen von sich aus zu einer Konsumreduktion motiviert ist. In der vorgestellten Studie wurde untersucht, ob eine einmalige Chat-Intervention, in der Motivational Interviewing (MI) zur Anwendung kommt, bei diesen Personen zu einem reduzierten Substanzkonsum bzw. einer erhöhten Änderungsbereitschaft führen kann.",

Use of psychoactive substances impacts on academic, social, psychological, economical and physiological development of people with their families negatively. Alcoholic beverages are the most important product of global addiction demand, which is a reason of many deaths and diseases worldwide. Alcohol consumption is a major problem in India because of the various reasons like socio-cultural, difference in alcohol policies and practices state wise, lack of awareness of alcohol related problems, false mass media propaganda, various patterns of alcohol consumption and as a symbol of status both in urban and rural areas across the country. As per people’s opinion, they consumes it because it induces feeling of relaxation and tranquility, suppress anxiety and increases confidence. However with increasing dose, pleasant euphoric starts which means they feels that they are in heaven and that gives way to feelings of depression. That’s why this is called as substance of abuse. This review article focuses on ethyl alcohol (alcohol),its pharmacology,policies in India, different patterns of drinking, prevalence of alcohol consumption globally and nationally, medical and other consequences like suicide and road accidents, harmful effects on the mental, physical and social health with treatment options for alcoholism.",

Through a review of literature relevant to the topic, a reflection is proposed that, among other aspects, classifies drug consumption into two modes, functional and dysfunctional, where in the former, it is used as a \"tool\" for work, without causing impairments to its performance, and in the latter, there is a change in consumption pattern, severely affecting professional performance. In the transition from functional to dysfunctional use, the drug ceases to be a means to become an end in itself, and although this does not occur with the majority of users, the conclusion is that, even in functional use, the individual's relationship with their activity is essentially adaptive, and therefore cannot be considered healthy.",

Electronic cigarette use (vaping) is considered a healthier alternative to cigarette smoking and may help in smoking cessation. However, the effects of vaping are not clear yet and particularly the long-term effects of vaping are largely unknown. Some reports suggest that vaping maybe as harmful for e.g. respiratory function, as cigarette smoking. In this narrative review the effects of vaping and cigarette smoking on respiratory, cardiovascular and muscle function are compared. Overall, vaping has been found to cause similar effects as smoking on lung function and cardiovascular function. Future studies are needed to clarify the severity of smoking- and vaping-induced decrements on muscle function.",

Although there remains some debate, recent evidence suggests that dietary protein need increases with rigorous physical exercise. Those involved in strength training might need to consume as much as 1.6 to 1.7 g protein x kg(-1) x day(-1) (approximately twice the current RDA) while those undergoing endurance training might need about 1.2 to 1.6 g x kg(-1) x day(-1) (approximately 1.5 times the current RDA). Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these recommendations and asses whether these protein intakes can enhance exercise performance. Despite the frequently expressed concern about adverse effects of high protein intake, there is no evidence that protein intakes in the range suggested will have adverse effects in healthy individuals.",

      "abstract": "The urge to drink, also often referred to as craving, is an emotional state in which a person is motivated to seek and use alcohol. In abstinent alcoholics, this urge may contribute to the risk of relapse. Researchers have developed several models--including the conditioned withdrawal model, conditioned appetitive motivational model, social learning model, and information-processing model--to describe the role of urges in relapse. Several studies have evaluated the role of urges in predicting alcoholism treatment outcome and relapse. Some findings indicate that the degree of urge an alcoholic experiences when confronted with a simulated high-risk situation at the end of alcoholism treatment can predict subsequent drinking. Other studies, however, show inconsistent results regarding the role of urges in predicting treatment outcome. Overall, the study results suggest that urges do not necessarily increase the risk of relapse but may actually protect some drinkers against further drinking.",

      "title": "Is there a place for cutting‐down‐to‐stop in smoking cessation support?",
      "abstract": "Conflicting evidence on the relative efficacy of cutting-down-to-stop (CDTS) versus quitting smoking abruptly could suggest that CDTS does help people to stop smoking, but is favoured by people who find it more difficult to quit. Future research should investigate this, and ways to implement and maximize the effectiveness of CDTS. Historically, guidelines and health professionals have recommended people stop smoking abruptly by smoking as normal until a 'quit day'. However, approximately half of people reduce their smoking before quitting 1, 2. This may involve reducing before a specified quit day or reducing consumption while aiming to stop at an indeterminate point in the future. In this editorial, we use the term cutting-down-to-stop (CDTS) to include both approaches. For people who cannot or will not quit abruptly, providing a CDTS option could increase the likelihood that people attempt to quit and use aids to cessation, such as support or medication, so increasing their chances of success 3. However, even if offering CDTS alongside abrupt quitting draws more people into services, it could be damaging if it results in lower quit rates than stopping smoking abruptly. This is because people who would previously have attempted abrupt quitting may find CDTS more appealing, and choose the less effective option. Therefore, research has explored the relative efficacy of the two approaches, but conflicting results have hampered interpretation. US- 4 and UK-based 1 surveys have found that people who chose CDTS were less likely to stop smoking than people who chose to quit abruptly, and results from one large, rigorously conducted randomized trial are consonant. The Rapid Reduction Trial (RRT) tested the effectiveness of behavioural support for CDTS compared with abrupt quitting 5. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was used before and after the quit day in both trial arms. Both at 4 weeks and 6 months follow-up, abstinence was more likely in the abrupt arm. However, a Cochrane Review pooled 22 trials comparing CDTS with abrupt quitting, including RRT, and showed no evidence of a difference [risk ratio (RR) = 1.01, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.87–1.17] 6. These contrasting findings provide pointers for research and practice. RRT was the only trial in the Cochrane Review to find a statistically significant benefit of abrupt quitting 6. This may be due to the nicotine pre-loading (i.e. pre-quit NRT), which has been found to increase abstinence rates compared with not using NRT before quitting 7. Nicotine patch pre-loading seems more effective than pre-loading with fast-acting NRT (e.g. gum and lozenges), which may be due to the supranormal higher blood concentrations of nicotine observed 8. Although participants in the CDTS arm of RRT used both patches and fast-acting NRT, they also reduced their cigarette consumption by an average 69%, potentially undermining the effect of pre-loading by reducing nicotine concentrations. Surveys suggesting that abrupt quitting is superior to CDTS may have been subject to residual confounding. People who chose CDTS may have been more addicted, less motivated to quit or those who had struggled to quit previously; for example, those with mental health problems 9. This is supported by an analysis from RRT, which found that participants who favoured CDTS at baseline were significantly less likely to be abstinent 6 months later compared to those who favoured abrupt quitting, regardless of the trial arm to which they were randomized 5. Observational studies have not adjusted for all of these potential confounders 1, 4. Another factor that could be affecting the success of CDTS is the way people attempt to reduce their smoking. There is only one way to quit abruptly, but there are many ways to reduce 6; for example, by varying the duration of the reduction period and setting a quit date to work towards or not. Some of these approaches may be more successful than others. There is very little research examining the effectiveness of different methods, but there is some evidence that achieving greater reduction 10, 11, receiving behavioural support rather than self-help resources and using fast-acting NRT or varenicline as an aid may improve quit rates 6. Finally, retrospective recall in surveys of abrupt cessation versus CDTS may be biased. Quitting smoking is often a long process, made up of many different cessation attempts 12 and strategies 13, 14. Even if participants ultimately stop smoking their last cigarettes abruptly, they may have previously reduced their consumption. Looking back, they may not remember or consider reduction that occurred before their most recent, explicit decision to quit, although it may have contributed to their ability to initiate a quit attempt and their ultimate success 15. The evidence discussed above has aimed to establish whether abrupt quitting or CDTS is more likely to help someone who has already decided to quit smoking to stop successfully 1, 4-6. However, the data do not definitively tell us whether promoting CDTS undermines or promotes overall quit attempts and the uptake of evidence-based treatment. Evidence suggests that people do not view CDTS and abrupt quitting as mutually exclusive, and may switch between the two approaches after deciding to change their smoking behaviour 13, 14. Therefore, offering both strategies could increase access to evidence-based treatment. This may be particularly important if CDTS appeals to people who would not otherwise be motivated to quit, but whom evidence suggests could benefit from this approach 16. We suggest that clinicians provide treatment tailored to an individual's preference, willingness or perceived ability to CDTS or quit abruptly with the goal of increasing the percentage of people making quit attempts and using evidence-based support. Evidence suggests that providing behavioural support and using varenicline or fast-acting NRT while reducing may increase people's chances of quitting, and will not put people at a disadvantage when compared with quitting abruptly 6. Research should examine who chooses CDTS versus abrupt quitting, and how those choices are shaped by policy interventions. Based on the evidence presented in this editorial we hypothesize that particularly 'hard-to-reach populations' may prefer CDTS, and so trials and complementary qualitative assessments of their acceptability in these populations would be especially helpful.

      "abstract": "The most dangerous and deadly form of tobacco consumption, burning and inhaling tobacco cigarettes, is still free. Total eradication will not be possible for many reasons. Cigarettes have the connotation of the free world and prohibition would not only affect and criminalise marginalised people but also well respected members of our societies. So any attempt to curb the cigarette smoking should be welcomed by all exponents of public health. The dangerousness of cigarettes stems from burning tobacco and thus inhaling numerous toxic ingredients. E-cigs avoid the toxic by-products vaporising the nicotine. The public debate on e-cigs is quite bizarre. Should they fall under tobacco or pharmaceutical laws or others? The arguments against e-cigs follow basically 2 lines. Firstly it is contended that 60mg of nicotine are lethal (e.g. in Tobacco Atlas). Nicotine can be lethal but only in doses of 0.5g–1g or more. Secondly it is said that vapouring paves the way to cigarette smoking, which has not been observed despite enormous growth of the e-cig market. Recently Swiss experts spoke out for allowing nicotine containing fluids in a Delphi study under regulations (e.g. no advertising). So far the sale of nicotine containing fluids is forbidden in Switzerland.",

ENDS come in a variety of forms, but regardless of form generally consist of a solution containing humectant (e.g., propylene glycol or glycerol), flavorings, and usually nicotine (some solutions do not contain nicotine); a battery-powered coil that heats the solution into an aerosol (usually referred to as vapor) in an atomizing chamber; and a mouthpiece through which the user draws the vapor into the mouth and lungs. The devices may be closed systems containing prefilled cartridges, or open systems, where the user manually refills a 1-2 ml. tank with solution. What started as closed-system cigarette-shaped devices marketed as an adjunct for smoking cessation, has transitioned rapidly to literally thousands of hip and funky-designed open-system hookah pens, vape pens, and modifiable devices. For younger people, these forms are the “in” thing, while traditional cigarette-shaped devices are “out.”",

      "abstract": "Vape-pens or electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are handheld battery powered devices that use a vape-liquid to produce a vapor that is inhaled by the user. The active ingredients in commercial vape-liquids are commonly nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol. A consequence of the rise in e-cigarette usage was the 2019 emergence of a vaping-induced respiratory disease denoted ‘e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury’ (EVALI). One of the suspected causes of EVALI is Vitamin E Acetate (VEA), which was found to be a diluent in certain illicit tetrahydrocannabinol vape-pens, whereas nicotine is commonly diluted in equal parts propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (PG:VG). The prevalent use of e-cigarettes by both adult and young adult populations and the emergence of a novel illness has made understanding how e-cigarette vapors affect our respiratory tissues a public health concern. We have designed and produced a simple device that can operate commercial e-cigarettes and deliver the vapor to a chamber containing a standard cell culture multi-well plate. Here we utilize our device to investigate how human airway mucociliary tissue cultures respond after chronic exposure to vapors produced from either PG:VG or VEA. We note several differences between how PG:VG and VEA vapors interact with and alter airway tissue cultures and suggest potential mechanisms for how VEA-vapors can exacerbate EVALI symptoms. Our device combined with primary human airway tissue cultures make an economical and compact model system that allows for animal-free investigations into the acute and chronic consequences of e-cigarette vapors on primary respiratory cells.",

Coping bezeichnet alle Strategien, die zu einer Reduzierung von Stress eingesetzt werden, auch wenn sie nicht unbedingt dieses Ziel erfüllen. In einer Querschnittstudie wurde an 70 cannabisabhängigen Jugendlichen und 90 unauffälligen Jugendlichen untersucht, in wieweit sich deren Copingverhalten voneinander unterscheidet und ob beide Gruppen ähnlich erfolgreich in der Bewältigung ihrer Stressoren sind.

Damit wurde die psychische Belastung, funktionale und dysfunktionale Copingstile in verschiedenen Alltagsbereichen, Alltagsstressoren in denselben Bereichen sowie kritische Lebensereignisse erfasst. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass cannabisabhängige Jugendliche mehr kritische Lebensereignisse berichteten, mehr externalisierende Verhaltensauffälligkeiten zeigten und auch dysfunktionalere Copingstrategien einsetzten.

Smoking is a major health issue in this population, but is often overlooked by health professionals.This article examines the relationship between smoking and depression, and reviews the evidence for the use of specific therapies in general practice.All patients with depression should be asked if they smoke. Smokers with depression have higher nicotine dependence and, after quitting, experience more severe negative moods and are at increased risk of major depression. However, they are motivated to quit and many achieve long term abstinence. Effective strategies for smoking cessation in this population include cognitive behavioural mood management, nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion. Additional support and longer courses of treatment may be needed. Smokers with depression should be monitored for mood changes after quitting. Preventive antidepressants may have a role in high-risk cases, especially for those with recurrent depression.",

Un uso adeguato del framing del messaggio puo rendere la comunicazione alimentare piu efficace, promuovendo scelte piu sane.

In una serie di studi sperimentali abbiamo indagato i fattori che possono influenzare l’efficacia della comunicazione alimentare rivolta agli anziani. E emerso che i messaggi possono essere persuasivi sia ponendo l’accento sulla dimensione della salute sia su quella del benessere, finora relativamente meno esplorata.

Because smoking poses detrimental effects on the treatment of psychiatric illnesses, as well as on the health of the patient, tailored and more intensive smoking cessation counseling should be offered to individuals with mental illnesses.",

Spadamo med tako imenovane »mokre« kulture, saj je tolerantnost do alkohola v Sloveniji kar velika, ker je uživanje le-tega prisotno v vsakdanjem življenju. Mladostniki pravijo, da s pridobivanjem alkoholnih pijac nimajo težav in da uživajo v pitju zaradi okusa in ucinkov, ki jih ima alkohol. Mladostnike zunanji vplivi prepricujejo, da brez alkohola ni vec zabave, zato se vse vec mladostnikov zateka k pitju, vendar pa se ne zavedajo njegovih skodljivih posledic. Alkohol ima na cloveka tako telesne kot tudi psiholoske in socialne vplive, privede lahko do invalidnosti in povzroci tudi smrt. Uživanje alkohola v dobi mladostnika, predvsem pitje do pijanosti, je zaskrbljujoce, saj ima tako kratkorocne kot dolgorocne posledice. Namen: Namen diplomskega dela je ugotoviti problematiko tveganega pitja alkohola in alkoholnih zastrupitev pri mladostnikih. Metode dela: Uporabljena je bila deskriptivna metoda dela, ki je vkljucevala pregled domace in tuje literature. Pregledani so bili strokovni in znanstveni clanki v angleskem in slovenskem jeziku, pisna gradiva ter aktualne spletne strani. Razprava in zakljucek: Za zmanjsanje posledic, ki nastanejo kot posledica opijanja oziroma pitja alkohola, je potrebno dobro zacrtati alkoholno politiko in vztrajno delati na preventivi, potrebno je ustvariti odgovornejsi odnos do alkohola v družbi in v solsko okolje uvesti preventivne programe, katerih namen je preprecevanje skodljivega pitja. Pomembno vlogo imajo tudi medicinske sestre, ki z mladostniki preživijo najvec casa, zato je pomembno, da se dodatno izobražujejo iz specialnih znanj, saj le tako delujejo ucinkovito in uspesno zdravstveno vzgojno. Zdravstveno vzgojno pa lahko na otroke in mladostnike delujejo v vrtcih, solah, v skupnosti ter v okviru preventivnih in sistematicnih pregledov.",

Dopamine is not only a key regulator of learning and motivation, but also a core substance that regulates the human body. Depression and Parkinson's disease are often associated with a lack of dopamine. Moreover, smoking is addictive, and its main mechanism is also closely related to dopamine: nicotine can cause a burst of dopamine neurons. Another substance with similar effects to dopamine is endorphins. Endorphins attach to morphine receptors and cause the same pain alleviation and pleasure that morphine and other opiates do, similar to a sense of accomplishment. Endorphins bring pleasure, but also lead to drug abuse. Opiate addiction is a severe public health issue that affects a huge proportion of population. People who take drugs produce dopamine and endorphins, and their mental dependence on drugs far exceeds the benefits of dopamine and endorphins.",

However, longitudinal studies that unravel cohort from aging effects observe that when people age, they generally limit alcohol use. There is much heterogeneity in changes in alcohol use among older adults. Physical changes in ability to metabolize alcohol, changing policies toward alcohol use, the higher exposure to risk factors that may induce problem drinking and increased morbidity all contribute to this heterogeneity. The overall picture that the new generation of older people drinks more than previous generations warrants increased attention for older problem drinkers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hookah or waterpipe smoking or use is an emerging trend in the US population, especially among the youth. The misperception of hookah being less harmful than cigarettes and the availability of different but “appealing” flavors are considered among the main reasons for this trend. Hookah users however are exposed to many of the same toxic compounds/by-products as cigarette users, but at dramatically higher levels, which might lead to more severe negative health effects. In fact, hookah users are at risks of infections, cancers, lung disease, and other medical conditions. Moreover, because of the overlapping toxicant/chemical profile to conventional cigarettes, hookah smoke effects on the cardiovascular system are thought to be comparable to those of conventional cigarettes. A major source of tobacco addiction is nicotine, whose levels in hookah are extremely variable as they depend on the type of tobacco used. Taken together, in this review of literature, we will provide insights on the negative health effects of hookah in general, with a focus on what is known regarding its impact on the cardiovascular system.",

      "title": "SHAREABLE RESOURCE",
      "abstract": "A RELUCTANCE TO CONTACT. Haphephobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by an intense fear of being touched without consent. Among the symptoms of this condition are immediate anxiety after being touched or when contemplating being touched, avoidance of situations where the person may be touched, and panic attacks. The most common strategy for dealing with this aversion to being touched entails a variety of types of behavioral therapy, as well as coping mechanisms, such as relaxation techniques. PASSING THROUGH. Excessive flatulence is generally an indication that a person either has a digestive system disorder or is experiencing a sensitivity to a particular food. As a rule, flatulence occurs for a number of reasons. One possibility involves the fact that individuals tend to swallow a bit of air as they eat or drink. Then as the air makes its way to the intestines, it is released as a burp or leaves the body as gas. Gas also is a by-product of natural activity in the digestive system. The bacteria that live in the gut create different gases as they break down food, which are subsequently expelled as flatulence. HAIR TODAY, GONE TOMORROW. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that typically results in an unpredictable hair loss. This condition leads to the loss of hair in patches, approximately the size of a quarter. The attendant loss can range from a few patches to a more extreme level of total baldness. Although no cure currently exists for the disorder, some forms of treatment can help individuals regrow their hair more quickly, such as corticosteroids—anti-inflammatory drugs. PUMPING UP. Edema is the buildup of fluids in the ankles, feet, and legs, which leads to swelling. This condition is a common problem, especially among older adults. There are a number of factors that can cause edema, including problems with the body’s lymphatic system, long-term protein deficiency, weakness in the veins, kidney complications, cirrhosis of the liver, and congestive heart failure. Among the treatment options for this condition are wearing compression socks, elevating the legs whenever possible, losing weight, soaking the feet and ankles in Epsom salts, and taking magnesium supplements. ONLY THE NOSE KNOWS. Nonallergic rhinitis entails chronic sneezing or a congested, drippy nose with no apparent cause. The exact triggers that cause the blood vessels in the nose to expand, filling the nasal lining with blood and fluid, are unknown. However, there are several possible catalysts, including environmental irritants; reaction to particular medications, infections, food, and beverages; and sleep-related issues. Avoiding the potential irritants, using antihistamine or steroid nasal sprays, and taking antihistamine tablets are among the common treatments for the condition. EARSPLITTING. Hyperacusis is a condition that occurs when a person’s hearing becomes oversensitive to certain sounds, making them seem louder than they really are. The disorder, which is caused by changes in how the brain processes sound, is usually centered on certain sound frequencies. Among the factors that can lead to these changes are damage to the cochlea (from exposure to loud noise), a head injury, Lyme disease, Bell’s palsy, PTSD, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common treatment for the condition is to wear a special hearing aid. TO PEE OR NOT TO PEE? Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control, a relatively common and often embarrassing problem. The severity of the condition ranges from a person leaking urine when they cough or sneeze to experiencing an urge to urinate, which is so strong that the individual does not get to the toilet in time. Urinary incontinence is not a disease but rather a symptom of a wide range of both short-term (e.g., urinary tract infection, constipation, and medicine) and long-term (e.g., diabetes, multiple sclerosis, enlarged prostate for men, and childbirth for women) health issues. Among the treatments that can help a person take control over their bladder are making lifestyle changes, taking medication, and undergoing surgery. IMPULSIVITY PERSONIFIED. Excoriation disorder is a repetitive, compulsive picking and scratching at the skin, to the point where serious tissue damage occurs. The condition is usually chronic, with periods of remission alternating with periods of greater symptom intensity. Although no specific cause has been identified for the disorder, evidence exists suggesting a genetic predisposition to the condition. Both medication and cognitive behavioral therapy have been found to possibly reduce the symptoms of the disorder. THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental illness characterized by a person being persistently preoccupied with at least one perceived flaw in their appearance. Individuals with this condition may frequently examine their appearance in the mirror, constantly compare how they look to others, and regularly try to avoid social situations or having their photo taken. As a rule, treatment includes undergoing counseling and taking antidepressant medicine. SWEETS BE DAMNED. A sugar intolerance is a condition in which an individual has difficulty in either digesting or processing sugar. This nutritional state, which is relatively common, causes a range of digestive issues that tend to vary from person to person. The basic way to treat sugar intolerance is to identify the triggers that are causing the condition and to eliminate those foods from the diet.",

Diese positive Entwicklung ist sicherlich auch auf Maßnahmen zurückzuführen, die im Zuge einer verstärkten Tabakkontrollpolitik in Deutschland umgesetzt wurden.

Specifically, we manipulated haptic weight sensations by varying the weight of the cup/container (e.g., champagne flute) alcohol was consumed from and showed that consuming champagne from lighter (vs. heavier) flutes leads to enhanced positive feelings, reduced negative feelings, and increased perceived intoxication.",

      "abstract": "Résumé L'utilisation et la prédiction de la consommation de drogues et d'alcool chez les femmes de 65 ans et plus ont été étudies au moyen de données tirées de l'Enquête nationale sur l'alcool et les autres drogues (1989). L'utilisation est la même que celles obtenues d'enquêtes antérieures; c'est-à-dire que les femmes plus âgées consomment moins d'alcool, fument moins et utilisent moins de drogues illégales que les autres groupes d'âge et de sexe. Également concordants avec d'autres études, le taux de consommation de médicaments psycholeptiques avec prescription médicale est plus élevé chez les femmes âgées qu'au sein de tout autre groupe. Des analyses bivariées ont démontré une relation significative entre certaines variables sociales et démographiques, et la consommation de drogues et d'alcool. La consommation d'alcool était le fait de personnes célibataires, jeunes, non pratiquantes, en bonne santé et fumant. La consommation de tabac est plus importante chez les personnes plus jeunes, non pratiquantes, en moins bonne santé, bénéficiant moins de soutiens sociaux, consommant de l'alcool et utilisant des médicaments psycholeptiques sous prescription médicale. L'utilisation de ces médicaments (partitulièrement les somnifères) était plutôt le fait de femmes veuves, plus âgées, devotes, en moins bonne santé, ayant un niveau de scolarité moins élevé et un revenu moins élevé, devant faire face à des situations très stressantes, bénéficiant moins de soutien social, fumant et consommant d'autres médicaments psycholeptiques sous prescription médicale. L'analyse des données, réalisée au moyen d'une analyse de composantes principales, a révélé deux dimensions concordantes de la consommation de drogues et d'alcool chez les femmes âgées: une plus grande religiosité associée à une moindre consommation de tabac et d'alcool d'une part et, d'autre part, la consommation de médicaments psycholeptiques de prescription médicale de toutes sortes. Ces résultats sont discutés en fonction de l'utilisation prévue des femmes âgées de demain et du besoin de mieux comprendre le contexte social de la consommation de drogues et d'alcool chez les femmes âgées, où la consommationm d'alcool va de légère à modéreé, mais où le taux de consommation de médicaments psycholeptiques sous prescription medicale est plus élevé qu'au sein de tout autre groupe d'âge et de sexe.",

      "abstract": "The health of future generations, both physical and psychological, depends upon good parental and early environment, free particularly from malnutrition, toxins and undue stress. Education about these negative influences is urgent, especially to encourage childbearing women in a healthy diet and lifestyle. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoking in pregnancy have been known since the 1970s, yet in Germany, for example, 60% of all children are conceived, carried, born into a household where at least one adult smokes. Even if the father desists from smoking at home, the nicotine in his body tissues is transmitted to anyone near him, for example his wife when they sleep near each other. More than one glass of beer, wine or spirits per week during the pregnancy can be detected at birth. Alcohol in early in the pregnancy – just when many mothers are unaware they are pregnant – can produce significant physical malformation, especially in the face. Prenatal exposure to alcohol has significant effects on the intelligence and behaviour of the child. Many of these children are very restless. Even slight amounts of poisoning during the pregnancy are related to the development of a negative seli-image and the compensatory behaviour of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder in later life. The Prenatal Deprivation and Poisoning Syndromes have not only been related to heart disease and eating disorders in the area of general health but also in the area of psychological health to the Borderline Personality Disorder. Undue stress of any kind during the pregnancy leads to problems for the developing child.",

However, most clients do agree music that promotes violence is never very helpful. The chapter shows that clients often find a spiritual practice helps them cope with their voices, or with the anxiety which arises from hearing voices. Finding an activity to distract from the voices is a popular way clients cope. Group clients frequently say they notice a correlation between substance use and their voices. When clients use street drugs and/or alcohol, they notice their voices become more pronounced, nastier, and/or scarier. When these clients discontinue their substance use or cut way back, the voices recede. Tracking voices has helped many clients recognize their triggers and make lifestyle adjustments.",

      "abstract": "Proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms relating gastroesophageal reflux disease to cigarette smoking are reviewed. Acute experiments have shown that smokers have chronically diminished lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and that periods of smoking are associated with an increased rate of reflux events. Reflux occurred primarily by the 'abdominal strain mechanism' rather than by transient LES relaxation. Smoking also caused chronically diminished salivary function that results in prolonged acid clearance time. Thus, smoking potentially increases esophageal acid exposure, both by increases in the number of reflux events, and a prolongation of the esophageal acid clearance time.",

      "abstract": "The proceedings of the second annual scientific conference of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco are summarized. The goal of the annual conference was to disseminate information about ongoing nicotine research from biological, behavioral and social perspectives. Data were presented describing our current understanding of the structure and function of neuronal nicotinic acetycholine receptors, by which nicotine exerts most, if not all, of its effects in the brain. The conformational complexity of receptor subunits expressed in different brain areas contributes significantly to the complexity of responses observed to nicotinic agonists. Nicotine is being developed as a medication that might be used to maintain smoking cessation and to treat various medical diseases. The potential toxicity of nicotine, apart from cigarette smoking, is an important variable in assessing the benefits and risks of such therapeutic applications. The risks of nicotine-containing medications appear to be far less than those associated with tobacco use. Recent data indicate that cigarette smoking is increasing among youth in the United States. Adolescent smokers are interested in quitting and make frequent quit attempts, but are usually not successful. Effective methods are needed to manage adolescent smokers before they become heavily addicted. Nicotine replacement as a pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation has made a significant contribution in improving quit rates. New medications have been developed that target specific populations of smokers.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes and arrhythmogenesis: a comprehensive review of pre-clinical studies and their clinical implications",
      "abstract": "Abstract Electronic cigarette use has grown exponentially in recent years, and while their popularity has increased, the long-term effects on the heart are yet to be fully studied and understood. Originally designed as devices to assist with those trying to quit traditional combustible cigarette use, their popularity has attracted use by teens and adolescents who traditionally have not smoked combustible cigarettes. Acute effects on the heart have been shown to be similar to traditional combustible cigarettes, including increased heart rate and blood pressure. The main components of electronic cigarettes that contribute to these arrhythmic effects are found in the e-liquid that is aerosolized and inhaled, comprised of nicotine, flavourings, and a combination of vegetable glycerin (VG) and propylene glycol (PG). Nicotine can potentially induce both ventricular and atrial arrhythmogenesis, with both the atrial and ventricular effects resulting from the interactions of nicotine and the catecholamines they release via potassium channels. Atrial arrhythmogenesis, more specifically atrial fibrillation, can also occur due to structural alterations, which happens because of nicotine downregulating microRNAs 133 and 590, both post-transcriptional growth factor repressors. Liquid flavourings and the combination of PG and VG can possibly lead to arrhythmic events by exposing users to acrolein, an aldehyde that stimulates TRPA1 that in turn causes a change towards sympathetic activation and autonomic imbalance. The design of these electronic delivery devices is constantly changing; therefore, it has proven extremely difficult to study the long-term effects on the heart caused by electronic cigarettes but will be important to understand given their rising popularity. The arrhythmic effects of electronic cigarettes appear similar to traditional cigarettes as well; however, a comprehensive review has not been compiled and is the focus of this article.",

      "abstract": "Obwohl Muttermilch die beste Ernährung in den ersten Lebensmonaten ist, können sich Risiken für den gestillten Säugling ergeben. Dieser Artikel gibt einen Überblick zur Relevanz von Fremdstoffen und Krankheitserregern in der Muttermilch für das gestillte Kind. Betrachtet werden Medikamente, Rauchen, Alkohol- bzw. Kaffeekonsum, persistente Umweltkontaminanten und Rückstände sowie Infektionen. Bei angezeigter Arzneimitteltherapie lassen sich für die meisten Erkrankungen Medikamente finden, die keine längeren Stillpausen oder sogar Abstillen erfordern. Bei einer Langzeitbehandlung, insbesondere unter Kombinationstherapie, muss dies jedoch im Einzelfall geprüft werden. Auf Rauchen und den Konsum von Alkohol sollte in der Stillzeit verzichtet werden, während der Verzehr von bis zu zwei Tassen Kaffee täglich unproblematisch ist. Die gegenwärtigen Gehalte der in Deutschland relevanten Umweltkontaminanten und Rückstände in der Muttermilch sind als unbedenklich anzusehen; hier ist bemerkenswert, dass sich die vor mehr als 20 Jahren als kritisch betrachtete Dioxinbelastung bis heute um den Faktor 10 hat reduzieren lassen. Eine mütterliche Infektion mit dem Human Immunodeficiency-Virus (HIV) stellt in Ländern mit ausreichendem Hygienestandard eine der wenigen medizinischen Indikationen zum Abstillen dar. Insgesamt sind die Risiken durch Fremdstoffe und Krankheitserreger in der Muttermilch beim ausschließlich gestillten Säugling in der Regel gering und stellen somit üblicherweise keinen Grund für längere Stillpausen oder ein Abstillen dar. Nur in wenigen Einzelfällen (bestimmte Medikamente, HIV-Infektion) ist ein Abstillen im Interesse der Gesundheit des Kindes zu empfehlen.",

      "title": "e‐Cigarettes for smoking cessation: Do they deliver?",
      "abstract": "What is known and objective Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are battery-powered devices that allow nicotine and/or other substances to be inhaled in aerosolized form. e-Cigarettes (electronic cigarettes), the most commonly used ENDS, have been proposed to be smoking cessation aids. However, despite the rapid surge in their popularity, little is known about long-term health consequences of e-cigarette usage. We assess published data to see if they deliver what they promise. Comment e-Cigarettes may contain uncertain quantities of various ingredients, and evidence of adulteration has been identified. Flavouring agents can alter the pharmacokinetics of nicotine and have uncertain impact on the nature of e-cigarette use (eg ab initio use vs smoking cessation). What is new and conclusion Although e-cigarettes have been proposed to be a safe approach to encouraging smoking cessation, there are inconsistencies in available data. And further data are needed regarding long-term implications of primary and secondary exposure to e-cigarette products.",

      "title": "Determinantes de las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva, dependencia a la nicotina y estadios del cambio en fumadores",
      "abstract": "Antecedentes La adiccion a los cigarrillos se debe principalmente a la nicotina que contienen, pero poco se conoce sobre su dosificacion en fumadores. La medicion de la cotinina, el principal metabolito de la nicotina, ayuda a caracterizar la dosis de nicotina recibida por los fumadores, reflejando diferencias en la conducta tabaquica y en la motivacion para dejar de fumar, en el tipo de cigarrillos fumados y en el metabolismo de la nicotina en diferentes poblaciones. Hipotesis 1. El numero de cigarrillos fumados sera el principal determinante de las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva: las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva se incrementaran al incrementar el consumo de cigarrillos. 2. Las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva seran mayores cuanto menor tiempo haya transcurrido desde que el fumador se despierta hasta que fuma el primer cigarrillo. 3. Los fumadores mas dependientes tendran concentraciones de cotinina en saliva mas altas que los fumadores menos dependientes. 4. Los fumadores muy dependientes y con altas concentraciones de cotinina en saliva estaran menos preparados para dejar de fumar. Objetivos 1. Caracterizar la distribucion de las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva en fumadores y los factores que la influencian. 2. Estudiar la asociacion entre el tiempo transcurrido hasta el primer cigarrillo fumado despues de despertarse y la concentracion de cotinina en saliva. 3. Analizar la relacion entre la dependencia a la nicotina y las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva. 4. Estudiar la preparacion para dejar de fumar (estadios del cambio de Prochaska y DiClemente) de acuerdo al perfil de dependencia y los niveles de cotinina en saliva. Metodologia Los datos provienen de dos estudios independientes. Uno de ellos es un estudio transversal (2004-2005) de una muestra representativa de la poblacion general de Barcelona (n=1245), en el que se utilizo un cuestionario sobre tabaquismo y exposicion pasiva al humo del tabaco, asi como una muestra de saliva para determinar la concentracion de cotinina. El otro tambien es un estudio transversal (2006) de una muestra representativa de la poblacion espanola ?l8 anos (n=2522), en el que se utilizo una entrevista telefonica sobre consumo de tabaco y exposicion al humo ambiental del tabaco. Se calcularon medias y desviaciones estandar o medianas y rangos intercuartilicos, segun fuera apropiado, para describir los datos. Se utilizaron analisis descriptivos y modelos de regresion multiple en funcion de los objetivos propuestos. Resultados Las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva aumentaron a mayor consumo de cigarrillos hasta llegar aproximadamente a los 20 cigarrillos, nivel donde las concentraciones de cotinina se estabilizaban. El consumo diario de cigarrillos, el momento del dia en que se fuma mas y el tiempo transcurrido desde que el fumador se despierta hasta que fuma su primer cigarrillo estuvieron significativamente relacionados con la concentracion de cotinina en saliva. Este ultimo en particular demostro ser un buen indicador de dependencia. Por otra parte, no se observo una asociacion entre las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva y los estadios del cambio, si bien en cada estadio se observo que las concentraciones de cotinina aumentaban a mayor consumo de cigarrillos, a mayor nivel de dependencia y a menor tiempo transcurrido hasta fumar el primer cigarrillo del dia. Conclusiones Las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva estan relacionadas con el consumo diario de cigarrillos, el tiempo transcurrido hasta fumar el primer cigarrillo del dia y el nivel de dependencia a la nicotina, no asi con los estadios del cambio en los que se encuentran los fumadores. El consumo diario de cigarrillos, el tiempo hasta fumar el primer cigarrillo y el momento del dia en que se fuma mas son buenos indicadores del nivel de dependencia del fumador.",

      "title": "Nutraceutical Intervention for Treatment of Alcoholism and Drinking Problems",
      "abstract": "Alcoholism is an obsession characterized by a lasting craving for alcohol. Unlike alcohol addicts, who drink too much but are not dependent on alcohol, alcoholics feel an obligation to drink overpoweringly. Despite its mental and societal sequelae, alcohol addiction is basically a mental ailment. Various medicinal plants and herbs such as Silybum marianum, Pueraria lobata, Taraxacum officinale, Ganoderma lucidum, Passiflora edulis, Artemisia absinthium, Hypericum perforatum, and Tabernanthe iboga including some other lesser known plants Ginseng and Cayenne pepper can be active either as a prime therapy or in combination with conservative remedies. Although various chemotherapies are available, the practice of herbs and plants for treating alcohol addiction has numerous benefits such as no side effects, no toxicity, natural, effective, and safe. The present review would focus on the health abuse of alcoholism and the role of herbs and medicinal plants (importance, medicinal value, benefits, and the mode of action) in handling the intoxication and drinking problem.",

      "title": "Food Interactions With Once-A-Day Theophylline Preparations: A Review",
      "abstract": "AbstractAt present, theophylline is used predominantly as sustained-release dosage forms. Since the mid-seventies many such products have been introduced and have found huge application for use with a dosage interval of 12 hr (‘twice-a-day’ preparations). Since 1983 theophylline has also been available as preparations that can be given with an interval of 24 hr (‘once-a-day’ preparations). The release of theophylline from sustained-release dosage forms can be influenced (either increased or decreased) by concomitant intake of food. Obviously, ultra-slow-releasing products are most vulnerable to food effects. With some preparations the composition of the meal, especially its fat content, determines the degree of the food effect. The effect of meal timing and content on once-a-day theophylline preparations must be known since rather large doses are ingested all at a single time. If food can alter the release of theophylline in an unexpected manner from ultra-slow preparations, drug effectiveness may be impaired if release is inhibited or toxicity might result if sudden release of drug occurs. Herein, information about food interaction with once-a-day theophylline preparations is reviewed as this topic is important both for clinicians as well as those concerned with chronopharmacologic investigations of such medications.Key Words: Once-a-day theophyllinemeal effectsmeal fat contentDilatrane A.P.®Theo-24®Theo-Dur®Uniphyl®Uniphyllin®",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Introduction: The first year of military service in the Air Force is a particularly vulnerable time for tobacco use. All enlisted Air Force recruits are required to remain tobacco free for the first 12 weeks. Despite the fact that a majority of Airmen express confidence that they will not use tobacco, most will return to smoking and many nonsmokers initiate once the ban is lifted. Understanding the factors associated with cigarette smoking initiation among non-users and re-initiation among former users is critical for the development of successful tobacco use interventions.",
