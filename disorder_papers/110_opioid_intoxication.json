      "title": "Cognitive Effects and Sedation",
      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

It is also believed by some that the best way to address this perceived problem is to avoid using opioids altogether or to severely limit the use of prescription opioids, especially after surgery. It is further believed by some that severely limiting the number of prescriptions will greatly reduce the number of deaths due to opioid overdoses occurring as a consequence of the opioid epidemic. There is, however, substantial evidence that this is not the case. This review/commentary explores this evidence in the context of organizations, researchers, and clinicians that strive to further drastically decrease or eliminate the use of prescription opioids.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reviews the management of the most important opioid adverse effects. Opioid analgesics are certainly the mainstay of cancer pain therapy. Certain adverse effects of opioids have traditionally been considered most relevant due to their potential impact or high prevalence. The likelihood of opioid toxicity has been associated with several factors, such as patient age, organ dysfunction, pharmacodynamic considerations, concurrent use of medications with overlapping toxicity, and the patient's previous experience with opioids. Several global strategies have been proposed that may reduce the adverse effects sometimes associated with opioid therapy. Opioid rotation has been found by different clinicians to be effective in the management of opioid-induced sedation, cognitive failure, hallucinations, delirium, myoclonus, hyperalgesia, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and dry mouth. Sedation is a common adverse effect either when patients are started on opioid analgesics or after receiving a significant increase in dose.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence).

Terapi farmakologi seperti pemberian Antidepresan dan Antipsikotik atau disebut juga dengan neuroleptik untuk menurunkan frekuensi dan tingkat keparahan simtom-simtom psikotik pada penderita skizofrenia. Pengobatan dengan antipsikotik sering menimbulkan efek samping seperti mulut kering (xerostomia). Xerostomia sekunder untuk hiposalivasi juga dapat mengakibatkan karies gigi rampan, infeksi jamur mulut seperti kandidiasis, perubahan rasa, mulut berbau, atau mulut terbakar. Karies gigi merupakan penyebab utama kehilangan gigi di kalangan kelompok muda. Hilangnya satu atau beberapa gigi dapat menyebabkan gangguan fungsi pengunyahan, bicara dan estetika yang dapat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup seseorang. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui hubungan gangguan psikotik skizofrenia paranoid terhadap kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien di Rumah Sakit Jiwa Banda Aceh. Pengambilan sampel dilakukan dengan cara Non-Probability Sampling dengan metode Purposive Sampling yang didapat sebanyak 24 orang subjek. Data yang diperoleh dari penelitian di analisis dengan Uji Chi-Square untuk melihat hubungan kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien skizofrenia paranoid dengan pengaruh lama konsumsi obat, jenis kelamin dan obat yang dikonsumsi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan pada variabel jenis kelamin tidak memberikan hasil yang signifikan karena nilai p = 1.000. Namun pada variabel lamanya perawatan menunjukkan hasil yang signifikan karena p = 0.041 dan juga pada variabel obat yang dikonsumsi menunjukkan hasil signifikan dengan nilai p = 0.027. Hasil peneltian menunjukkan adanya Hubungan Gangguan Psikotik Skizofrenia Paranoid terhadap Kehilangan Gigi Sebagian pada Pasien di Rumah Sakit Jiwa Banda Aceh secara signifikan terhadap lama konsumsi obat dan jenis obat yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien, namun tidak adanya hubungan signifikan terhadap jenis kelamin.\r Kata Kunci : Skizofrenia Paranoid, Obat Antidepresan, Obat Antipsikotik, Xerostomia, Karies Gigi, Kehilangan Gigi Sebagian.\r ABSTRACT\r Name\t\t\t : Cut Novera Riskina\r Study Programme\t : Dentistry\r Faculty : Dentistry\r Title\t: Relationship of Paranoid Schizophrenia Psychotic ..Disorders to Partial Tooth Loss in Patients in Mental ..Hospital\r Schizophrenia is a complex chronic mental health disorder characterized by a series of symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, speech or irregular behavior, and impaired cognitive abilities. Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

According to recent publications the use and abuse of alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, marihuana, and drugs such as sedatives (neuroleptics), caffeine, minor tranquilisers and other may provoke acute and chronic anxiety and depression. When confronted with anxiety states or depressive states, it is absolutely essential not to overlook the possibility that they may have been induced by a medicament or a drug which the patient has been using.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "abstract": "Taking opiates for medical purposes without supervision of healthcare professionals and non-medical purposes can cause different consequences such as delirium or even injury, and may cause addiction over a longer period of time. The most common recreational opium is heroin, while opium is rarely used. Opiate groups include opium, morphine, heroin, methadone and codeine. Addiction is manifested through physical and psychological dependence. Physical or biological dependence refers to the change in the biological state of the organism, while psychic addiction implies the forced necessity of entering the substance into the organism in order to restore good mood and to avoid the suffering of certain substances. Addiction leads to acute intoxication characterized by euphoria, facial redness, pruritus, impaired breathing depth, hypotension and bradycardia. Apart from the symptoms of acute intoxication, the use of opiates can lead to serious and even lethal consequences such as neurological diseases, hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Treatment of opiate dependence implies treatment with naloxone and clinical treatment. Very important for the treatment of overexpression is to determine tolerance to opiates to determine the required dose of the drug. In the Republic of Croatia, the legal framework for the fight against drug abuse is based on the Criminal Code and the Law on Combating Drug Abuse, while at the European Union level the National Strategy for the Suppression of Drug Abuse in the Republic of Croatia was adopted. This research was carried out in order to determine the existence of differences in urban and rural addicts with regard to social demographic characteristics.Research has shown that addicts in urban areas are equally to addicts in rural areas by the time of arrival to the drogs band that addicts in urban and rural areas relatively early start with addiction treatment. The study included 57 respondents divided by sex and area of residence. From the data on opiate abuse by observing the most addicted counties, it is represented in Zagreb and Zagreb County, followed by Istrian and Krapina-Zagorje County. Heptane is the most widely used main source consumed in the city of Zagreb.",

The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

Epilepsy is defined as at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart or one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years [5]. The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal. Percebe-se que o fonoaudiólogo pode contribuir para amenizar os sintomas encontrados nestas patologias, proporcionando uma qualidade de vida melhor aos seus portadores.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

Although certain epilepsy syndromes, such as infantile spasms, are associated with mental retardation or progressive intellectual decline, others typically are associated with normal development.

Drugs, especially those related to neurotransmitters may induce complicated symptoms in the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. Some of these symptoms are accompanied by peripheral neuropathy. Intoxication, especially alcoholism is often are combined with a malnutrition, such as avitaminosis. Dysautonomic symptoms change successively; at an early stage, drugs or toxins stimulate sympathetic or parasympathetic receptors, while the same receptors are inhibited at a later stage when the concentration of the substances rises in the blood. Frequent stimulations of the same receptor may produce change in the sensitivity of receptors, decreased metabolism or addiction. These changes suggest that a different approach towards the acute and chronic autonomic disorders caused by intoxications is needed.",

      "abstract": "1. Puberty and adolescence mainly can have a bad effect on idiopathic generalized epilepsies. This can show up in the first onset of seizures in adolescence, e.g. as a form of idiopathic grand mal on awakening, juvenile absence epilepsy or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (impulsive petit mal). Also, already diagnosed absence epilepsy can become worse, e.g. by recurring absence seizures or grand mal seizures or the new onset of grand mal on awakening. 2. Exogenous factors, like changing the time of sleeping and waking, lack of sleep and the abuse of alcohol, play an important role in these types of epilepsy. Cutting out these factors is just as important as the consequent drug treatment on a longterm basis. 3. Drug treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy will be done with valproate, barbiturates and ethosuximide. Regarding fatal complications of liver function, which are more frequent than previously thought of, valproate can be recommended as a drug of first choice, especially in early childhood and when a combination of drugs is used. 4. A very good effect of adolescence is seen in children with benign idiopathic focal epilepsy with a centro-temporal spike focus. Antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine as an agent of first choice can be done less vigorously. 5. Menstruation usually only modifies but does not worsen the natural course of epilepsy. There is still no real therapeutical plan for this rare form of epilepsy. 6. It cannot be a general rule, not to change current medical treatment before or during puberty in order to avoid any worsening of seizures. A decision always has to be made regarding the form of epilepsy and the individual situation, which has to be discussed with the patient and perhaps his family.",

Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death.

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Los sintomas son mas graves cuando la enfermedad es farmaco-resistente, de origen temprano, con larga duracion y con gran numero de crisis. Caso clinico. Paciente de 23 anos con crisis muy frecuentes y dos episodios de estatus epileptico farmacorresistentes. En las neuroimagenes se detecto un astrocitoma en hipocampo izquierdo, atrofia cerebelosa e hipoperfusion bilateral con predominio izquierdo. Presentaba psicosis con delirios y alucinaciones religiosas, personalidad del lobulo temporal, irritabilidad y graves alteraciones cognitivas. Tras lobectomia temporal y amigdalo-hipocampectomia disminuyeron las crisis y mejoraron levemente las funciones cognitivas, empeorando la psicosis y la agresividad. Conclusiones. La ELT muestra relacion con la psicosis y puede producir retraso mental. Se discute la posibilidad de una normalizacion forzada tras la lobectomia que disminuye la independencia y autonomia personal del paciente.",

Individuals experiencing this disorder encounter challenges in moderating or stopping their opioid usage, even when faced with problems resulting from the drug. This disorder may involve both physical and psychological dependencies. Psychological dependence occurs when a drug becomes so integral to an individual's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that the urge to continue using it becomes a strong craving or compulsion, persisting despite adverse consequences.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Much progress has taken place in knowledge of actions and use of opioids in pain in the last quarter century. There would be much less unnecessary pain and suffering if this knowledge would be applied properly in clinical practice. Why is it not? The major reasons appear to be ignorance, false prejudices (myths) and exaggerated limitations in availability of opioids for medical treatment of pain. Even the strongest opioid analgesics do not need to relieve pain in everybody. Their effect should be monitored and if inadequate, proper measures should be taken (e.g. adjusting a dose or changing an opioid). Weak opioids (codeine, tramadol) alone are mostly not stronger then non-opioid analgesics. However, combinations of opioid analgesics with paracetamol often show synergistic analgesic effect (without increased toxicity). Opioids actually represent very safe analgesics. Exaggerated opiophobia is a major myth causing much unnecessary pain and suffering in patients. Undue fear of drug abuse and/or political considerations have resulted in laws and regulations, that make it unnecessarily difficult to obtain opioids for medical use. An example of this might be a recent re-scheduling of buprenorphine in the Czech Republic and Slovakia among drugs with a very high abuse potential (e.g. morphine, fentanyl, amphetamine).",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Opioids have been used for millennia for analgesic and pleasurable effects. Over 7 million Americans have an opioid use disorder (OUD). Illicitly manufactured fentanyl and analogues are the most common opioids implicated in overdose deaths. Acute effects include analgesia, respiratory depression, miosis, and euphoria. Overdose is a serious complication of opioid use, characterized by depressed level of consciousness and respiratory depression. It can be treated with naloxone. Withdrawal symptoms include dysphoria, yawning, tearing, diarrhea, cramps, nausea, and piloerection. Opioids can be detected with urine drug tests; however, some synthetic opioids (such as fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine) are not detected by tests for opiates (opioids derived from poppy such as heroin and morphine). Constipation is the most common complication. Long-term complications from chronic use may include central sleep apnea, hypogonadism, adrenal insufficiency, and lower bone mineral density. Many of the medical complications associated with illicit opioid use are due to use of needles. Buprenorphine, methadone, clonidine, lofexidine, or other opioids can be used to ameliorate the symptoms of withdrawal, but supervised withdrawal alone is not an effective treatment for OUD. Pharmacotherapy with an opioid agonist (methadone or buprenorphine) is the most effective treatment. Long-acting injectable naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is also effective but is harder to initiate. There are a number of psychosocial treatments, including self-help groups, outpatient therapy, and residential treatment; data on their effectiveness are limited.",

      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration.

Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment.

The physician treating patients with a new onset or exacerbation of seizures around a major life event must consider all of these factors in the evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (AIPD) is a rare complication of alcohol abuse which is characterized by an acute onset of auditory or visual hallucinations that occur either during or after a period of heavy alcohol consumption. Other symptoms include delusions, thought disorder, psychomotor disturbances, and abnormal affect. To establish the diagnosis, one must rule out other disorders such as alcohol withdrawal delirium or other psychotic disorders. Although it is well recognised, relatively little is known about the condition. Moreover, the pathogenesis and treatment of AIPD are still unclear despite high co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders, high re-hospitalization as well as mortality rates and suicidal behaviour. Therefore, the prognosis appears less favourable. We present a case of young man with AIPD with suicidal attempt secondary to auditory hallucination.

      "abstract": "The Neurobiology of Opioid Dependence: Implications for Treatment W W hile the individual patient, rather than his or her disease, is the appro- priate focus of treatment for opioid abuse, an understanding of the neurobiology of dependence and addiction can be invaluable to the clinician.It can provide insight about patient behaviors and problems, help define realistic expectations, and clarify the rationales for treatment methods and goals.As well, patients who are informed about the brain origins of addiction can benefit from understanding that their illness has a biological basis and does not mean they are \"bad\" people.Brain abnormalities resulting from chronic use of heroin, oxycodone, and other morphine-derived drugs are underlying causes of opioid dependence (the need to keep taking drugs to avoid a withdrawal syndrome) and addiction (intense drug craving and compulsive use).The abnormalities that produce dependence, well understood by science, appear to resolve after detoxification, within days or weeks after opioid use stops.The abnormalities that produce addiction, however, are more wide-ranging, complex, and long-lasting.They may involve an interaction of environmental effects-for example, stress, the social context of initial opiate use, and psychological conditioning-and a genetic predisposition in the form of brain pathways that were abnormal even before the first dose of opioid was taken.Such abnormalities can produce craving that leads to relapse months or years after the individual is no longer opioid dependent.In this article we describe how opioids affect brain processes to produce drug liking, tolerance, dependence, and addiction.While these processes, like everything else that happens in the brain, are highly complex, we try to explain them in terms that can be easily understood and explained to patients.We also discuss Opioid tolerance, dependence, and addiction are all manifestations of brain changes resulting from chronic opioid abuse.The opioid abuser's struggle for recovery is in great part a struggle to overcome the effects of these changes.Medications such as methadone, LAAM, buprenorphine, and naltrexone act on the same brain structures and processes as addictive opioids, but with protective or normalizing effects.Despite the effectiveness of medications, they must be used in conjunction with appropriate psychosocial treatments.",

      "title": "New Clinical Implications of Opiate Maintenance Treatments",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor\r\n\r\nOpiate addiction is a chronic mental illness with severe repercussion in personal and public health. Various medicaments have been subjected to research in order to find a proper treatment, methadone is the most and wide used drug, buprenorphine/naloxone is the most recent ones, but other choices have been proposed such as prescribing heroin (1). The mentioned treatments, are considered as maintenance ones, because, the chronic illnesses need a longtime approach. Other possibilities have been studied, for example the detoxification (conventional or ultra-rapid) as well as the use of opiate antagonist as naltrexone. On the other hand, a long period of dis habituation or relapse prevention is required after detoxification of all sorts of addictions, including opiate dependency.\r\n\r\nOn this second phase, psychological therapies are very important, as well as social and family support. Most patients need during dis habituation (of heroin addiction) a preliminary period of opiate maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (2).\r\n\r\nSide effects, as well as notwell-known effects, of drug and treatments are a very interesting goal of research. The hypogonadotrophic effect of opioids can be observed even after the administration of a single opioid dose, both in laboratory animals and in humans (3). Other studies have reported that methadone and buprenorphine are opioids with effects on spermatogenesis (4) and secondary sex organs. It seems probable that these drugs could affect testes volume.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, those effects have quantitative differences depending on the opiate as showed in the paper titled “A quantitative and qualitative study of rat testis following administration of methadone and buprenorphine” (5).\r\n\r\nHeidari et al. observed Buprenorphine treatment is more appropriate for treating opiate addiction in male rats since it does not affect normal testicular structure and function (5). Those results should be considered by all the professionals involved in addictions and their co-morbidities (dual pathology) research projects and treatment, not only because of the consequences of this side effect on sexuality or reproduction, but also how the testosterone deficiency is related to the not well-known effects of opioid maintenance treatments, as its antipsychotic properties or its influence on personality dimensions as reward dependence on opiate dependents type II or antisocial (6).",

      "title": "The patient burden of opioidinduced bowel dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Orally formulated opioids are commonly prescribed analgesics to treat severe pain. Among severe adverse effects are respiratory depression, sedation and opioid-addiction; less dangerous, however still burdensome for the many treated patients, are symptoms such as nausea, cognitive impairment and bowel dysfunction. It has e.g. been shown that the patient experienced burdens of opioid induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) and opioid induced constipation (OIC) negatively impact the quality of life of these patients. Consequently, patients often take less medication than prescribed to dampen these adverse effects. This review focuses a thorough description of the underlying mechanistic causes of OIBD, originating from binding of exogenous opioids to the peripheral opioid receptors in the enteric nervous system of the gut. Consequently, the bowel becomes dysfunctional function changes caused by alterations in i) motility, ii) secretion and absorption and iii)sphincter functions. Such alterations lead to a variety of symptoms including gastro-esophageal reflux, abdominal pain, prolongation of transit times and dry hardened stool. Thus, the experienced psychological burden of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is a net-result of its physical occurrence as well as its negative impact on health-related quality of life. Unfortunately, gastrointestinal dysfunction is considered a taboo and people may refrain to describe and discuss the experienced burdens. This review targets health care professionals, who to a higher degree are encouraged to discuss openly if presence of OIBD/OIC impacts the daily life and social activities of the patients. Finally, different mechanistic treatment approaches are reviewed in order to provide clinicians with different pharmacological options and strategies, which include traditional laxatives, prokinetics and co-administration of opioid antagonists. Even though the opioid-antagonists have proved to be superior to placebo in the relief of OIBD/OIC, further clinical studies are needed in order to optimize treatments for the benefit of future patients.",

Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

      "title": "Treatment of opioid use disorder in patients with liver disease",
      "abstract": "Key Points What is the impact of opioid use disorder (OUD) among patients with chronic liver disease? How is OUD diagnosed, and what evidence-based treatment options exist—in general, and among those with chronic liver disease? What are the implications of opioid use and opioid use disorder with regard to liver transplantation (eligibility for transplantation, outcomes after transplantation, perioperative management of pain in the setting of opioid agonist treatment or chronic opioid exposure)? INTRODUCTION OUD is a chronic, relapsing, and treatable condition characterized by continued opioid use despite negative consequences. Approximately 2.7 million people in the United States are affected by OUD.1 The disorder has genetic, neurobiological, social, and environmental contributors. OUD is associated with structural brain changes involved in the reward system and memory formation.2 Left untreated, OUD can lead to serious mental, physical, and social complications. Due to its chronic nature, long-term treatment is typically required. Although the incidence of prescribed opioid misuse has decreased, nonprescribed opioid misuse and overdose mortality are climbing, driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and concurrent stimulant use. More than 80,000 Americans died of opioid-involved overdoses in 2021, an increase of 61% compared to 2 years prior.3 Black, Hispanic, and American Indian communities are disproportionately affected by OUD harms and overdose deaths and are less likely to receive treatment.4 OUD is associated with conditions that cause liver disease, including alcohol use disorder and viral hepatitis. Understanding the diagnosis, treatment, and complications of OUD is essential for all health care professionals caring for individuals with liver disease. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OUD is diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition criteria.5 People who use opioids and demonstrate at least 2 signs or symptoms from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition criteria are diagnosed with OUD with severity graded by the number of symptoms (Box 1).BOX 1 - DSM-5 Criteria for OUD 1. Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid use. 3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the opioid, use the opioid, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving or a strong desire or urge to use opioids. 5. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of opioids. 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of opioid use. 8. Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: (a) A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or desired effect; or (b) A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an opioid 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: (a) The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome; or (b) Opioids are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms Mild: 2–3 symptoms present Moderate: 4–5 symptoms present Severe: 6 or more symptoms present Abbreviation: DSM-5, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition; OUD, opioid use disorder. Evidence-based OUD treatment is highly effective, and long-term pharmacotherapy is the standard of care. The 3 FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are methadone (full opioid agonist), buprenorphine (partial opioid agonist), and naltrexone (full opioid antagonist). Methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality, with the 2 opioid agonist treatments (ie, methadone and buprenorphine) having the strongest evidence. The best medication for an individual depends on their medical co-morbidities, prior treatment response, pharmacologic factors, and social needs. Table 1 provides a comparison of the 3 MOUD options to help guide clinical decision-making. TABLE 1 - Key clinical considerations guiding the choice of medication for opioid use disorder Methadone Buprenorphine Naltrexone Mechanism of action Full mu-opioid receptor agonist Partial mu-opioid receptor agonist Full mu-opioid receptor antagonist Mortality benefit Yes, strong evidence Yes, strong evidence Unknown; weak evidence Need for withdrawal before initiation No Possible; can reduce withdrawal with certain initiation strategies Yes; abstain from all opioids for 4–7 d before initiation Formulation Oral Sublingual; monthly or weekly XR subcutaneous injection Monthly XR IM injection; oral Location and administration Only dispensed in a licensed OTP; requires daily observed dosing, with \"take-home\" doses allowed based on patient stability. Prescribed outpatient by DEA-registered practitioners. XR injection administered by a qualified clinician. XR injection administered by a qualified clinician. Risk of respiratory depression Higher than buprenorphine. Increased risk during initiation, in combination with sedating substances, or with decreased hepatic clearance. Lower than full opioid agonists (eg, methadone) None Considerations in severe hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh Class C) Decreased clearance requiring cautious initiation (eg, half of the standard starting dose) and close monitoring. Decreased clearance requiring cautious initiation, but lower overdose risk than methadone. Consider using buprenorphine-only formulation (rather than buprenorphine/naloxone). Not indicated Abbreviations: DEA, Drug Enforcement Administration; IM, intramuscular; OTP, opioid treatment program; XR-naltrexone, extended-release naltrexone. Methadone Methadone is a full mu-opioid receptor agonist that suppresses opioid withdrawal and cravings and blocks opioid-related euphoria. It has a slow onset of action, taking ~120 hours to reach a steady state, and a long, variable elimination half-life. Methadone treatment is associated with sustained recovery time, improved social functioning, decreased risk of HIV and hepatitis C, and lower mortality.6 In the United States, methadone for OUD can only be accessed through government-licensed opioid treatment programs, where patients present for daily observed dosing. Those who demonstrate prolonged stability can access \"take-home\" doses that reduce the frequency of required visits. Methadone is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Genetic variations in liver metabolism and CYP-mediated drug interactions influence the plasma concentration. Methadone can prolong the QT interval and cause arrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes) in patients taking higher doses or other QT-prolonging drugs and in those with congenital long QT syndrome. Methadone clearance is substantially reduced in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (ie, Child-Pugh Class C) and should be initiated cautiously, starting with low doses (eg, half of the standard dose). For example, for a hospitalized patient with OUD and severe hepatic dysfunction in acute opioid withdrawal, initiating methadone 10 mg (compared to 20 mg for patients without hepatic dysfunction) may be appropriate. Repeated doses should be given until withdrawal symptoms abate up to a maximum dose of 40 mg/day with monitoring for sedation. Buprenorphine Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist that suppresses opioid withdrawal and cravings and blocks the opioid-induced euphoria. Buprenorphine's mu-opioid receptor activation plateaus with increasing doses, resulting in a \"ceiling effect\" on respiratory and central nervous system depression; thus, it carries a significantly lower overdose risk than full opioid agonists. Buprenorphine improves recovery rates and psychosocial outcomes and is at least as effective as methadone in reducing mortality.7 Buprenorphine is available in sublingual formulation, alone or in combination with the opioid antagonist naloxone, and in 2 extended-release subcutaneous injections administered weekly or monthly by a medical professional. All practitioners registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration can prescribe buprenorphine for OUD in general health settings, making it more accessible than methadone. For patients with physical opioid dependence, buprenorphine must be initiated by an induction method to avoid precipitated withdrawal.8 Like methadone, buprenorphine is metabolized primarily by the CYP system. Observational data demonstrates rare transaminase elevations and no cases of DILI with buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine can be safely used in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction with cautious initiation and titration. Hepatic impairment reduces naloxone clearance, so sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction can cause withdrawal; thus, the buprenorphine-only formulation may be preferred.9 Naltrexone Naltrexone is a full mu-opioid receptor antagonist available as a daily oral tablet and a monthly extended-release intramuscular injection administered by a medical professional. I.M. naltrexone reduces opioid cravings, improves abstinence rates, and has a possible mortality benefit.10 Evidence on the efficacy of oral naltrexone is mixed with some studies showing no benefit over placebo.11 Naltrexone is also FDA-approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Individuals must abstain from opioids for at least 4–7 days before starting naltrexone to avoid precipitated withdrawal. This is a major barrier to starting naltrexone compared to methadone and buprenorphine and contributes to lower initiation rates. Because naltrexone reduces opioid tolerance, individuals who return to opioid use are at higher risk of fatal overdose. Naltrexone is associated with variable liver enzyme elevations with very rare cases of liver injury. Naltrexone has demonstrated safety for use in alcohol-associated compensated cirrhosis; however, evidence in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction is limited, and naltrexone should only be used with caution in patients recovering from acute hepatitis. Social, psychological, and behavioral treatments Counseling, recovery coaching, and interventions to improve social determinants of health are important parts of OUD treatment. Harm reduction measures save lives and reduce stigma. Syringe service programs and overdose prevention centers (ie, safer consumption sites) reduce transmission of viral hepatitis and HIV, prevent overdose, and connect patients to OUD treatment. All individuals who use opioids should be given intranasal naloxone and counseling on overdose prevention. LIVER TRANSPLANTATION CONSIDERATIONS Patients with OUD may be referred for liver transplantation, given the high prevalence of co-morbid OUD and liver disease. Guidelines on liver transplantation evaluation recommend a psychiatric consultation to assess for mental health and substance use disorders.12 There is no specific recommended abstinence requirement for patients with OUD being considered for liver transplantation. In comparison, at least 6 months of abstinence from alcohol use is commonly required for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease.12 The guidelines reinforce that patients \"should not be denied transplantation based on methadone use alone, and expectations of methadone reduction or discontinuation should not be a requirement for transplant listing (1-B).\"12 There is significant variability across liver transplant centers with respect to the eligibility of patients taking MOUD. In a 2017 survey of liver transplant centers, only 1 program considered methadone or buprenorphine treatment an absolute contraindication to transplant, while 38% considered it a relative contraindication.13 One-third of centers required doses of methadone or buprenorphine below a certain threshold, which conflicts with OUD treatment standards of practice that recommend individualized dosing to improve quality of life and reduce opioid-related harm. Published evidence on transplantation outcomes among patients on MOUD is promising, with most data coming from retrospective studies of patients on methadone. In the largest retrospective study, 36 liver transplant recipients receiving methadone had similar patient and graft survival rates to the national average, with only 4 documented single-time episodes of posttransplant injection drug use.14 Data on buprenorphine and transplant outcomes is more limited. There are 2 case reports of patients taking buprenorphine-naloxone who received liver transplants, both of whom maintained good graft function and abstinence from nonprescribed opioids within 18 months of transplant.15 Programs evaluating patients with OUD for liver transplantation should take an individualized approach and prioritize evidence-based treatment. Policies that require tapering or discontinuing MOUD put patients at risk of returning to nonprescribed opioid use, reducing their odds of ever receiving a transplant. Involving an addiction medicine specialist can help optimize treatment and establish longitudinal care to support the patient's recovery posttransplant. MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE AND PERIOPERATIVE PAIN IN PATIENTS WITH OUD AND LIVER DISEASE Treating acute pain in patients with OUD can be challenging due to the complex and interrelated nature of pain and OUD. MOUD adds complexity because of their unique pharmacologic profiles and potential interactions with opioid analgesics. While methadone and buprenorphine may interfere with analgesic efficacy, current guidelines recommend continuing these medications during the perioperative period.16 Higher doses and shorter dosing intervals of opioid analgesics may be required due to increased pain sensitivity and cross-tolerance. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioid analgesics. Therefore, oral naltrexone should be stopped 72 hours before and IM naltrexone 30 days before scheduled surgery. CONCLUSION OUD is prevalent and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Long-term, evidence-based treatment with medications and psychosocial treatments are highly effective and decrease mortality. It is crucial to continue OUD treatment, including medications, during the perioperative period.",

      "abstract": "After prolonged opioid exposure, children develop opioid-induced hyperalgesia, tolerance, and withdrawal. Strategies for prevention and management should be based on the mechanisms of opioid tolerance and withdrawal.Relevant manuscripts published in the English language were searched in Medline by using search terms \"opioid,\" \"opiate,\" \"sedation,\" \"analgesia,\" \"child,\" \"infant-newborn,\" \"tolerance,\" \"dependency,\" \"withdrawal,\" \"analgesic,\" \"receptor,\" and \"individual opioid drugs.\" Clinical and preclinical studies were reviewed for data synthesis.Mechanisms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance suggest important drug- and patient-related risk factors that lead to tolerance and withdrawal. Opioid tolerance occurs earlier in the younger age groups, develops commonly during critical illness, and results more frequently from prolonged intravenous infusions of short-acting opioids. Treatment options include slowly tapering opioid doses, switching to longer-acting opioids, or specifically treating the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Novel therapies may also include blocking the mechanisms of opioid tolerance, which would enhance the safety and effectiveness of opioid analgesia.Opioid tolerance and withdrawal occur frequently in critically ill children. Novel insights into opioid receptor physiology and cellular biochemical changes will inform scientific approaches for the use of opioid analgesia and the prevention of opioid tolerance and withdrawal.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

Neuroanatomical findings on imaginga. Most consistent finding is ventricular enlargement, especially third and lateral ventriclesb. Selective reduction in size of frontal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus, and limbic regions, including the hippocampus and medial temporal lobec.

Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies implicatefrontal cortex (orbital, dorsolateral, medial), anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, several temporal lobe subregions, and cerebellumc. PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11.

Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12.

      "abstract": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are medications that are frequently prescribed for gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, a few case reports have described neuropsychiatric symptoms following PPI use. In this report, we present a case of visual hallucinations secondary to PPI usage and propose possible mechanisms. In this case, a 65-year-old man with no psychiatric history developed acute visual hallucinations following initiation of omeprazole, in the absence of delusions, paranoia, and other psychotic symptoms. The visual hallucinations began after the patient started treatment with omeprazole and resolved almost immediately upon discontinuation of omeprazole. To treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, omeprazole was replaced with famotidine, and the visual hallucinations did not recur after the omeprazole had been discontinued. No other psychotic signs or symptoms were present in this patient throughout the duration of his hospitalization. Although the scientific literature provides limited information on psychosis related to PPI use, a growing number of case reports and studies in recent years have suggested that neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur after PPI use. It is our hope that this case report adds to the scientific and medical knowledge in this area.",

Also challenging for clinicians are consensus definitions for opioid pharmacology which are poorly chosen, changing, or euphemistic. This paper collects opioid consensus definitions for addiction, physical dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal, and offers practical discussion of the concepts they address. Addiction is a short-circuiting or overdrive of the mesocorticolimbic system of the brain. Physical dependence on opioids means that after chronic opioid dosing an abrupt cessation or marked dose decrease causes an opioid withdrawal syndrome. Physical dependence and addiction are unrelated neuroplastic phenomena which occur in different parts of the brain. Tolerance means a decreasing drug effect for a given dose over time. This applies to desired drug effects and to drug side-effects.",

In addition, the epilepsy itself may cause changes in the nervous system through the metabolic and excitotoxic effects of the seizures and the neurotransmitter elements involved at the membrane level. The effect of the treatment modality, be it pharmacologic or surgical, may also play havoc with cognitive function. The neurobehavioral effects of antiepileptic drugs, although probably less important with the newer agents than in the past, must be considered, especially in polypharmacy, as recent reports have indicated. With increasing data, the effects of various surgical procedures on the cognitive elements of human behavior are becoming better recognized.",

Se presenta frecuentemente asociado a pacientes con diagnósticos de patologías orgánicas que son causa de dolor crónico. Estos pacientes frecuentemente presentan una escalada de tratamiento analgésico con inicio de tratamientos con opioides por refractariedad a los tratamientos previos. Algunos de estos pacientes desarrollan un Trastorno por Uso de Opioides, con características como fenómenos de tolerancia, dependencia y abstinencia similares a las adicciones a otras sustancias. En ocasiones, a pesar del aumento de dosis no se consiga un alivio del dolor, secundario a otros fenómenos de hiperalgesia y sensibilización central. Existe entonces un predominio de las conductas asociadas a la adicción. Se han identificado diferentes factores tanto personales como del entorno relacionados con el desarrollo del Trastorno por Uso de Opioides en pacientes con tratamiento con opioides y dolor crónico. Entre estos factores también se encuentra la comorbilidad psiquiátrica con trastorno mental grave y trastorno por uso de múltiples sustancias.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

It is usual to associate a benzodiazepin with an opioid, more often Midazolam and Morphine or Fentanyl; other drugs as Propofol, Clonidine and Ketamine have specific indications, brief painful procedures and weaning from long periods of sedation to avoid withdrawal. Sometimes it can be useful to add a neuromuscular blocking agent to help mechanical ventilation. Adverse sedation events are relatively frequent, associated with drug overdoses and drug interactions, particularly when 3 or more drugs are used: all class of medications and all routes of administration are involved.",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "abstract": "El insomnio es altamente prevalente en la poblacion, y mas en los adultos mayores. Cerca de 50% de la poblacion lo padece, y es un problema que se asocia con una serie de alteraciones: disminucion de la capacidad fisica, problemas de concentracion y atencion, multiples patologias se exacerban, lo que acaba produciendo una disminucion de la calidad de vida de la personas. Asi mismo se interrelaciona con multiples problemas tanto fisicos, como psicologicos y sociales que pueden agravar o ser causa a su vez de las alteraciones del sueno. Reconocer los problemas del sueno y clasificarlos adecuadamente permite determinar la necesidad o no de estudios complementarios, seleccionar el manejo mas adecuado en forma individual, recomendar el manejo no farmacologico (terapia cognitivo conductual, manejo del ambiente), y si fuera necesario, determinar el tipo de farmaco mas adecuado en funcion de la asociacion existente con otras patologias (enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cronica [EPOC], depresion, ansiedad, sindrome de piernas inquietas, etc.). La pequena revision que se presenta tiene como objetivo presentar al medico general las bases para enfrentarse al paciente adulto mayor que padece de alteraciones del sueno. Sin pasar por alto que existen cambios producidos por el envejecimiento que ya de por si modifican el ciclo sueno-vigilia, ademas de considerar los cambios psicosociales que se presentan",

      "title": "Delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism with leukoencephalopathy associated with carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation.

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe principal routes of cocaine administration are oral, intranasal, intravenous, and inhalation.The slang terms for these routes are, respectively, \"chewing,\" \"snorting,\" \"mainlining,\" \"injecting,\" and \"smoking\" (including freebase and crack cocaine).Cocaine use ranges from occasional use to repeated or compulsive use, with a variety of patterns between these extremes.There is no safe way to use cocaine.Any route of administration can lead to absorption of toxic amounts of cocaine, allowing to acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies that could result in sudden death.Repeated cocaine use by any route of administration can produce addiction and other adverse health consequences.Those who snort or sniff cocaine through their noses suffer damage to their nasal and sinus passages.These include nasal crusting, nosebleeds, nasal congestion, irritation, facial pain caused by sinusitis and hoarseness.Cocaine addiction changes the responsiveness of the brain to various neurotransmitters or chemicals.The development of drug addiction involves persistent cellular and molecular changes in the Central Nervious System.The brain dopamine, GABA and glutamate systems play key roles in mediating drug-induced neuroadaptation.We show some physiological changes that can occur in some key pathways in which glutamate, dopamine and GABA receptors are involved.These chemical changes cause different effects in users, including: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, psychosis, headaches and nausea.Cocaine use and addiction affects the sympathetic nervous system (which controls automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, etc.).This system secretes adrenaline which raises ones heart rate, narrows blood vessels and significantly increases blood pressure.Chest pain, heart attacks and strokes are common side effects of cocaine use.The most widely studied neurobiological characteristic of cocaine addiction is the role played by dopamine transmission.It is clear that enhanced dopamine transmission in neurons projecting from the ventral mesencephalon to the limbic forebrain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), is the pharmacological target for cocaine-induced reinforcement and locomotor stimulation (O'Brien., 2001) However, persistence of the behavioral characteristics of cocaine addiction, such as paranoia (sensitization) and the propensity to relapse years after the acute rewarding effects of the drug have disappeared, indicates that there must also be neuronal substrates undergoing Addictions -From Pathophysiology to Treatment 104 long-term neuroplastic changes.Although studies have endeavored to identify enduring changes in dopamine transmission that might underlie behavioral sensitization and the reinstatement of drug-seeking (relapse), the results have not been entirely consistent with an obligatory role for dopamine.Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity.One of the bestestablished molecular mechanisms of addiction is up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.This up-regulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence.In contrast, induction of another transcription factor, termed 1FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure.Knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.Cocaine Dopamine Tansporter (DAT) Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) Serotonine Transporter (SERT)",

      "abstract": "Normal conscious behaviour means awareness of self and the environment and depends on intact brain function.'Changes in the level of consciousness reflect an abnormal function of the brain.The degree, depth, and duration of altered consciousness may vary from drowsiness to brain death, and \"coma\" or un- consciousness is best defined as an inability to obey commands, utter recognisable words, or open the eyes.2Pathological conditions associated with this state are brain injury from trauma; cerebrovascular accidents; hypoxia; hypotension (low perfusion states); uncontrolled epilepsy; and disorders of metabolism, such as hepatic and renal failure and drug overdose.As well as managing the primary cause of the coma, energetic treatment is needed to prevent the complications of unconscious- ness, the most serious of which are hypoxia and hypotension.All unconscious patients run the risk of an obstructed airway from the tongue falling back into the oropharynx.The inability to cough or swallow leads to an accumulation of secretions in the mouth, pharynx, trachea, and bronchi.Vomit and regurgitated gastric contents may be inhaled giving rise to the acid-aspiration (Mendelson's) syndrome in the lungs.The already damaged brain cannot withstand any further insults that may occur from inadequate cerebral oxygenation and perfusion due to a low arterial Po2 or low blood pressure.3The unconscious patient may need total care for days, weeks, or months, the problems being those of maintaining vital functions (adequate ventilation, circulation, and nutrition) and general nursing care.Anaesthesia is a pharmacologically induced state of uncon- sciousness and the well-trained anaesthetists of today, with their skill in care of the airway, endotracheal intubation, intravenous cannulation, ventilator management, and knowledge of applied pharmacology and respiratory physiology, are particularly able to care for these patients.The skills and lessons learnt in the operating theatre have enabled them to take part in the development, organisation, and management of patients in immediate care schemes and intensive treatment units and to teach these skills to other doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and ambulance men.",

In the latter case, the symptoms may be genuine side effects of drugs (hypotension, pathologic gambling, etc.) or they may be secondary either to the pathoplastic effect they have on the natural course of the disease (nonmotor fluctuations) or to the lack of dopamine (apathy, depression, dopamine withdrawal syndrome, etc.). In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful. However, many other nonmotor (and motor) symptoms will have no correlation with dopamine; therefore, they require different treatments, very often with little efficacy, as in apathy or cognitive decline.",

The concomitant intravenous and intramuscular administration of the specific narcotic antagonist naloxone is warranted in such cases. Further threatening complications of opiate abuse include rhabdomyolysis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and both peripheral and central nervous lesions. Opiate abuse is often associated with benzodiazepine abuse. Hence, intravenous administration of the antagonist flumazenil is indicated in patients with suspected acute opiate intoxication resistant to naloxone. Cocaine abuse is not frequent in this country but is usually very severe and clinically heterogeneous. The clinical pattern of cocaine intoxication is initially due to excitatory and later to depressant effects on central nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems. The treatment of acute cocaine intoxication is symptomatic. The internal concealment of cocaine and other drugs in packets (body-packing) may lead to bowel obstruction or to acute intoxication following leaking or breaking of packets.",

Medication etiology should be particularly suspected when the symptoms begin with the initiation of a new medication and resolved with discontinuation of the same medication. Case Reports: Presented are two cases demonstrating that it is prudent to be aware of medications capable of inducing oculomotor dysfunction. Each case reveals instances of acute oculomotor dysfunction after the initiation of a central nervous system affecting medication. Case 1 details a partial pupil sparing third nerve palsy after initiating the anti-anxiety drug, buspirone. Case 2 accounts the addition of zolpidem (Ambien), a sedative, and the subsequent new onset nystagmus and hypertropia. Conclusion: In each case, no organic etiology was found, and the oculomotor dysfunction resolved following discontinuation of the recently added CNS affecting medication. Specific drug interactions are also considered as contributing factors to the oculomotor dysfunction in both cases.",

Häufig wird in den Lehrbüchern hier lapidar auf neurotoxische Schäden des Alkoholismus oder Mangelzustände verwiesen. In Teilbereichen ist die Forschung aber heute schon weiter. Im Vortrag wird ein kurzer Überblick über die wichtigsten neuropsychiatrischen Folgeschäden bei Alkoholismus gegeben und einige aktuelle Befunde zu Pathophysiologie und Therapie mitgeteilt. Eines der thematisierten Krankheitsbilder betrifft dabei die Alkoholhalluzinose, eine eher seltene Störung, bei denen der Alkoholkranke an akustischen Halluzinationen, gelegentlich auch paranoiden Symptomen oder Bewusstseins- und Orientierungsstörungen leidet. Trotz phänomenologischer Ähnlichkeit besteht offensichtlich keine genetische Verbindung zur Schizophrenie. Kasuistische Beobachtungen aus der Bildgebung haben gezeigt, dass bei Patienten mit Alkoholhalluzinose häufig eine Hypofunktion des Thalamus vorliegt, ähnlich wie bei schizophrenen Erkrankungen. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt des Vortrages wird das Wernicke-Korsakow-Syndrom sein, für das bislang keine ausreichenden Therapiemöglichkeiten bestehen.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundInfusion reactions may mimic drug hypersensitivity, with a spectrum of variability and heterogeneity for both individual and drug; symptoms may include anxiety, diaphoresis, rigors/chills, fever, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, headache, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing/bronchospasm, hypoxia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and death [1][2][3][4].Symptoms usually occur shortly after the infusion begins but can have delayed onset [1][2][3][4].Symptoms may decrease when the infusion rate is discontinued or slowed; at other times, the symptoms persist [1][2][3][4].To add to the complexity surrounding infusion reactions, multiple nomenclatures are used, including drugmediated hypersensitivity, infusion-related toxicity, cytokine storm, cytokine-release syndrome, anaphylactoid reaction, and serum sickness-like illness [2,[4][5][6][7][8].The spectrum of symptoms, variable onset, and the multiple names implicate the immune system.Recognizing the molecular and ontologic mayhem surrounding infusion reactions, we used software technology to investigate drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Advances in information technology allow data integration at many levels; molecular pathways can be visualized through dependency graphs and statistical modeling [9].MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) was developed by Molecular Health to connect biomolecules, pathways, targets and diseases in a drug-centric manner.Drugs highly associated with infusion reactions are reported by MASE using Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs).PRRs are calculated by the ratio of the observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs.The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) value is the PRR adjusted AbstractObjective: Infusion reactions can be serious life threatening adverse events and have been associated with many drugs and biologic agents.Our objective was to report drugs associated with infusion reactions using two different data-mining methodologies. Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

      "abstract": "Opioids are widely used drugs for treatment of pain and related disorders. Opiate addiction is a major public health concern in the United States causing significant increase in healthcare expenditure. They produce euphoria and sense of well-being which makes them addictive to some people. Used in higher doses they can lead to cardiac or respiratory compromise. They also impair cognition leading to impaired decision making. Opioids exert their effects by acting on three different types of receptors mu, delta, and kappa located on neuronal cell membranes causing inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Prolonged use of these drugs can lead to physical dependence causing withdrawal symptoms if a person stops using them. Commonly used medications to treat opiate addiction are methadone, LAAM (longer acting derivative of methadone), buprenorphine, and naltrexone.",

Most often, intermittent forms of alcohol abuse or dependence are observed in patients who present, between the acute ingestions of alcohol, a chronic consumption. Intermittent ingestions of alcohol can also be present among subjects presenting a pathological personality (antisocial personality) and a past or present dependence syndrome to heroine.

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

Epilepsy is a recurrent brain disorder of multiple etiologies and is characterized by recurrent seizures due to the excessive discharge of cerebral neurones.",

In addition, complications or other concomitant drugs influence their pharmacokinetics. Therefore, when we take medication for elderly patients, we need consideration different from young patients. Psychiatric symptoms which frequently occurred in elderly patients are dementia (including behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia), depressive state, sleep disturbance, and delirium. As warned by Food and Drug Administration, some studies reported that using antipsychotics for elderly patients with dementia increase their death rate.

After chronic opioid intake, the drug becomes less effective, so that higher doses are needed to produce the same effect as before —a phenomenon that is called tolerance. At the same time, a situation develops in which the interruption of taking the drugs results in withdrawal sickness, unmasking a state called dependence (1). Both tolerance and dependence result from biochemical changes in the brain.",

      "abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic brain disease which originates from long-term neuroadaptations that develop after repeated opioid consumption and withdrawal episodes. These neuroadaptations lead among other things to the development of a negative affect, which includes loss of motivation for natural rewards, higher anxiety, social deficits, heightened stress reactivity, an inability to identify and describe emotions, physical and/or emotional pain, malaise, dysphoria, sleep disorders and chronic irritability. The urge for relief from this negative affect is one of major causes of relapse, and thus represents a critical challenge for treatment and relapse prevention. Animal models of negative affect induced by opioid withdrawal have recapitulated the development of a negative emotional state with signs such as anhedonia, increased anxiety responses, increased despair-like behaviour and deficits in social interaction. This research has been critical to determine neurocircuitry adaptations during chronic opioid administration or upon withdrawal. In this review, we summarize the recent literature of rodent models of (i) acute withdrawal, (ii) protracted abstinence from passive administration of opioids, (iii) withdrawal or protracted abstinence from opioid self-administration. Finally, we describe neurocircuitry involved in acute withdrawal and protracted abstinence. This article is part of the Special Issue on \"Opioid-induced changes in addiction and pain circuits\".",

      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

      "title": "Late Onset Depression",
      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "Side effects play a significant role in the selection of drugs to be used in panic disorder/agoraphobia whose polyphobic symptomatology often includes a suspiciousness about taking drugs and a fear of undesired side effects which may lead to the refusal of treatment. The safety, side effects and patients' acceptance of alprazolam and imipramine versus placebo were evaluated in 1168 subjects with panic disorder/agoraphobia who had been enrolled in the second phase of the Upjohn World Wide Panic Study. Side effects that worsened over baseline to a greater extent with alprazolam than with imipramine and placebo were sedation, fatigue/weakness, memory problems, ataxia and slurred speech. In the imipramine group blurred vision, tachycardia/palpitations, insomnia, sleep disturbance, excitement/nervousness, malaise, dizziness/faintness, headache, nausea/vomiting and decrease in appetite were worse than in the other groups. In the placebo group the anxious symptoms were most prominent. The highest level of compliance was shown in the alprazolam-treated group and the lowest in the placebo-treated group. Strong predictors of side effects were not observed. If a side effect profile is known, it will be easier for a clinician to choose the right drug and the appropriate management by taking into account compliance, safety and efficacy in each patient under treatment. Further information about side effects in long-term maintenance treatment would be of great clinical pertinence in ensuring safety and enhancing patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN Los 2C (popularmente conocidos como tusi o cocaína rosa) son un grupo de sustancias pertenecientes a las fenetilaminas con efecto psicoestimulante y alucinógeno. Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

      "abstract": "Many patients experience difficulty swallowing pills, for I various reasons: * discomfort (particularly pediatric and geriatric patients) * postsurgical need for an alternate route of enteral intake (nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, jejunostomy) * dysphagia due to a neurologic disorder (multiple sclerosis, impaired gag reflex, dementing processes) * odynophagia (pain upon swallowing) due to gastroesophageal reflux or a structural abnormality * a structural abnormality of the head or neck that impairs swallowing. (1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations. Helping patients find a medication formulation that suits their needs strengthens adherence and the therapeutic relationship.

      "abstract": "Objective: To describe the concept of memory impairment in schizophrenia and the clinical implications of this concept in terms of patient assessment and neuroleptic drug use. Method: Narrative literature review. Results: Individuals suffering from schizophrenia normally exhibit some degree of memory impairment. Recent work in psychopathology indicates that the impairment is comprehensive, involving the sensory, short-term, and long-term memory stores. Memory impairment appears to be a primary symptom of the disease, and its underlying causes are likely organic. A number of medications, however (for example, traditional neuroleptics and drugs that have pronounced anticholinergic activity), may cause or exacerbate impairment. In particular, anticholinergic agents used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms, a common complication of neuroleptic drugs, appear to have a deleterious effect on memory. Conclusions: Memory impairment is an important consideration in the clinical assessment and management of patients with schizophrenia. The use of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone appears to have no impact on memory function; because risperidone is associated with a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, it can obviate the need for anticholinergic medications—thus offering greater hope of nondebilitative intervention. The advent of medications that are safer (on cognition) could also lead to generally better outcomes by facilitating compliance with drug regimens and rehabilitation programs.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the regional administration of opioids is to provide an efficient and prolonged analgesia. Then, opiates can be useful for postoperative analgesia and for the treatment of chronic pain of malignant origin. Analgesia is correlated with several adverse effects of which the most frequent are nausea and itching and the most severe is respiratory depression. Beside the adverse effects, other properties of opiates could be responsible of favourable effects which can be taken in advantage in specific indications. In the postoperative period, epidurally administered opioid can attenuate the neuroendocrine and metabolic responses to surgery and pain. This effect is responsible of a reduction of the resistance to insulin and of a better nutritional balance, especially after major abdominal surgical procedures. Opioids also act by a reduction of the motor functions of the bowel, which perhaps could reduce the incidence of anastomotic breakdowns. Finally, other effects have been reported, as anecdotes, such as the treatment of spasm after bilateral replantation of the ureters, neurologic bladder dysfunctions and enuresis. Spinal administration of opioids has also been used as a treatment of premature ejaculation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Withdrawal-emergent adverse effects of antipsychotics are an infrequently identified condition which can appear during antipsychotic dose reduction and medication change. In this paper, we present the case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms after a dose reduction of risperidone is presented. A patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to a health care facility due to an unexpected change in his behavior, with paranoid delusions, incoherent thinking, and significant anxiety. An initial risperidone treatment was soon changed to zuclopenhixol. Subsequently, severe extrapyramidal symptoms appeared, after which the medication was switched back to resperidone. Following this treatment, the patient left the health care facility and stopped the medication of his own volition. Psychotic symptoms and massive extrapyramidal symptoms again occurred. These symptoms subsided only slowly during a subsequent treatment with olanzapine. The development of adverse neurological effects together with a worsening of productive psychotic symptomatology may be explained by withdrawal of antipsychotic medication. These symptoms are often attributed to new medications, which are prematurely discontinued after the appearance of an adverse effect, but which are potentially beneficial to a patient, provided that enough time for a spontaneous subsidence of withdrawal-emergent effects is given. Any change in antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered and thoroughly planned.",

Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.",

      "title": "Sucht und Demenz",
      "abstract": "Regelmäßiger Konsum führt bei vielen Drogen zu leichten kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen, die unter Abstinenz noch einige Zeit fortbestehen können, aber zum großen Teil reversibel sind. Zum neuropsychologischen Vollbild einer Demenz wie auch zu bleibenden strukturellen Hirnschädigungen kommt es hingegen nur selten. Die größten Risiken dauerhafter struktureller Hirnschäden bergen Kokain, Amphetamine und Ecstasy, geringer ist die Gefahr bei Benzodiazepinen, Cannabis und Opiaten. Selbst beim Alkohol ist unklar, inwieweit die reine Alkoholwirkung zu irreversiblen Hirnschäden führt. Dies ist offenbar nur bei dauerhaften sehr hohen Blut-Alkohol-Konzentrationen der Fall, wahrscheinlich wirken häufig Entzugsyndrome verschlimmernd. Bedeutsamer sind die vielfältigen Alkoholfolge- bzw. -begleiterkrankungen. Dasselbe trifft für das Rauchen und Opiate zu. Beim Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrom und der HIV-Enzephalopathie handelt es sich nicht um direkte Folgen des Suchtmittels, sondern um indirekte Komplikationen. Die Wernicke-Enzephalopathie verläuft oft oligosymptomatisch bzw. mit „atypischen“ Symptomen, so dass sie sehr häufig nicht erkannt wird und dann unbemerkt in ein Korsakoff-Syndrom mündet. Suchtmittelkonsum und Sucht-Folgeerkrankungen können auf verschiedene Weise im Sinne der zerebralen Multimorbidität zur Entwicklung degenerativer Demenzerkrankungen beitragen. Diese Rolle des Alkoholmissbrauchs als Kofaktor ist epidemiologisch offenbar am wichtigsten, sie wird die mit zunehmendem Alter immer bedeutsamer. Geringfügiger bis mäßiger Alkoholkonsum ist nicht mit einem erhöhten Demenzrisiko verbunden. Schwerwiegender als die kognitiven Einbußen sind möglicherweise die Beeinträchtigungen der Lernfähigkeit durch chronischen Drogeneinfluss, die soziales Lernen, den Erwerb von Copingmechanismen und Stressbewältigungsfertigkeiten behindern und damit zu Persönlichkeitsveränderungen beitragen. Dies gilt bei Langzeitanwendung wohl auch für Benzodiazepine in therapeutischen Dosierungen. Die Gefahren sind umso größer, je jünger und unreifer das Gehirn ist. Außerdem besteht eine deutliche Beziehung zur kumulativen Dosis.",

Physical dependence is an adaptive state in which cessation of drug use or administration of an antagonist produces physical withdrawal signs. Psychic and physical dependence can exist together or independently. Tolerance refers to the need to take an ever-increasing dose of a drug to achieve the desired effect or to prevent craving or physical withdrawal (1).",

Evidence of intrauterine or postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation or other neurologic abnormalities, and at least two of the typical facial features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Newborns with the syndrome may be irritable, with hypotonia, severe tremors and withdrawal symptoms. Mild mental retardation, the most common and serious deficit, and a variety of other anomalies may accompany fetal alcohol syndrome. Sensory deficits include optic nerve hypoplasia, poor visual acuity, hearing loss, and receptive and expressive language delays. Atrial and ventricular septal defects, as well as renal hypoplasia, bladder diverticula and other genitourinary tract abnormalities, may occur. Complete abstinence during pregnancy is recommended, since alcohol consumption in each trimester has been associated with abnormalities, and the lowest innocuous dose of alcohol is not known.",

It describes epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for each of the excessive somnolence disorder. Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes. Hypersomnia may occur as a side effect of many drugs, due either to the soporific effects of the drug or to the effect of the drug on reducing night-time sleep.",

The consequences of frequent panic attacks, named panic disorder, are agoraphobia with impairment of psychic and social functioning, increased prevalence of alcohol abuse, depression and, in particular, suicidal attempts. It is of the utmost importance that physicians recognize the somatic symptoms of panic anxiety and plan integrated treatment. The main therapeutic resources at present include antidepressants, selected benzodiazepines and behavioral treatments and are very successful in improving panic attacks and their consequences, which may long go undiagnosed.",

      "title": "Quadri internistici ed endocrinologici connessi alla disabilitŕ grave",
      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A suddenly occurring episode characterized by perceptual alteration (SEPA), mainly of visual and/or auditory modalities, which repeatedly occurred in three schizophrenic patients on long‐term neuroleptic medication, is described. Perceptual alteration showed some distinct features that were different from acute symptoms of schizophrenia, and was accompanied by mood changes such as severe anxiety and agitation and, in one of the patients, also by extrapyramidal symptoms. Perceptual alteration, as well as mood changes and extrapyramidal symptoms, responded well to an anticholinergic drug, biperiden. Recent studies have shown that SEPA occurred not only in schizophrenic patients but also in patients on long‐term neuroleptic medication for treating other mental disorders. These findings suggest that SEPA is associated with dopaminergic hypoactivity in the brain, which is induced by long‐term neuroleptic medication.",

      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis represents a milestone in the progression of PD, often severely taxing caregivers and frequently warranting nursing-home placement. This step is often necessary because caregivers cannot tolerate, among other stressors, their loved ones' sexual aberrations and irrational accusations (which can be caused by paranoid ideation). Other salient features of parkinsonian psychosis comprise vivid nightmares, which often herald its onset; hallucinations, which are principally visual and stereotypical in content; agitation; aggression; delirium; and confusion that exceeds the typical erosion in mentation. Hallucinosis and paranoid ideation may in turn precipitate weight loss; food may be deemed inedible because of imagined contaminants, for instance, either worm infestations or a delusional fear of poisoning by the caregiver. Parkinsonian psychosis exhibits an age predilection; correlates with the duration of disease and levodopa therapy; and may be associated with increases in the dosage of this agent or other drugs given, either as monotherapy or with levodopa. Levodopa or dopamine agonist toxicity can lead to psychosis because of dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, attempts to diminish this untoward effect (eg, reducing the levodopa dosage, introducing neuroleptics) may curb the psychosis but also erode control of parkinsonian features. To avert this \"dopamine dilemma,\" we have tested a selective serotonin antagonist (ondansetron), which essentially attenuated visual hallucinosis, improved delusional ideation and confusion, and was well tolerated. Other agents that can be tried for parkinsonian psychosis include the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

      "title": "Opioid Use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Opioid use disorder is the chronic use of opioids that causes clinically significant distress or impairment. Opioid use disorders affect over 16 million people worldwide, over 2.1 million in the United States, and there are over 120,000 deaths worldwide annually attributed to opioids. There are as many patients using opioids regularly as there are patients diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, psoriatic arthritis, and epilepsy in the United States. Opioid use disorder diagnosis is based on the American Psychiatric Association DSM-5 and includes a desire to obtain and take opioids despite social and professional consequences. Examples of opioids include heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, and synthetic opioids such as oxycodone. Opioid use disorder consists of an overpowering desire to use opioids, increased opioid tolerance, and withdrawal syndrome when discontinued. Opioid use disorder includes dependence and addiction with addiction representing the most severe form of the disorder. The disease is treated with opioid replacement therapy using buprenorphine or methadone, which reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality. Naltrexone may be useful to prevent relapse. Naloxone is used to treat opioid overdose. Nonpharmacologic behavioral therapy is also beneficial. Patients with opioid use disorder often benefit from twelve-step programs, peer support, and mental health professionals, individual and group therapy. The significant prevalence of opioid use disorder stresses the importance of clinicians to understand more about opioids and be able to refer patients to available treatment centers for substance use disorders, as well as be weaned from prescription opioids due to their addictive potential and significant side effect profile. The opioid-use disorder typically involves periods of exacerbation and remission, but the vulnerability to relapse never disappears. The pattern is similar to other chronic relapsing conditions; signs and symptoms can be severe, and long-term adherence to treatment is often intermittent. Patients with opioid problems may have extended periods of abstinence and usually do well. However, there is a chronic risk of accidental overdose, trauma, suicide, and infectious diseases. The risk decreases with abstinence from opioids.",

      "title": "REGULASI KESEIMBANGAN RESEPTOR OPIOID µ DAN x DALAM MENEKAN GEJALA WITHDRAWAL PADA MENCIT YANG MENGALAMI KETERGANTUNGAN MORFIN",
      "abstract": "Dewasa ini prevalensi penyalahgunaan obat atau bahan obat golongan narkotika dan psikotropika meningkat secara eksponensial. Pada tahun 2005 United Nations Office on Drug and Crime (UNODC) melaporkan sekitar 200 juta jiwa atau 5% dari total populasi dunia menggunakan obat terlarang, dimana 2,8% dari jumlah tersebut merupakan penyalahgunaan opioid. Di Indonesia, lebih dari 1,5% dari total jumlah penduduk (± 3,2 juta jiwa) merupakan penyalahguna obat golongan narkotika dan psikotropika. Beberapa obat golongan opioid yang sering disalahgunakan adalah morfin. Penggunaan morfin secara berulang dapat menstimulasi sistem saraf pusat dimana dapat menyebabkan timbulnya adaptasi fisiologis yang dapat berkembang menjadi toleransi, ketergantungan fisik, drug craving dan relapse. Apabila pemberian morfim dihentikan secara tiba-tiba akan dapat menyebabkan timbulnya gejala withdrawal.\r\n\r\nSistem interseluler neuron dopaminergik di daerah mesolimbik (Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), striatum dan korteks) diketahui memegang peranan penting pada behavioral dan efek reward dalam ketergantungan obat. Selain itu reseptor μ, κ dan δ opioid pada neuron dalam sistem dopaminergik mesolimbik yang memodulasi transmisi dopaminergik juga memiliki peranan dalam timbulnya ketergantungan. Pada sistem ini neuron dopamin mengalami stimulasi melalui reseptor opioid μ pada interneuron GABA di VTA. Stimulasi tersebut dapat menyebabkan terjadinya peningkatan kadar dopamin pada saraf dopaminergik di NAc, amygdala dan korteks prefrontal. Studi farmakologi lain menunjukkan adanya aktifasi berulang pada reseptor opioid μ oleh agonisnya seperti morfin dapat menyebabkan timbulnya down-regulasi dari fungsi reseptor μ yang mengaktifasi reseptor yang berpasangan dengan protein G di thalamus. Down-regulasi reseptor μ opioid dapat disebabkan oleh adaptasi fisiologis dari reseptor κ danδ yang akan memediasi respon untuk menjaga homeostatis dari otak. Sudah diketahui secara luas reseptorμ opioid memiliki sifat yang berbeda atau bahkan berlawanan dengan reseptor κ opioid.\r\n\r\nBerdasarkan mekanisme tersebut, penelitian ini dilakukan untuk mengetahui potensi pemberian pra-perlakuan U-50.488H yang merupakan selektif agonis x opioid reseptor dalam menekan gejala withdrawal yang muncul pada mencit dengan ketergantungan morfin. Kondisi ketergantungan pada mencit dibuat dengan cara mencit diberikan injeksi subkutan morfin dengan dosis bertingkat 2 kali sehari selama 7 hari. Pada hari ke-8, nalokson diberikan untuk mempresipitasi timbulnya gejala withdrawal. Pengamatan terhadap gejala withdrawal dilakukan 15 menit setelah injeksi nalokson. Hasil yang didapatkan menunjukkan bahw pemberian morfim kronik dapat menyebabkan peningkatan aktifitas jumping sebesar 17.50 t 8.67 dengan nilai p = 0.027. Pada penelitian ini juga dilakukan pengamatan terhadap gejala withdrawal lain seperti diare (p = 0.000), kontriksi abdomen (p = 0.036), gangguan fungsi seksual (p = 0.035), postur abnormal (p = 0.067), iritabilitas (p = 0.035), gerakan menelan (p = 0.004) dan ptosis (0.003). Peningkatan aktifitas jumping dan frekuensi munculnya gejala withdrawal secara bermakna dapat diturunkan secara bermakna dengan pemberian pra-perlakuan U-50.488H (0-1 mg/kg, I mg/kg, 3 mg/kg dan 5.6 mg/kg) yang bersifat dose dependent manner. Pada pemberian pra-perlakuan U-50.48814 dengan dosis 0.1 mg/kg dapat menekan munculnya gejala-gejala withdrawal seperti diare (p = 0.141), gemeletuk gigi (p = 0.009), gerakan menelan (p = 0.0 17), ptosis (p = 0.038), postur abnormal (p = 0.000), iritabilitas (p = 0.069), kontriksi abdomen (p = 0.011) dan gangguan fungsi seksual (p = 0.002). Pemberian U-50.488H dengan dosis 1 mg/kg menekan munculnya gejala withdrawal seperti diare (p = 0. 119), gemeletuk gigi (p = 0. 174), gerakan menelan (p = 0.006), ptosis (p = 0.655), postur abnormal (p = 0.000), iritabilitas (p = 0.035), kontriksi abdomen (p = 0.001) dan gangguan f ingsi seksual (p = 0.230). Pada pra-perlakuan U-50.488H dengan dosis 3 mg/kg dapat menurunkan gejala withdrawal seperti diare (p = 0.067), gemeletuk gigi (p = 0.698), gerakan menelan (p = 0.132), ptosis(p = 0.549), postur abnormal (p = 0.000), iritabilitas (p = 0.069), kontriksi abdomen (p = 0.002) dan gangguan fungsi seksual (p = 0.234) dan pada pemberian pra-perlakuan U-50.488H dosis 5.6 mg/kg dapat menurunkan gejala withdrawal seperti diare (p = 0.622), gemeletuk gigi (p = 0.006), gerakan menelan (p = 0.544), ptosis (p = 0.690), postur abnormal (p = 0.008), iritabilitas (p = 0.049), kontriksi abdomen (p = 0.003) dan gangguan fungsi seksual (p = 0.777). Sedangkan pada pengaruh pemberian morfin terhadap efek sedasi yang diuji dengan menggunakan alat Rotarod, pemberian pra-perlakuan U-50.488H tidak menunjukkan pengaruh secara bermakna terhadap efek sedatif hewan coba (p = 1.000).\r\n\r\nBerdasarkan data-data diatas, dapat disimpulkan bahwa pemberian praperlakuan U-50.488H dapat menekan munculnya gejala withdrawal yang disebabkan oleh pemberian morfin kronik.",

      "abstract": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consumption of alcohol excessively causes dependence and leads to psychological discomfort. Motivation to drink is influenced by a variety of neurobiological and environmental variables. The proclivity of an individual to imbibe is thought to reflect a balance between alcohol&rsquo;s positive reinforcing (i.e., rewarding) effects, such as euphoria and anxiety reduction (i.e., anxiolysis), and the drug&rsquo;s aversive effects, which are typically associated with negative consequences of alcohol consumption (e.g., hangover or withdrawal symptoms). Neuroadaptive alterations caused by continuous alcohol use and abuse (such as tolerance and physiological dependence) are regarded to be critical in the shift from regulated alcohol use to more frequent and excessive, uncontrollable drinking which induces cerebellar degeneration considered as common type of acquired toxic ataxia. Excessive use leads to degeneration of the midline cerebellum. Progressive trunk and gait ataxia is characteristic, with little involvement of upper limbs, eyes or speech (a corollary of relative cerebellar hemispheric sparing). Abrupt termination of alcohol use after a period of heavy drinking may result in alcohol withdrawal seizures. Generalized tonic&ndash;clonic seizures are the most common and severe form of seizure in this conditions. Current case report presents complaints of astasia and slurred speech with few episodes of seizures. The diagnosis indicated Mild cerebellar atrophy.

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

La cirugia funcional ha adquirido gran relevancia en el tratamiento de las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, y menos conocida es la influencia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) en los sintomas no motores (SNM). Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia sobre ECP y SNM en la EP. Desarrollo. Los resultados de la cirugia funcional sobre los SNM de la EP son variables en los distintos estudios. Algunos sintomas mejoran -trastornos del sueno, dolor o disconfort, trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos- y empeoran o aparecen otros -fluencia verbal, apatia, aumento de peso-. En estudios aislados se encuentra mejoria en memoria de trabajo, secuenciacion visuomotora y razonamiento, algunos trastornos digestivos, genitourinarios, de termorregulacion y olfativos, y empeoran la memoria verbal (recuerdo diferido) y visuoespacial, la velocidad psicomotora y la funcion ejecutiva, mientras que otros sintomas -hipotension ortostatica- no muestran cambios. Existen otros factores, ademas de la estimulacion, que pueden modificar los SNM, como la vulnerabilidad preoperatoria individual, la disminucion de medicacion dopaminergica tras la cirugia, la propia EP y los cambios psicosociales. En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-. Conclusiones. Es necesario valorar el riesgo-beneficio individualmente para obtener resultados optimos con este tratamiento. Se requieren estudios multicentricos que permitan esclarecer el papel de la ECP sobre los SNM.",

      "abstract": "In resource-poor settings and in well-developed countries the organophosphate (OP) poisoning is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. [1]Acute OP poisoning can manifest three different phases of toxic effects, namely, acute cholinergic crisis, intermediate syndrome (IMS), and delayed polyneuropathy. [2]The IMS is a delayed onset of muscular weakness and paralysis that occurs 1-4 days after the resolution of acute cholinergic syndrome in acute OP poisoning. [3]It was first reported by Wadia et al. in 1974 [4] as \"type II paralysis after organophosphate poisoning\".In 1987, Senanayake and Karalliede termed this pattern of weakness as \"intermediate syndrome\" due to the fact that it arises between the period of early cholinergic syndrome and the late onset peripheral neuropathy. [3]he IMS occurs in 20-68% of patients following oral exposure to OP pesticides.Various factor accounts for this difference, including the nature of OP compound, severity of poisoning and inadequate Oxime therapy, etc. [5] Certain OP like parathion, methylparathion, malathion, and fenthion are commonly associated with this condition. [1]Some clinicians suggest that IMS may result from inadequate oxime therapy (subdosage, shorter duration of therapy, and modality of administration).There are other proposed mechanisms of IMS, which include different susceptibility of various cholinergic receptors, muscle necrosis, downregulation or desensitization of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors, failure of postsynaptic acetylcholine release, and oxidative stress-related myopathy. [2,4,6]Clinically, IMS is characterized by weakness in the ocular, neck, bulbar, proximal limb respiratory muscles and motor cranial nerves with occasional dystonic posturing, and was attributed to muscle fiber necrosis following acute cholinergic crisis.Extra pyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as tremor, rigidity, or dystonia as a part of IMS are very rare. [7]Although this syndrome has been described for decades, due to sometimes diverse clinical picture, it often remains undiagnosed, at least until the occurrence of significant respiratory weakness.The controversy exists regarding not only the question of whether IMS is a clearly defined entity, but also its exact etiology, risk factors, diagnostic parameters and required therapy.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is a functional brain disorder characterized by disturbances of consciousness, attention, and cognition. The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients. Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been tracked to fish kill sites in eutrophic estuaries from Delaware Bay through the Gulf Coast. Our data point to a critical need to characterize their chronic effects on human health as well as fish recruitment, disease resistance, and survival.",

      "abstract": "Ketergantungan dan penyalahgunaan zat bukan merupakan masalah baru di Indonesia. Terjadi peningkatan penyalahgunaan Narkotika, Psikotropika dan Zat Adiktif lainnya (NAPZA) di Indonesia dari tahun ke tahun, terutama penggunaan ganja karena mudah didapat. Di Indonesia terdapat antara 2-3juta orang yang pernah menghisap ganja. Penggunaan ganja dapat menyebabkan penyakit fisik (gangguan pernafasan dan kardiovaskuler) maupun mental (gangguan psikotik). Penggunaan ganja secara teratur terkait dengan munculnya gejala psikotik seperti pemikiran tidak teratur (disorganized), halusinasi, dan delusi. Umumnya para pengguna menggunakan beberapa zat, tetapi pada kasus ini hanya menggunakan satu zat saja yaitu ganja. Pada laporan ini, kami menyampaikan kasus lelaki umur 30 tahun yang mengonsumsi ganja sejak usia 17 tahun didiagnosis dengan gangguan mental dan perilaku akibat penggunaan zat multipel dan penggunaan zat psikoaktif lainnya dengan sindrom ketergantungan (F19.2) dan episode depresi sedang dengan gejala somatik (F32.11). Pasien mengalami halusinasi visual dan auditorik. Pasien mendapat terapi clozapine 25 miligram tiap 12 jam intraoral. Kasus diatas dapat disimpulkan bahwa penggunaan ganja secara kontinu memicu terjadinya psikotik.Dependence and substance abuse is not a new problem in Indonesia. There is an increase in the abuse of Narcotics, Psychotropic and other Addictive Substances (NAPZA) in Indonesia over the years, especially the use of cannabis because it is easy to obtain. Among 2-3 million people in Indonesia have smoked cannabis. The use of cannabis can cause physical illness (respiratory and cardiovascular disorders) as well as mental (psychotic disorders). Regular use of cannabis is associated with the emergence of psychotic symptoms such as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and delusions. Generally users use some substance, but in this case only use oneÂ substance that is marijuana. In this report we present the case of 30-year-old man who consumed marijuana since the age of 17 years was diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders due to multiple substances use and other psychoactive substance use with addiction syndrome (F19.2) and episodes of severely depressed somatic symptoms (F32.11). The patient experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. Patients were given 25 milligrams of clozapine therapy every 12 hours intraoral. From this case can be concluded that the continuous use of cannabis trigger the occurrence of psychotic.",

      "title": "Current management of opioid-related side effects.",
      "abstract": "The optimal management of opioid-related side effects is hampered by a lack of comparative studies of management strategies. The prevalence of such side effects is influenced by the extent of disease, the patient's age, the presence of coexistent renal and hepatic disease, pulmonary disease, and cognitive dysfunction, a prior opioid history, use of polypharmacy, dose of opioid drug being administered, and the route of administration. The most common opioid-related side effects are constipation, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and cognitive disturbance. Less frequent side effects include urinary retention, perceptual distortion, respiratory depression, and myoclonus. In an era emphasizing quality of life in cancer care, clinicians need to be aware of (1) factors that influence the prevalence of opioid-related side effects, (2) effective management strategies, and (3) how to recognize when symptoms are opioid related as opposed to caused by other etiologies, such as the patient's disease process or treatment approaches. The use of validated instruments and repeated assessment enhances such an evaluation and subsequent treatment. This article delineates the current optimal management of opioid-related nausea and vomiting, constipation, cognitive side effects, myoclonus, and respiratory depression.",

      "title": "Peripheral opioid antagonism",
      "abstract": "Opioid induced bowel dysfunction may be associated with constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating sensation and increased reflux of stomach contents. It may be unpredictable in onset, develop immediately after the first dose, persist throughout the analgesic period and, unlike the analgesia, exhibit lack of tolerance. This may follow both acute or chronic opioid intake. Acutely, it usually manifests as a part of a postoperative ileus that itself may be attributed to surgical stress, or to alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance [1]. In patients with chronic usage of opioids, the bowel dysfunction may manifest as a range of symptoms with more than half of patients experiencing constipation. While analgesia is predominantly attributed to centrally mediated opioid actions, these unwanted gastrointestinal side effects may be more peripherally related and have been associated with the enteric μ receptors [2]. This has led to the development of peripherally antagonist opioid drugs, two of which (methylnaltrexone and alvimopan) have been recently approved by the FDA (although not available in the UK yet) and release of a fixed-dose opioid agonist-antagonist combination (oxycodone and naloxone) in the UK and Europe. Methylnaltrexone (Fig. 1) is a charged, quarternary amine, a N-methyl derivative of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Addition of the methyl group confers polarity to the molecule and reduces the lipid solubility, hence reducing its passage across the blood-brain barrier [3]. Methylnaltrexone has a high affinity to the μ receptor (IC50 = 70 nmol.l−1) with some affinity to the κ receptor (IC50 = 575 nmol.l−1) and virtually no affinity to the δ receptor [3]. Methylnaltrexone is approved by the European Medicines Agency for clinical use and is administered subcutaneously in a dose of 0.15 mg.kg−1 (12 mg.0.6 ml−1 solution in a single vial) for treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced illness when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient. Methylnaltrexone. Clinically it has demonstrated a reduction in gastrointestinal time (93–110 min vs 140–163 min for placebo; 95% CI −73 to −32 min) [4]. It might be particularly beneficial for inpatients (both in postoperative and medical wards), many of whom are on long-term opioid therapy. These patients usually experience a good analgesic effect and response to opioids but have a poor compliance due to opioid induced bowel dysfunction. Methylnaltrexone has been used safely in patients on long-term methadone programmes administered both intravenously [5] and orally [6]. While it decreased oral-caecal transit time, no opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported in any of the groups. The side effects are predominantly associated with gut overactivity and may manifest as abdominal cramps and flatulence, although dose limiting orthostatic hypotension at high plasma concentrations (> 1400 ng.ml-1) has also been reported [4]. Alvimopan (Fig. 2) is a synthetic high molecular weight quarternary zwitterion (a molecule with both positive and negative regions of charge) that is a highly potent competitive antagonist at the human μ receptor. In contrast to methylnaltrexone, alvimopan has a higher affinity to the μ receptor and owes its action to its kinetics with a relatively slow dissociation from the receptors. Its oral bioavailability is only 6%, restricting its activity predominantly to the gut where it gets metabolised [7]. Although the molecule has been investigated for its efficacy in both opioid induced constipation and acute postoperative ileus, the focus in development has been primarily towards the latter. In patients who developed postoperative ileus after undergoing bowel resection and hysterectomy (Cochrane data, n = 2225) [4], alvimopan administration reduced the time to first bowel movement or flatus, or total time to pass flatus when compared with placebo [8–12]. Patients in the alvimopan group also showed a reduced requirement for postoperative X-ray and nasogastric tube insertion compared with placebo [4]. However, its use is currently limited to acute administration since, although alvimopan has demonstrated a reduction in time to first bowel movement and changes in spontaneous bowel movement frequency in patients on methadone programmes with opioid induced constipation, long-term efficacy studies have found an association between treatment with alvimopman and an increased risk of cardiovascular events (n = 7 (1.3%) vs n = 0) [13]. As these events were reported within the first 12 weeks of treatment, they may not be ultimately related to long-term duration of the dose, but there remains a need for concrete evidence with regards to the safety of the drug for its long-term usage. Alvimopan is licensed to prevent postoperative ileus in patients with a partial large or small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, and only approved for short-term use of no more than 15 doses. It is available as gelatin capsule, administered orally as 12 mg, 30 min to 5 h pre-operatively and 12 mg twice daily for 7 days postoperatively. Alvimopan. In contrast to the newer drugs, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, naloxone (Fig. 3) is a non-specific opioid antagonist that has been commonly used intravenously to reverse opioid related effects for years. Structurally a tertiary amine, it is the N-alkyl derivative of oxymorphine with substitution of the allyl group for the methyl group conferring its antagonist properties. It has a high affinity for the μ receptor and a lesser affinity for κ and δ receptors. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and is well absorbed following oral administration, where it undergoes hepatic metabolism with a low oral bioavailability of < 2% [14] This poor oral bioavailability limits any beneficial effects when administered orally in standard preparation and dosages. In theory, orally administered high doses of naloxone should be devoid of ‘central’ CNS-type effects while exerting an inhibitor effect on the ‘peripheral’ gastrointestinal system at the myenteric plexus in the gut, where μ receptors are primarily located. Oral naloxone has been studied for some time with regards to its CNS sparing action for some time and the results have been equivocal. Liu et al., [15] successfully demonstrated that naloxone administration improved bowel frequency in patients on long-term morphine and oxycodone for malignant and non-malignant pain, with patients in the naloxone group also needing more analgesia. The study was, however, inadequately powered (n = 9) to draw firm conclusions. In contrast, in a placebo controlled study of patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy (n = 43), naloxone administered epidurally alongside morphine improved constipation (p < 0.001) while there were no reported differences in pain scores between the two groups [16]. In patients who have received mechanical ventilation in the ICU on sedation/analgesia, naloxone administration via the nasogastric tube reduced both gastric reflux and pneumonia without reversing analgesia or triggering any increase in opioid requirement [17, 18]. A Cochrane review investigating the efficacy of naloxone on its own for opioid induced constipation failed to draw any positive conclusions due the variability of data and poor design of some of the studies [4]. One of the reasons may be that it is immediate release oral naloxone that has been primarily investigated in these studies; this might not outlast the longer acting opioid when used chronically. Naloxone. A new development has been the preparation of a fixed-dose of the oral prolonged-release opioid agonist, oxycodone, and prolonged-release naloxone, focussing mainly on opioid induced constipation. A placebo controlled, double-blind study, investigating the efficacy of oral prolonged-release naloxone in patients with mainly non-malignant chronic pain (n = 202) on stable prolonged-release oxycodone, reported an improvement in bowel function [19]. No loss of analgesic efficacy with naloxone was observed. In another phase-III, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study in patients with chronic non-malignant back pain (n = 463), a fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone demonstrated a superior analgesic efficacy over placebo (p < 0.001) [20]. In this study, a subset analysis of 59 patients with a higher bowel function index, (a patient-reported quantitative measure of constipation) reported a decrease in scores (improving constipation) over a period of 12 weeks. A comparative study of oral prolonged-release oxycodone vs a combination of oral prolonged-release oxycodone and naloxone, in patients with moderate to severe non-malignant pain, reported a similar improvement in bowel function without reducing analgesic efficacy [21]. Available for use in Europe since 2006 and now available in UK in a fixed-dose preparation of prolonged-release oxycodone hydrochloride/naloxone combination (10 mg/5 mg and 20 mg/10 mg), it is currently licensed for treatment of severe pain that can only be managed with opioid analgesics. Managing opioid induced gastrointestinal side effects has always been a challenge. Development of the two new, exciting, peripherally acting μ receptor antagonists, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, holds promise–especially in the acute peri-operative situation, while the unique fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone might confer therapeutic advantage in patients on chronic opioid therapy, where constipation remains the most common side effect of long-term opioid administration.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania and major depressive episodes. The diagnostic criteria for mania require the presence of distinct periods of abnormal mood characterized by euphoria, expansiveness, or irritability. The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics. Additional psychosocial treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and community engagement can also be helpful.",

Patients with opioid-induced constipation should be assessed by careful history and physical examination, and in some cases where the diagnosis is unclear with select diagnostic tests. Few clinical studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of various treatments. However, it is generally recommended that first-line therapy begin with opioid rotation, as well as with low-cost and low-risk approaches such as lifestyle changes, consumption of fiber-rich food, stool softeners, and laxatives.",

Delirium can be provoked by medical conditions, or the use or withdrawal of drugs. Risk factors include older age and cognitive impairment. Delirium is associated with many complications, represents a significant emotional burden for the patient and caretakers, increases length of stay in the hospital, and causes higher health care costs. Non-pharmacological measurements can sometimes prevent delirium, and are essential for its treatment with proven effectiveness. Antipsychotics should be administered only as an exception, not as a rule. Antipsychotics may be of use when the patient puts himself or others in danger, or when he suffers substantially from hallucinations.",

Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

MHs are characterized by perception of melodies, music, or songs. AHs/MHs can be associated with hypoacusis, psychiatric or neurological diseases, intoxication and adverse reactions of different medications (e.g., propranolol, amantadine, voriconazole).The authors present a case of a 77-year-old male with advanced heart failure, recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillations and moderate hypoacusis, who mistakenly overdosed oral amiodarone (6 pills 200 mg each daily within 3 days). After administration of 12 pills during 2 days, he started hearing music and songs not heard by others. One day later, when the number of ingested pills increased to 18, he decided to discontinue amiodarone and consulted a cardiologist; no signs of physical, ECG or laboratory deterioration were observed. MHs disappeared next day and returned only as a single episode when he tried to restart amiodarone at a dose of 1 pill daily 2 weeks later. Finally, following complete removal of the medication, he experienced no MHs whatsoever. Amiodarone is known to seldom cause neurological or mental complications; however, MHs after the drug have never been reported so far.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis in childhood and adolescence could be defined as having hallucinations, with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight. A broader definition includes symptoms such as delirious thoughts, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, cognitive and mood symptoms and what is called negative symptoms. Several researches have been done focused in the treatment of first episode of psychosis showing clozapine as a keystone in the treatment of psychosis, especially in refractory first episodes. Objectives Clozapine has unique efficacy in improving treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia but the moment of instauration remains unclear. There have always been doubts about the right moment to start clozapine, after two or more previous anti-psychotics or as first option. Materials and methods We report a 18-year- old woman with family history of severe psychosis. Her mum reasserted patient's symptoms contributing to a longer period of non-treating psychosis (about 10 months). Auditory hallucinations, incongruent mood and incoherent language appeared for the first time at the age of 17. High doses of two consecutive anti-psychotics were tried without remission and finally clozapine was initiated with clinical improvement. Discussion In clinical practice, a subgroup of psychotic patients experience, significant ongoing positive symptoms despite of using first line anti-psychotic medication. Conclusion Most recent research; suggest that clozapine may have an important role in the early treatment of first-episode patients, even becoming a first line option to consider.

      "abstract": "Until recently alcoholism was regarded as being an incurable psychological problem. During the last decade a chain of research has led to a new insight into the causes and potential alleviation of alcohol craving: Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiate-like substances (endorphins and enkephalins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin, and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroiso-quinolines), can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the craving for alcohol is related to a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiate-like substances as well as other neurotransmitter substances. This deficiency can occur genetically or as a result of prolonged stress or long-term heavy drinking. The neurochemical imbalance may be treated chemically, leading to a possible alleviation of the craving for alcohol, especially in conjunction with psychotherapeutic and counseling regimens.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "title": "Excitotoxicity, Synaptic Repair, and Functional Recovery in the Mammalian Cochlea: A Review of Recent Findings",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

      "title": "1、吗啡成瘾及吗啡对其他学习记忆的影响 2、老年猕猴初级视觉皮层细胞时间及空间特性的改变",
      "abstract": "一、 药物滥用是一种慢性、复发性脑疾病。药物滥用将导致药物成瘾（addiction），其主要表现有药物依赖、药物耐受、药物敏感化以及药物停用后的戒断症状（withdraw symptom）。药物成瘾的核心特征是强迫性觅药和用药行为。药物成瘾会导致药物滥用者认知功能的损伤和认知偏差，并会造成滥用者情绪异常。药物成瘾是一个复杂的生物学过程，有着及其复杂的机理。对药物成瘾机制的解释有很多种，主要认为成瘾过程是一种学习记忆过程，学习记忆的机制在药物成瘾过程中起到了非常重要的作用。首先，学习记忆和药物成瘾过程都受到了相似的神经营养因子以及神经递质系统的调控，例如：它们都受cAMP，CREB等调控因子的调控。其次，研究发现与成瘾相关的线索，如用药有关的人物、地点或暗示等，在药物戒断很长时间后都会恢复吸毒者的用药行为。并且，当把与成瘾相关的线索呈现给毒品戒断中的人时，这些人会出现心率、呼吸加快，血压升高等现象，甚至表现出明显的渴求行为。药物对学习记忆的影响是复杂的，虽然重复使用药物会导致药物成瘾，并且这个过程需要学习记忆机制的参与，但同时使用吗啡却会对其他类型的学习记忆（如：恐惧性学习记忆、一次性被动回避学习记忆和水迷宫空间学习记忆）造成破坏。学习前给予吗啡可以剂量及状态依赖地破坏被动回避试验以及空间辨别试验的记忆获取过程。学习过程结束后立即给予吗啡可以破坏一次性被动回避试验、主动回避试验和恐惧条件化试验的记忆巩固过程。测试前给予吗啡可以破坏空间辨别试验的记忆提取过程。本研究的目的在于更进一步地了解使用吗啡导致吗啡成瘾以及使用吗啡导致学习记忆的各个阶段受损的机制。为此我们采用了药理学以及多种行为学的方法，1、用PTZ诱发的癫痫持续状态干扰吗啡成瘾的学习记忆过程，进一步比较了吗啡成瘾的学习记忆与其他学习记忆，例如：空间学习记忆以及食物奖赏学习记忆的机制有何异同；2、研究了β-肾上腺素系统与阿片系统在空间记忆巩固过程中的相互作用；3、我们还研究了NMDA受体的激动剂和拮抗剂在吗啡破坏空间记忆提取过程中的作用。研究结果发现： 1．戊四唑诱发的癫痫持续状态，对吗啡建立的条件化位置偏好没有任何影响，动物仍然对阳性箱（吗啡匹配箱）表现出明显的偏好。但是癫痫持续状态破坏了食物建立的条件化位置偏好，并且还破坏了水迷宫和Y迷宫检测的空间记忆。癫痫持续状态破坏了食物建立的条件化位置偏好，原因不是由于其影响了动物的食欲。此外，癫痫持续状态也没有持续地破坏动物的活动能力，因此，对动物活动量的影响也不是造成其他学习记忆破坏的原因。这些结果说明，吗啡成瘾的学习记忆和普通的学习记忆在机制上可能存在不同之处。为了说明这个问题，我们还需要进行其他更深入的研究。 2、训练后立即单独注射吗啡（0.25和2.5 mg/kg）或心得安（2，10和20 mg/kg）都不会破坏动物Y-迷宫空间记忆的巩固过程，动物仍然能识别新异环境，并在里面停留较长时间。但是，训练后同时注射吗啡和心得安却可以破坏动物空间记忆的巩固过程。并且，较高剂量的吗啡（2.5 mg/kg）加上较高剂量的心得安（10和20 mg/kg）对记忆的破坏更严重，实验组动物在新异环境停留的时间显著低于对照组。这说明阿片系统和去甲肾上腺素系统在破坏记忆巩固的过程中可能有协同作用。 3、记忆提取前30分钟注射吗啡（1和10 mg/kg）可以剂量依赖地破坏Y-迷宫空间记忆的提取。单独注射NMDA受体的激动剂NMDA（1，2和4 mg/kg）对动物的空间记忆提取没有影响，但是，单独注射NMDA受体拮抗剂MK-801（0.05，0.1和0.2 mg/kg）剂量依赖地破坏了空间记忆的提取。同时注射吗啡（10 mg/kg）和NMDA（2 mg/kg）可以阻断吗啡对空间记忆造成的破坏作用。相反，共同注射吗啡（1 mg/kg）和MK-801（0.05 mg/kg）可以加重吗啡对空间记忆造成的破坏作用。这说明谷氨酸系统可以干扰吗啡对记忆提取过程的影响。 二、衰老严重地影响了人们的视觉功能，然而眼睛光学系统的老年性改变并不能完全解释清楚这种视觉功能衰退。一般认为是神经系统的退化导致了这种老年性功能降低。但是，研究显示视网膜（retina）和外膝体（dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, dLGN）在衰老的过程中神经元的数量和体积以及神经元的功能特性，如对比度敏感性、空间分辨率等，都没有明显的变化，因此，人们推测老化导致的神经系统的变化发生在更高级的视觉皮层。过去几年的研究发现老年动物视觉皮层细胞发生了一系列反应特性的改变，如：老年动物皮层细胞的方向选择性和方位选择性降低以及细胞反应的潜伏期延长。这些细胞水平的变化被认为是老年性视觉功能衰退的神经机制。为了更全面地了解衰老过程对视觉皮层的影响以及细胞反应改变与整体功能降低之间的关系，本研究采用活体动物细胞外单位记录的方法，比较了青年和老年猕猴初级视觉皮层细胞时间反应特性和空间反应特性的差异。研究结果发现：老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的时间频率和空间频率敏感性明显比年轻动物降低。表现为老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的最优时间和空间频率、空间分辨率（spatial resolution, SR）和较高时间截至频率（high temporal frequency cut-off, TF50）都显著低于年轻动物初级视觉皮层细胞，同时伴随着这些功能的降低，老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的自发放增加，对视觉刺激的反应增加，但是信噪比却显著降低。这些结果表明，老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的功能在老化过程中都普遍降低。这可能是导致老年人视觉功能降低的原因。",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Long-time consumption of narcotics leads to altered mental status of the addict. It is also connected to damages of different organic systems and it often leads to ap- pearance of multiple organ failure. Excessive narcotics con- sumption or abuse in a long time period can lead to various consequences, such as atraumatic rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and electrolytic disorders. Rhabdomyolysis is charac- terized by injury of skeletal muscle with subsequent release of intracellular contents, such as myoglobin, potassium and cre- atine phosphokinase. In heroin addicts, rhabdomyolysis is a consequence of the development of a compartment syndrome due to immobilization of patients in the state of unconscious- ness and prolonged compression of extremities, direct heroin toxicity or extremities ischemia caused by intraluminal occlu- sion of blood vessels after intraarterial injection of heroin. Se- vere hyperkalemia and the development of acute renal failure require urgent therapeutic measures, which imply the applica- tion of either conventional treatment or a form of dialysis.

We presented a male patient, aged 50, hospital- ized in the Emergency Center Kragujevac due to altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Score 11), partial respiratory in- sufficiency (pO2 7.5 kPa, pCO2 4.3 kPa, SpO2 89 %), weak- ness of lower extremities and atypical electrocardiographic changes.

Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

This may arise after exposure to enteral, parenteral, or neuraxial opioids. Opioid-associated endocrinopathy consists primarily of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and may manifest with symptoms of hypogonadism, adrenal dysfunction, and other hormonal disturbances. Additionally, opioid related endocrine dysfunction may be coupled with such disorders as osteoporosis and mood disturbances including depression. Undesirable changes in pain sensitivity such as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and reduced potency of opioid analgesia may also be potential consequences of chronic opioid consumption. Few studies to date have been able to establish what degree of opioid exposure, in terms of dose or duration of therapy, may predispose patients to opioid-associated endocrinopathy. This article will review the currently available literature concerning opioid-associated endocrinopathy and will provide recommendations for the evaluation, monitoring, and management of opioid-associated endocrinopathy and its other accompanying undesired effects.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

Case Summary: A 29-year-old white man and a 29-year-old white woman developed apathy, hypoactivity, blunted affect, depressed mood, and other depressive symptoms while taking olanzapine. Both showed a distinctly abnormal appearance. Clinicians attributed these symptoms to psychiatric illness, but the symptoms disappeared rapidly after drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Discussion: The only previous report of depression from olanzapine involved a medication interaction with fluoxetine. Another report described olanzapine-induced orbital-frontal syndrome, with childlike oversimplicity. If such symptoms are observed, the discontinuation of olanzapine is recommended. Conclusions: These observations suggest additional cautions when olanzapine is used outside of schizophrenia.",

The most common illicit substances seen include cannabis, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, inhalants, opioids, hallucinogens, and stimulants. The specific factors of substance use disorder consist of abuse, intoxication, and physical/psychological dependence. Different substances can be classified based on their effects on the central nervous system. These effects vary depending on the substance and can produce everything from increased energy and euphoria to profound sedation. In general, while the effects vary significantly, the initial stages of substance use disorders are characterized by positive reinforcement, where individuals experience a sense of well-being or euphoria with use. As physiological and psychological dependence progresses, an individual experiences negative reinforcement where substances primarily relieve dysphoria and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "title": "Perioperative opioids: Are they indispensable?",
      "abstract": "Perioperative pain is the most common cause of fear in patients undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia.[1] For ensuring a good patient experience with enhanced functional recovery, perioperative pain must be addressed satisfactorily. For many decades, opioids have been an integral component of balanced anesthesia care for their high analgesic efficacy. However, because of the several problems like opioid dependence, addiction, and drug abuse, (reported mainly from the western world, possibly because of the over prescription of opioids with limited oversight) and other side effects (respiratory depression, constipation, and nausea), has led to debate, and the introduction of new strategies like 'opioid-sparing anesthesia' and 'opioid-free anesthesia' techniques. The enhanced recovery after surgery program also recommends procedure-specific pain management strategies with particular attention to opioid-sparing.[2] 'Opioid free anesthesia' includes the administration of several non-opioid analgesics (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, neuraxial or regional analgesic techniques, and nonpharmacologic methods) plus some of the analgesic adjuncts (gabapentinoids, steroids, and infusion of intravenous lidocaine, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, and β-blocker).[34] The limitations of these techniques include ceiling effect with a small therapeutic index of safety for most of the drugs, inability to titrate the fixed-dose infusion to an effect, non-availability of objective monitoring for nociception in a patient under general anesthesia, and optimal combination of these agents or their dosing remaining unclear.[56] Above all, none of the drug combinations or techniques have been found to be superior to opioid-based analgesia. Till now, no new drugs or techniques have replaced opioids for the management of perioperative pain because of the strategic location of μ receptors (distributed throughout the pain pathway) and the role of the endogenous opioid system in regulating pain sensitivity.[7] Considering this, and the fact that poorly controlled perioperative pain is the most important independent predictor of transition from acute pain to chronic pain, the 'opioid-free anesthesia' technique seems difficult to practice. 'Opioid sparing techniques' (the multimodal analgesia wherein traditional opioid doses are reduced) is a feasible step to adequately control the postoperative pain and minimize adverse effects from individual agents. Initially, advocated to control the postoperative pain, the use of the multimodal analgesia technique has been extended to the entire perioperative period with the objective to reduce the opioid requirement.[89] The theoretical advantage of decreasing intraoperative opioid include a reduction in the dose-related perioperative adverse opioid effects as well as opioid-induced hyperalgesia.[1011] Although the multimodal analgesia technique seems feasible, its impact on the incidence of persistent opioid use after surgery and improvement in important anesthetic outcomes are still unknown. We are not aware of the magnitude of the problem of opioid dependence after perioperative prescriptions in India. Postoperative analgesia in most Indian hospitals is left to surgeons, who generally avoid the use of morphine/fentanyl. The lack of awareness on the magnitude of the problem in India could be due to insufficient follow-up of the patients postoperatively and under-reporting. The 'not so easily' available opioids, leading to widespread use of NSAIDs with weak or synthetic opioids in India suggests that the opioid-related problems could be much less severe compared to the western world. Even so, there is on-going research work, and publications addressing the issue. A systemic review on 'opioid-free onco-anesthesia' was published in the JOACP some time back[12] but the authors primarily focused on the opioid-induced immune suppression only. In the current issue of JAOCP, a narrative review on 'opioid-sparing strategies' other than regional anesthesia is published.[13] It is important to have awareness of these issues; however, the collection of quality data is an important prerequisite for research, and for arriving at appropriate country-centric strategies for perioperative pain management.",

      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "abstract": "A wide range of drugs (medicines) are used currently, many of which are designed to affect brain function. Others do so as a side-effect. The effects depend on how the body deals with the drug (pharmacokinetics) and how the drug affects the body, including the brain (pharmacodynamics). An extensive range of effects on the brain and psychological functioning can ensue, including effects on intellectual functioning, dexterity, memory, learning and subjective effects. Individual factors are important and can profoundly influence both the type and extent of drug effects. Relevant drugs can be divided into: 1. Those prescribed primarily to treat psychiatric disorders. These include sleeping tablets, tranquillizers, antidepressants and antipsychotics. 2. Those used to treat neurological disorders that have psychological side-effects. Examples are anticonvulsants and anti-parkinsonian drugs. 3. Those used to treat non-nervous disorders that may have psychological side-effects. 4. Illicit drugs used in the non-medical context by drug addicts. Drug-induced states that can influence testimony are mainly sedation, disinhibition, paradoxical reactions and alterations in memory. A list of pointers was given in this paper with respect to practical considerations in assessing the possible effects of drugs on testimony.",

Symptoms of withdrawal include autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor in the hands, insomnia, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations. One of the factors that increase the level of alcohol consumption is sex, young age, aggression, anxiety, sweating, and depression.

Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention.

      "abstract": "One of the reasons for the development or worsening of cognitive impairment (CI) may be the use of a number of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, antitumor drugs and a number of others. The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

      "abstract": "Abstract Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

In addition to physical symptoms related to nervous system hyperexcitability, withdrawal includes changes in mental state that may motivate renewed AOD consumption. The manifestations of addiction are associated with changes in nerve cell function by which the brain attempts to adapt to a drug's presence. These functional changes modulate a person's initial response to a drug, the establishment of long-term craving for the drug (i.e., addiction), and the persistent sense of discomfort that leads to relapse after abstinence has been achieved. Research is beginning to reveal how specific brain regions may be integrated to form neural circuits that modulate aspects of addiction.",

      "abstract": "<italic>Life’s Rewards: Linking Dopamine, Incentive Learning, Schizophrenia, and the Mind</italic> explains how increased brain dopamine produces reward-related incentive learning, the acquisition by neutral stimuli of increased ability to elicit approach and other responses. Dopamine decreases may produce inverse incentive learning, the loss by stimuli of the ability to elicit approach and other responses. Incentive learning is gradually lost when dopamine receptors are blocked. The brain has multiple memory systems defined as “declarative” and “non-declarative;” incentive learning produces one form of non-declarative memory. People with schizophrenia have hyperdopaminergia, possibly producing excessive incentive learning. Delusions may rely on declarative memory to interpret the world as it appears with excessive incentive learning. Parkinson’s disease, associated with dopamine loss, may involve a loss of incentive learning and increased inverse incentive learning. Drugs of abuse activate dopaminergic neurotransmission, leading to incentive learning about drug-associated stimuli. After withdrawal symptoms have been alleviated by detoxification treatment, drug-associated conditioned incentive stimuli will retain their ability to elicit responses until they are repeatedly experienced in the absence of primary drug rewards. Incentive learning may involve the action of dopamine at dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons that have recently had glutamatergic input from assemblies of cortical neurons activated by environmental and proprioceptive stimuli. Glutamate initiates a wave of phosphorylation normally followed by a wave of phosphatase activity. If dopaminergic neurons fire, stimulation of D1 receptors prolongs the wave of phosphorylation, allowing glutamate synaptic strengthening. Activity in dopaminergic neurons in humans appears to affect mental experience.",

      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "Molecular and behavioral aspects of the actions of alcohol on the adult and developing brain",
      "abstract": "The brain is one of the major target organs of alcohol actions. Alcohol abuse can lead to alterations in brain structure and functions and, in some cases, to neurodegeneration. Cognitive deficits and alcohol dependence are highly damaging consequences of alcohol abuse. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to alcohol, and that drinking during gestation can lead to a range of physical, learning and behavioral defects (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders), with the most dramatic presentation corresponding to fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent findings also indicate that adolescence is a stage of brain maturation and that heavy drinking at this stage can have a negative impact on brain structure and functions causing important short- and long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences. The effects of alcohol on the brain are not uniform; some brain areas or cell populations are more vulnerable than others. The prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the white matter and glial cells are particularly susceptible to the effects of ethanol.The molecular actions of alcohol on the brain are complex and involve numerous mechanisms and signaling pathways. Some of the mechanisms involved are common for the adult brain and for the developing brain, while others depend on the developmental stage. During brain ontogeny, alcohol causes irreversible alterations to the brain structure. It also impairs several molecular, neurochemical and cellular events taking place during normal brain development, including alterations in both gene expression regulation and the molecules involved in cell–cell interactions, interference with the mitogenic and growth factor response, enhancement of free radical formation and derangements of glial cell functions. However, in both adult and adolescent brains, alcohol damages specific brain areas through mechanisms involving excitotoxicity, free radical formation and neuroinflammatory damage resulting from activation of the innate immune system mediated by TLR4 receptors.Alcohol also acts on specific membrane proteins, such as neurotransmitter receptors (e.g. NMDA, GABA-A), ion channels (e.g. L-type Ca2+ channels, GIRKs), and signaling pathways (e.g. PKA and PKC signaling). These effects might underlie the wide variety of behavioral effects induced by ethanol drinking. The neuroadaptive changes affecting neurotransmission systems which are more sensitive to the acute effects of alcohol occur after long-term alcohol consumption. Alcohol-induced maladaptations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, abnormal plastic changes in the reward-related brain areas and genetic and epigenetic factors may all contribute to alcohol reinforcement and alcohol addiction.This manuscript reviews the mechanisms by which ethanol impacts the adult and the developing brain, and causes both neural impairments and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. The identification and the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ethanol toxicity might contribute to the development of treatments and/or therapeutic agents that could reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of alcohol on the brain.",

Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

Te nervous system affinity of alcohol is due to biochemical and metabolic characteristics of this substance: 1) Alcohol is rapidly and homogeneously distributed by body tissues and fluids, penetrating through body barriers, including the hematoencephalic one. 2) Because of its great liposolubility, it interacts with lipoid component in neuronal membrane causing long-term changes in neuronal conductance, and long-term structural changes. Behaviour disturbances in alcohol-abusing persons are related with: 1) Alcohol acute effects on neuronal membrane and synapses consisting in transitional disturbances on membrane potential and neurotransmission function. 2) Alcohol long-term effect causing by brain adjustment in synaptic transmission. 3) The relative irreversible disturbances induced by structural synaptic damage. 4) Other conditions related with alcohol abuse but not directly causing by it, such as nutritional deficiencies, and pathologic conditions seen in chronic alcoholism. In clinical practice we usually find disorders due to acute effects of ethanol on brain like different disorders related with alcohol intoxication; disorders due to tolerance development, such as withdrawal syndrome; and those chronic ad multicausal conditions with different degree of reversibility which are consequences of structural brain damage, like Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy, alcoholic neuropthaty, and alcohol induced dementia.",

Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes.

SUMMARY The medication overuse headache (MOH) is define as daily or almost daily headache (15 days or more) in patients with history of primary headache who takes excessive medications. This pathology is associated with psychiatric conditions, reason why with the time the clinical characteristics become more complex. The basic treatment is stopping the medication (analgesic, ergotamine, triptans or opioids), but this could bring us another problem called “rebound headache”, withdrawal sindrome or epileptic convulsions. These symptoms could increase the relapsing rate on this patients.",

      "title": "Acute Respiratory Failure from Abused Substances",
      "abstract": "Acute respiratory failure is a common complication of drug abuse. It is more likely to develop in the setting of chronic lung disease or debility in those with limited respiratory reserve. Drugs may acutely precipitate respiratory failure by compromising respiratory pump function and/or by causing pulmonary pathology. Polysubstance overdoses are common, and clinicians should anticipate complications related to multiple drugs. Impairment of respiratory pump function may develop from central nervous system (CNS) depression (suppression of the medulla oblongata, stroke or seizures) or respiratory muscle fatigue (increased respiratory workload, metabolic acidosis). Drug-related respiratory pathology may result from parenchymal (aspiration-related events, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, infectious and non-infectious pneumonitides), airway (bronchospasm and hemorrhage), or pulmonary vascular insults (endovascular infections, hemorrhage, and vasoconstrictive events). Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused drugs that may induce events leading to acute respiratory failure. While decontamination and aggressive supportive measures are indicated, specific therapies to correct seizures, metabolic acidosis, pneumothorax, infections, bronchospasm, and agitation should be considered. Drug-related respiratory failure when due to CNS depression alone may portend well, but in patients with drug-related significant pulmonary pathology, a protracted course of illness may be anticipated.",

Alem disso, o desenvolvimento de farmaco-dependencia e de vicio e muito pouco frequente. Primary insomnia is a dyssomnia characterized by a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep and the absence of restorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month. The polysomnographic test shows alterations in the induction, continuity and structure of sleep. Primary insomnia typically begins in young adulthood, has a chronic course, and it is more prevalent among women. Its prevalence among patients with chronic insomnia ranges from 12.5% to 22.2%. Primary insomnia must be distinguished from insomnia related to inadequate sleep hygiene or another mental disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. The treatment of primary insomnia consists of nonpharmacological strategies (sleep hygiene, behavior-cognitive therapy) and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics). Few differences exist between benzodiazepines, zopiclone and zolpidem in terms of effectiveness in inducing and maintaining sleep. However, in contrast to benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone do not suppress slow-wave sleep. Rebound insomnia and drug addiction are uncommon. Resumo Summary",

      "abstract": "Opioids strongly modulate numerous physiological and psychological functions. They may induce euphoria and analgesia, which cultures have sought for generations when administered abruptly. Chronic opioid usage alters neural circuitry and creates a drug-dependent condition. During drug withdrawal, allostatic alterations caused by drug dependence are evident. Drug use stops a temporary coordinated allostatic re-established of neural circuits, which manifest as physiology and psychological consequences that are the opposite of those seen throughout sensitive drug intoxicates. Physical withdrawal symptoms, for example, go away in a matter of days, although other symptoms, such as dysphoria, sleeplessness, and anxiety, might last. Some adaptations, like gathered connections, can become permanent. The brain circuitry, cellular processes, and opioids drug dependence suggest a potential role for neuroinflammation. The taught association involving opioids and alleviation from a preexisting or withdrawal-induced anxiogenic and dysphoric state leads to opioids-addicted behaviors. Drug cravings among susceptible persons living in an increasingly pressured environment would be fueled by a taught link between drug use and respite from unpleasant moods. We contend that the present opioids crisis in the USA is exacerbated by this path to addiction.",

      "abstract": "The author recently encountered a patient with hiccups, intermittently accompanied by apparent focal rhythmic diaphragmatic myoclonus after hydrocodone administration. Review of the literature disclosed a paucity of previous reports of hiccup, but many reports of myoclonus after opiate administration. A wide variety of opiates and routes of administration have been implicated, but high doses and the presence of other agents (antipsychotics, antiemetics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, antidepressants) may pose special risks. Review of the literature suggests three types of opiate- related myoclonus. Opiate-induced myoclonus (OIM) is often generalized and is either periodic or associated with rigidity. Opiate-induced myoclonus frequently occurs in the context of underlying medical conditions, D2 antagonist coadministration, or other drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antidepressants), and usually responds to either naloxone or benzodiazepines. Intrathecal OIM has not been linked to D2 antagonist coadministration or benzodiazepine responsiveness but may be associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Opiate withdrawal myoclonus may be stimulus- sensitive, associated with D2 antagonist coadministration, and responsive to benzodiazepines and unresponsive to naloxone. There are several problems in interpreting the literature, and more study is needed. Opiatergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and other mechanisms are considered.",

States of agitation are mainly due to simple or pathological inebriety. Any case of acute alcoholic intoxication requires a full clinical examination and a simple laboratory work-up. Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states.

      "abstract": "Objective Investigation of mental disorders in 377 patients who met ICD-10 criteria for opioid dependence. Methods Clinical observation and psychological examination. Results It was shown that mental disorders of opioid addicts consist of three types of psychopathological categories: pro-addictive phenomena (personality features and co-morbid disorders predisposing to drug abuse), meta-addictive disorders (psychopathological states gained due to drug abuse) and addictive disorders proper (craving and drug-seeking behavior). Anxiety and other neurotic symptoms are predominant types of mental disorders in opioid addicts. The core disorder of neurosis spectrum disturbances is fear of abstinence or withdrawal phobia. Withdrawal phobia determines largely negative reinforcement of drug. This phenomenon results in anticipating intake of drug and augmentation of daily drug dose. Opioid abuse leads to addictive personality deformation which including such features as constant and hypertrophied demand for positive emotional states, intolerance to frustration and other discomfort, low threshold of stress susceptibility and increased stress vulnerability, permanent urge to modulate the psychic and physical condition by dint of drug use, marked egocentricity and motivational collapse. Distorted motivational hierarchy can be illustrated by phenomenon of attractive taxis: opioid addicts show preference for the activities which lead to afford pleasure only. “Illegal exploitation” of reward system by means of drug abuse results in crucial extinction of non-rewarding routine activities (such as work or studies). Conclusion It appears that a stability of neurotic spectrum disorders and addictive personality deformation is the principal reason of low efficiency of opioid dependence treatment.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "title": "The Analgesia Nociception Index: Tailoring Opioid Administration",
      "abstract": "Opioids remain a cornerstone for perioperative analgesia, albeit frequently associated with side effects, most of them are dose dependent. Intraoperative opioid administration aims to blunt sympathetic-mediated response to nociception and is usually based on surrogate parameters such as tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, or movement. These symptoms have low sensitivity and specificity in detecting nociceptive stimuli, which can result in underdosage or overdosage of opioids administered during anesthesia. Misadministration of opioids contributes to increasing the incidence of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, the latter being of paramount importance, as it contributes to increasing postoperative pain and may initiate mechanisms responsible for chronic pain.1 These complications of nociception and its treatment lead to the need for additional information about nociception during surgery, which could help caregivers personalize the way they deliver opioid analgesia and hence increase the quality of care. Several monitoring solutions to assess intraoperative nociception have been developed in the past years, based on cortical-derived (electroencephalographic) or subcortical-derived (sympathetic–parasympathetic [pS] balance) signals responding to nociceptive stimuli; however, no system to date has demonstrated clinical benefit that would justify their routine use.2 Heart rate variability analysis has been widely used to assess the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in many clinical fields in awake and anesthetized patients.3 However, few studies focused on nociception measure and analgesia guidance in anesthetized patients for 2 reasons: the first is the complex interactions between hypnosis, nociception, and cardiovascular drugs during surgery, and the second is technical, because rapid changes of autonomous activation during surgery often lead to nonstationary signals on which classical heart rate variability measurement tools cannot be applied properly. Recently, the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) monitor (MDMS, Loos, France) has been commercialized by a spinoff of the University Hospital of Lille and its Center for Innovative Technologies (CIC IT 1403 INSERM, University Hospital of Lille, France). The method applied by the ANI monitor overcomes difficulties encountered by prior systems and produces a real-time reliable analysis of the pS activity of the ANS in a time window of 64 seconds. ANI computation relies on an algorithm that quantifies the relative amount of pS activity on a simple R-R series obtained noninvasively on a continuous electrocardiogram. Two electrodes placed on the chest of the patient enable staff to record a simplified electrocardiogram, detect R waves, and calculate the R-R interval. This series is then filtered using a fast wavelet transform to keep only the high-frequency band (0.15–0.4 Hz), where the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is expressed. The calculated index varies between 0 and 100 in relation to the relative pS activity: the higher the pS activity, the higher the RSA.4 Clinically, RSA can be felt by taking the pulse of a patient and feeling the brief increase in heart rate with each inspiratory movement, which is directly related to pS activity by a physiological reflex loop that links bronchial stretch receptors, the vagus node in the brainstem, and the sinus node in the heart. The first clinical trial exploring the antinociception/nociception balance with the ANI during surgery under controlled propofol anesthesia demonstrated that hemodynamic reactivity was systematically preceded by a drop in ANI to lower than 50, thus signaling an inhibition of the pS activity before significant sympathetic activation.5 Therefore, ANI values higher than 50 are considered to reflect an adequate balance between antinociception and nociception. Several studies in anesthetized adults and children have confirmed that ANI is more sensitive than heart rate and blood pressure in detecting noxious stimuli.6,7 Recently, our group demonstrated that the ANI allows adequate guidance of remifentanil in a large cohort of vascular surgery patients, resulting in low remifentanil consumption and low postoperative pain rates.8 In the current issue, Upton et al,9 examined postoperative pain scores in the recovery room from 0 to 90 minutes in patients receiving intraoperative ANI-guided fentanyl (ANI group) versus standard fentanyl administration (control group) for lumbar discectomy and laminectomy. Patients in the ANI group received intraoperative fentanyl boluses of 25 μg (patients <50 years old) or 50 μg (patients ≥50 years old) only if ANI scores decreased to lower than 50, repeating every 5 minutes until ANI scores increased to higher than 50, whereas patients in the control group received boluses of fentanyl according to \"standard practice,\" albeit this was not detailed by the authors. The results of the study demonstrated that despite similar amounts of total intraoperative fentanyl, patients in the ANI group had lower pain scores compared to the control group in the recovery room. Therefore, greater intraoperative fentanyl administration did not explain per se the difference observed in postoperative pain scores. Interestingly, the distribution of fentanyl boluses throughout the procedure was markedly different between groups: patients in the ANI group received twice as many, but half-dose, fentanyl boluses as patients in the control group. This is similar to a titration of fentanyl during the periods of greater nociception and is reflective of the higher calculated fentanyl concentration in the ANI group. Thus, it would appear that ANI monitoring helped tailor and personalize fentanyl administration to the dynamics of nociception, which could be the explanation for the reduced postoperative pain scores observed. To understand the mechanisms through which a tailored opioid administration may reduce postoperative pain, one must consider that postoperative pain is due to the local inflammatory response at the wound (primary hyperalgesia) and also to central sensitization of the central nervous system (secondary hyperalgesia) initiated via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. NMDA receptors are activated by either intense noxious stimuli (inadequate analgesia) or large opioid doses, which lower their activation threshold (excessive opioid analgesia). Furthermore, excessive amounts of intraoperative opioids lead to acute opioid-receptor desensitization that contributes to opioid inefficacy in the postoperative period.10 A plausible explanation of the findings of Upton et al9 might be that personalized opioid administration guided by ANI helped avoid NMDA receptor activation during periods of intensive noxious stimulus or excessive opioid-receptor desensitization, and reduced central hyperalgesia. To test these hypotheses, future studies that aim to better understand the benefit of customizing intraoperative opioids should separately assess primary and secondary hyperalgesia. Since postoperative pain is usually evaluated by global scales (eg, the numerical rate scale) that do not permit a distinction between these 2 mechanisms, future studies should develop better methods to assess primary and secondary hyperalgesia. ANI guidance alone may not be sufficient to decrease pain in the postoperative period. In a prior study on ANI guidance of intraoperative morphine and fentanyl in 120 patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, Szental et al11 failed to demonstrate any decrease in the intraoperative opioids or in the postoperative pain in the ANI group. Although the reason for the difference in the latter study with that of Upton et al9 is unclear, it may reflect that small doses of additional morphine administered in the ANI group failed to induce a difference in nociception, and therefore did not reduce secondary hyperalgesia compared with standard practice. Future investigations evaluating the benefit of antinociceptive ANI guidance should take into account: (1) the pharmacokinetic of the opioid used, which should have a rapid onset to promptly blunt the sympathetic response to increased nociception; and (2) the bolus size, which should be as small as possible and ideally effect the site targeted to avoid excessive administration with regard to the nociceptive stimulus. This could be most easily achieved with target-controlled administration of rapid-onset, short-duration opioids and may be realized in the near future with closed-loop administration devices. Decreasing opioid administration has become one of the goals of current anesthesia. Worldwide recommendations support the use of multimodal analgesia by combining anti-inflammatory agents, NMDA receptor–blocking agents, and regional anesthesia as one means to achieve this goal.12 Tailoring opioid administration may be another method of optimizing anesthesia by decreasing or limiting intraoperative opioid use and minimizing postoperative pain. This task would be easier with adequate monitoring of the antinociception/nociception balance. As the ANI measures the relative pS activity and thus the sympathetic–pS balance, which has been used as a surrogate for the antinociception/nociception balance, various clinical applications in anesthetized or awake adults and children have been tested or are currently under investigation. In anesthetized adults undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery, the ANI accurately differentiated hypertension related to excess of nociception and hypertension related to a prolonged tourniquet application.13 In children under sevoflurane anesthesia, the ANI assessed the effectiveness of pain release by regional anesthesia at the start of surgery.14 The ANI also helped assess postoperative pain in adults and young children as well as procedural pain in sedated critically ill patients.15,16 As the ANI assesses the ANS activity, other clinical applications are under investigation, such as the prediction of hypotension after spinal anesthesia or the evaluation of the intrinsic effect of drugs commonly used in anesthesia on the ANS. For example, recent studies have shown that ketamine and nefopam did not alter ANS activity.17 Despite the potential benefits of ANI monitoring, there are limitations to its use, including severe arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, implanted pacemakers, cardiopulmonary bypass, and the use of antimuscarinic drugs. Despite these limitations, there is no doubt that, along with the monitoring of the depth of hypnosis, the availability of an objective monitor to assess the antinociception/nociception balance may markedly change our approach to intraoperative pain management in a wide range of clinical settings.

      "title": "Penatalaksanaan Anestesi pada Operasi Epilepsi",
      "abstract": "Kejang adalah perubahan fungsi otak secara mendadak dan sementara akibat aktifitas nueron yang abnormal sehingga terjadi pelepasan listrik serebral yang berlebihan. Aktivitas ini dapat bersifat parsial atau general, berasal dari daerah spesifik korteks serebri atau melibatkan kedua hemisfer otak. Kejang disebabkan oleh banyak faktor, yaitu penyakit serebrovaskuler (stroke iskemik, stroke hemoragik), gangguan neurodegeneratif, tumor, trauma kepala, gangguan metabolik, infeksi susunan saraf pusat (SSP) seperti ensefalitis, meningitis. Penyebab lain adalah gangguan tidur, stimulasi sensori atau emosi, perubahan hormon, kehamilan, penggunaan obat-obatan yang menginduksi kejang (teofilin dosis tinggi, fenotiazin dosis tinggi), antidepresan (maprotilin atau bupropion), kebiasaan minum alkohol. Berdasarkan International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) dan International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) pada tahun 1981, epilepsi adalah suatu kelainan otak yang ditandai adanya faktor predisposisi yang dapat mencetuskan bangkitan epileptik, perubahan neurologis, kognitif, psikologis dan adanya konsekuensi sosial yang diakibatkannya. Diagnosa epilepsi ditegakkan melalui anamnesa, pemeriksaan fisik dan electroencephalography (EEG). Umumnya, epilepsi diterapi dengan obat antiepilepsi atau anti konvulsan. Apabila kejang tidak teratasi dengan obat oral, dapat dilakukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan, berupa non brain epilepsy surgery atau brain epilepsy surgery. Di Inggris, diperkirakan 0,5–2% total penduduk, menderita epilepsi, dimana 13% memerlukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan. Studi retrospektif, membuktikan, pengobatan invasif atau pembedahan pada epilepsi yang tidak respons terhadap obat oral, telah berhasil mengurangi serangan kejang. Penatalaksanaan anestesi pada epilepsi merupakan tantangan tersendiri bagi dokter anestesi. Diperlukan pemilihan gas, anestetika intravena dan teknik anestesi yang tidak memicu serangan kejang selama operasi. Interaksi dan efek samping obat anti epilepsi harus diperhitungkan saat anestesi. Anesthesia Management on Epilepsy Surgey Seizures are sudden changes in brain function and activity of abnormal neuron activity causing cerebral excessive electrical discharges. May be partial or general, comes from a spesific region of the cerebral cortex or both hemispheres. Caused by cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke), neurodegenerative disorders, tumors, head trauma, metabolic disorder, central nervous system infection (encephalitis, meningitis). Another factor are sleep disorder, sensory of emotional stimulation, hormonal changes, pregnancy, use of drugs induce seizures (theophyline high-dose, phenothiazine high-dose), antidepresants (maprotilin or bupropion), drinking alkohol. International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) in 1981, epilepsy is a brain disorder that can trigger epileptic seizures, neurological changes, cognitive, psychological and social consequences resulting. Diagnose is anamnesa, physical examnination and electroencephalography. Treated with antiepileptic drugs or anticonvulsant. If the seizures are not resolved, can be invasive or surgical therapy (non brain epilepsy surgery or brain surgery). In UK, 0,5 - 2% suffer from epilesy, 13% require surgical therapy. A retrospective study, prove that invasive treatment has succeeded. Management of anesthesia is a challenge for anesthesiology. Election necessary gas, intravenous and anesthesia techniques that do not trigger a seizure. Interaction and side effects of anti epileptic drugs should be calculated.",

      "title": "Psychedelic Therapy: A Primer for Primary Care Clinicians—Ibogaine",
      "abstract": "Background: Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid that has been used for thousands of years in rites of passage and spiritual ceremonies in West-Central Africa. In the West, it has primarily been used and studied for its anti-addictive properties and more recently for other neuropsychiatric indications, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and traumatic brain injury. Areas of Uncertainty: Ibogaine requires careful patient screening and monitoring because of significant safety issues. There is potential for cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval); without rigorous screening, fatal arrhythmias may occur. However, preliminary research suggests that co-administration of ibogaine with magnesium may mitigate cardiotoxicity. Additionally, ibogaine may have dangerous interactions with opiates, so patients who receive ibogaine treatment for opioid use disorder must withdraw from long-acting opioids. Other potential concerning effects of ibogaine include rare incidences of mania or psychosis. Anticipated transient effects during ibogaine treatment can include ataxia, tremors, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Therapeutic Advances: Robust effects after a single treatment with ibogaine have been reported. In open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ibogaine reduces heroin and opioid cravings by upwards of 50%, up to 24 weeks after the treatment. An observational study of 30 Special Operations Forces veterans with mild traumatic brain injury reported that 86% were in remission from post-traumatic stress disorder, 83% from depression, and 83% from anxiety, one month after a single-dose ibogaine treatment. Limitations: Although there are several observational and open-label studies, there is only a single double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT on ibogaine. More RCTs with large sample sizes must be conducted to support ibogaine's safety and efficacy. Conclusions: Given the promising preliminary findings, ibogaine could potentially fill a much-needed gap in treatments for challenging conditions, including opioid dependence. Ibogaine's remarkable effects in traditionally treatment-resistant, combat-exposed individuals hints at its potential in broader populations with physical and psychological trauma.",

      "title": "Predictors and motives of polydrug use in opioid users. A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review To review the recent literature on predictors and personal motives of polydrug use in opioid users with a focus on combined use of opioids with stimulants, benzodiazepines and gabapentinoids. Recent findings In North America, methamphetamine is now the most prevalent co-drug in opioid users and is responsible for high mortality rates. In Europe, opioids are rather combined with either cocaine, benzodiazepines or gabapentionoids, but recent data are lacking. Main personal motives of opioid users to combine opioids with methamphetamine or cocaine is to boost the opioid high, inhibit the withdrawal effects of heroin and have a cheaper alternative to maintain the opioid high. Risk factors of polydrug use by opioid users included being male, younger age, homelessness, high-risk sexual behavior, needle sharing, incarceration, poor mental health and recent use of cocaine or prescription opioids. The motives for co-use of opioids and gabapentinoids also include seeking a better high, lower price and to self-medicate pain/physical symptoms, including those resulting from withdrawal. Summary When treating opioid users with polydrug drug use, special attention should be paid to dosing when in opioid agonist methadone/buprenorphine treatment and to the presence of physical pain. The validity of part of the personal motives seems questionable which deserves attention when counselling opioid users with polydrug use.",

      "abstract": "The term \"alcoholic epilepsy\" is comparatively new in medicine and describes a class of inebriates who have convulsive symptoms resembling epilepsy. Some writers call it a form of delirium tremens and acute alcoholism; others consider it a distinct epilepsy due to the toxic action of alcohol on the brain centers. In some instances the craving for alcohol precedes the paroxysm or epileptic fit like an aura or premonition. Sometimes the convulsion is intensified and increased by alcohol, or in other instances it may be neutralized and the direction of the symptom changed. The sudden maniacal impulse to become narcotized by alcohol, as seen in the dipsomaniac and periodic inebriates, closely resembles epilepsy. A number of cases have been noted where a distinct convulsion preceded the use of spirits and was followed by a continued impulse to drink. When this craving was neutralized by treatment, the convulsion returned. When spirits were",

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "title": "Emerging Neuropsychiatric Toxicities of Opioids",
      "abstract": "Pain is a common complication of cancer. As a result of educational efforts, there has been an appropriate increase in the use of opioids. The increase has resulted in a greater detection of a spectrum of neuro-psychiatric adverse effects that include cognitive failure, hallucinations, delirium, severe sedation, generalized myoclonus, hyperalgesia, allodynia and seizures. Various putative mechanisms have been postulated including the neuro-sensitizing effects of opioid metabolites. Numerous metabolites including morphine-3-glu-curonide, morphine-6-glucuronide, hydromorphone 3-glucuronide, and normeperidine have been implicated. Morphine-3-glucuronide appears to cause hyperexcitability via non-opioid receptor mechanisms which are not yet well defined. Renal impairment, high opioid doses, prolonged opioid administration, borderline cognition, dehydration, neuropathic pain and the presence of other psycho-active drugs have consistently been reported to be correlates of opioid associated CNS irritability. Various strategies have been proposed for the management of opioid neuropsychiatric toxicity including opioid switches, opioid dose reductions and hydration. Psychostimulants may reverse the adverse cognitive effects of opioids. There remains a need for increased opioid availability. The standard of care for pharmacotherapy in general should apply to patients requiring opioids, including the ability of clinicians to recognize and appropriately treat toxic reactions if they occur.",

      "abstract": "A minority of headache patients have a secondary headache disorder. The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

      "abstract": "By far, the most common reasons for decline in school performance include anything from psychosocial stressors (divorce, death of a loved one or pet, new school, or bullying) to psychiatric disease (depression). These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "abstract": "Substance abuse complicates pain management. The comorbidity of substance abuse and pain is particularly problematic in the United States and Canada, substantially more than in most countries with advanced health care systems. Treatment of pain with long-term opioids, particularly in high doses, is known to be associated with substantial medical comorbidity, unintentional overdoses, and death. Treatment of opioid dependence in the chronic pain patient is necessary for effective pain management, whether or not the patient uses drugs illicitly. Opioids, particularly in high doses, produce central nervous system neuroadaptations that reduce or eliminate analgesic effectiveness and enhance sensitivity to pain in general. The neuroadaptations often result in opioid dependency and, in the long-term, craving. Weaning patients from chronic opioids can be exquisitely difficult if simple dose reduction is attempted. The process can be quite successful and gratifying, however, if certain principles are followed. These include education, comfortable detoxification using long-acting opioids, usually methadone or buprenorphine, nonopioid pain management, psychological support, and coordinated care.",

These phenomena can occur shortly after patients have started to take antipsychotics, for some time or even for a long time after. Patients who choke frequently or take rapid, irregular breaths interspersed with groans or sighs need to be observed closely. Risk factors are high doses of and long-term use of antipsychotics. Clinical examination of the gag reflex and the respiration contributes very little to an unequivocal diagnosis of swallowing disorders. However, swallowing disorders can be identified reliably by means of videofluoroscopy.

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "title": "Alcohol and Opioid Peptides: Neuropharmacological Rationale for Physical Craving of Alcohol",
      "abstract": "Until recently alcoholism was regarded as an incurable psychological problem. During the last decade a chain of research has led to important hypotheses about the etiology of the physical craving of alcohol. Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiatelike substances (endorphins, enkephalins, and dynor-phins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroisoquinolines) can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the physiological craving for alcohol may be the result of a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiatelike substances as well as other neurochemical deficits (i.e., dopaminergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic). These neurochemical deficits can occur genetically or as a result of long-term heavy drinking.SUMMARYScrutiny of available data reveals the following salient points: (1) Ethanol and opiates have a common biochemical mechanism of action; (2) the metabolic condensation by-products of ethanol, tetrahydroisoquinolines, link ethanol and opiate actions by virtue of interaction at multiple opioid receptor sites in the brain; (3) inbred mice showing a prediction toward alcohol preference exhibit significant differences of brain opiate peptides (endorphins and enkephalins) relative to mice showing an aversion to alcohol. Stress induces significant brain reductions of endogenous opioid peptides and induces copious alcohol consumption. Long-term ethanol ingestion remarkably reduces animal brain endorphins and enkephalins. Similarly, cerebrospinal fluid endorphin levels are reduced in human alcoholics, as are plasma enkephalin levels [40].Both acute and chronic treatment with D-phenylalanine and hydrocin-namic acid, known carboxypeptidase A (enkephalinase) inhibitors, significantly attenuate both forced and volitional ethanol intake, in mice with a genetic predisposition to prefer alcohol. These animals are known to have innate brain enkephalin deficiencies. Since these agents, through their enkephalinase inhibitory activity, raise brain enkephalin levels, we propose that excessive alcohol intake can be regulated by alteration of endogenous brain opioid peptadergic functionality and interaction with other neuroaminergic pathways.",

      "abstract": "Until not too long ago, psychogenic trance was considered to be a 'conversion hysteria'. But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "title": "Chronic opioids: a reassessment.",
      "abstract": "Opioids have long been associated with addiction and antisocial behavior. Yet recent experience and studies raise questions about the prohibition of chronic opioids in nonmalignant pain. From a purely pharmacologic point of view, opioids have perhaps the best side effect profile in our armamentarium. Studies suggest addiction is not as dependent on the nature of the drug as it is on the particular patient, some patients being highly addictable while the majority are not. Successful use of opioids for chronic nonmalignant pain depends on using them only when other measures have failed, when psychosocial and other addiction risk factors are clearly identified, and when guidelines and documentation are meticulous. Then opioids can often be used successfully to achieve good pain relief without undue risk of addiction or other side effects. The endpoint for opioid use is not the absolute dose of medications but rather the balance between benefits and side effects.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

      "abstract": "The classical syndrome of delirium has an abrupt onset. In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

The patient's behavior in these situations may be motivated by the psychological meanings, interpersonal communications, or social consequences of taking pills. The physician may be able to identify these psychosocial factors by learning about the patient's prior experiences with medications, by eliciting his views of physicians and medical care, and by understanding the consequences of becoming a patient.

Self-medication of mood disorders with legal or illicit substances is highly prevalent. Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders.

Abuse of a medication refers to excessive use of a drug to achieve a “high,” which may result in addiction to the medication and which causes dysfunction in a patient's life. However, misuse refers to usage of a medication without a prescription or for reasons other than that which it was prescribed. Diversion refers to the diverting of legally prescribed medication into illegal use by other than the patient. Sahakian and Morein-Zamir recently discussed the use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by individuals with a variety of disorders as well as off-label and non-prescription use by the general public. In addition to inappropriate use of medications, patients with ADHD often turn to other substances that are detrimental to their health, such as nicotine.",

Delirium can be precipitated by any somatic factor, which includes a variety of different illnesses, surgery, or substance (medication) intoxication or withdrawal. Predisposing factors are higher age and cognitive and functional impairment, among others. A final common pathway seems to be the most plausible for this multifactorial syndrome. The current leading candidate for the final pathway is the neurotransmitter state of relative acetylcholine deficiency and dopamine excess, together with an exaggerated inflammatory cascade. Although prevention of delirium should be the main aim, treatment consists of non-pharmacologic measures, reversing the precipitating conditions, and judicious use of antipsychotics in severely agitated patients only. Delirium is independently associated with an increase in mortality, impaired physical and cognitive recovery, and increased hospital costs.",

      "title": "Familial Dysautonomia",
      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia or the Riley-Day syndrome was first described in 1949 with a report of five cases (14). Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse is underrecognized in most patient populations. Approximately 5\" of the adult population in the world uses an illicit drug, and 1\" of adults use prescription opioids. Drugs causing intoxications can in general be divided into three groups: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Opioids act through a mu receptor present in the central nervous system. Drugs like dilaudid, morphine, methadone, and heroin all belong to the opioid family. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their activity on the postsynaptic membrane. Withdrawal from marijuana presents with mild symptoms or irritability, depression, insomnia, nausea, and anorexia. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance. Intoxication presentation may vary and include talkative, flirtatious, aggressive, moody, or disinhibited behaviors. Intoxicated patients may not be competent enough to make reasonable decisions in terms of their medical care as well as pose a potential danger to self and others.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

      "title": "Common Conditions Associated with Long Term Opioid Usage",
      "abstract": "Opioids are drugs that are used to manage wide range of chronic painful diseases. They are classified as broadspectrum analgesics. They are frequently prescribed to manage cancer and chronic pain, post-operative pain among certain other conditions. However, there is a well-known phenomenon of psychological addiction that can develop with the use of opioids leading to prolonged use, abuse and misuse which undermines their clinical efficacy associated with their use. Although in some conditions long-term opioid therapy is needed. According to clinical recommendations, long-term opioid therapy involves taking opioids every day for more than three months. The criteria for defining long-term opioid therapy in clinical settings and research, however, vary. Certain conditions are associated with its long-term use including impaired cognitive effects, sedation, constipation, nausea, vomiting, physical dependence, tolerance, and respiratory depression which are quite common with the opioid treatment. Clinical concerns regarding addiction may hinder appropriate prescribing, resulting in insufficient pain management. Delay in stomach emptying, hyperalgesia, immunologic and hormonal abnormalities, muscular rigidity, and myoclonus are examples of less prevalent effects reported with long-term opioid use. Opioid induced constipation is commonly reported in long-term use and may get severe enough to necessitate stopping the opioids and cause underdosing and insufficient analgesia. Respiratory and sleep disorders also frequently observed in longterm users of opioids. Also, incidence of new episode of depression is quite commonly linked to the chronic use of opioid. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about common conditions associated with long term opioid usage.",

What has been learned about the role of electrolytes in heart disease, and more recently in surgery, now sheds valuable light on this problem. In brief, every patient who undergoes major surgery experiences an electrolyte disturbance that may cause a psychotic or delirious reaction. Whether it does or not will depend on three factors: (1) the severity of the disturbance; (2) the treatment provided to control it, and (3) the presence of other factors which contribute to clouding of consciousness, such as sedation, hypoxia, fever, toxins, and circulatory collapse or impairment.

Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

Dependence was defined by a compulsion to take a drug, and drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome and acute disorders) and social disturbance. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

Essa doença pode afetar pessoas de todas as faixas etárias, porém, os idosos requerem uma atenção especial quando comparados às pessoas mais jovens, pelos riscos que os avanços da idade podem trazer. No Brasil, o número de idosos terá um aumento significativo até 2025, tal fato é preocupante, uma vez que pessoas idosas estão mais suscetíveis a algumas doenças, entre elas, a depressão. A depressão é vista como uma das doenças mais impactantes das últimas décadas, podendo levar ao suicídio. As causas se apresentam de forma variada e podem estar ligadas a fatores biológicos, psicológicos ou sociais. Alguns tipos de doenças, como câncer ou doenças infecciosas, abuso de álcool, perdas de pessoas próximas ou bens materiais, bem como o uso de alguns medicamentos também podem causar sintomas depressivos. O tratamento pode ser feito através de psicoterapia e de medicamentos, os quais passaram por um processo significativo de evolução no decorrer dos anos. Cabe ao farmacêutico, realizar o acompanhamento farmacoterapêutico dos pacientes, garantindo a sua segurança e orientando-os quanto ao uso correto dos medicamentos. No presente trabalho, objetivou-se analisar dados referentes à depressão em pessoas idosas, tendo como foco principal, os tipos de tratamentos disponíveis, assim como os riscos que um antidepressivo pode oferecer à saúde de um idoso. Para o desenvolvimento do estudo, foi feita uma pesquisa bibliográfica qualitativa e descritiva na literatura disponível, acerca dos pontos de maior relevância dentro do tema. A partir das informações obtidas, foi possível concluir que a atenção e capacitação dos profissionais da saúde são imprescindíveis na qualidade do atendimento ao paciente, assim como o cuidado no momento da prescrição do medicamento, já que alguns destes podem causar danos à saúde.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

      "title": "The Acute Encephalopathy of Kwashiorkor",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children with kwashiorkor often become drowsy after a few days' treatment. This usually passes off, but may deepen into coma with eventual death. This encephalopathy is not due to severe brain disruption, infection, drug toxicity, hypoglycaemia, uraemia or cholaemia. It is associated with an anomalously high hydroxyproline index and a low serum sodium during treatment. No firm conclusions can be made concerning its aetiology, but movements of water and electrolytes across the blood‐brain barrier may play an important role. The effect of standardised stimuli, such as loads of sodium, water or protein, or rapidly acting diuretics on the children's eeg might be of value. RÉSUMÉ Les enfants atteints de kwashiorkor deviennent souvent somnolents après quelques jours de traitement. Le trouble disparait habituellement, mais peut parfois s'aggraver jusqu'au coma et même éventuellement la mort. Cette encéphalopathie n'est pas dûe à une lésion grave du cerveau, à une infection, à un effet toxique de médicament, à une hypoglycémie, urémie ou cholémie. Elle est associée à un index d'hydroxyproline anormalement élevé et à un taux de sodium sérique bas durant le traitement. Il est impossible de tirer des conclusions fermes quant à l'étiologie, mais les mouvements de l'eau et des électrolytes à travers la barrière hémo‐cérébrale pourraient jouer un rôle important. L'effet sur l' eeg de ces enfants d'épreuves standardisées, telles qu'épreuves de charges en sodium, en eau ou en protéine, ou encore l'usage de diurétiques à action rapide pourraient avoir de la valeur. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG An Kwashiorkor leidende Kinder werden oft einige Tage nach Einsetzen der Behandlung schläfrig. In den meisten Fällen sind diese Bewußtseinsänderungen reversible, doch kann sich der Zustand bis zura tödlichen Coma verschlechtern. Diese Encephalopathie wird nicht durch schwere anatomische Hirnveränderungen, durch Infektion, Arzneimittel, Hypoglykämie, Urämie orde Cholämie verursacht. Die Schläfrigkeit tritt in Verbindung mit einem erhöhten Hydroxyprolin‐Index und einem niedrigen Serum‐Natriumgehalt während der Behandlung auf. Es gibt bisher keine sicheren Hinweise für die Ätiologie, es ist aber möglich, daß Verteilungsstörungen von Wasser und Electrolyten an der Bluthirnschranke eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Dosierte Reizeffekte auf das Electroencephalogramm sowie Belastungen mit Natrium, Wasser oder Protein sowie schnellwirksame Diuretika könnten eventuell einen positiven Effekt haben. RESUMEN Niftos afectos de kwashiorkor se ponen muchas veces soñolientos después de algunos días de tratamiento. Generalmente se recuperan de este estado, pero a veces caen en un coma y por fin fallecen. Esta encefalopatía no es debida a disrupción grave del cerebro, infección, toxicidad de drogas, hipoglucemia, uremia, ni colemia. Es asociada a un índice exageradamente elevado de hidroxiprolina y a valores bajos de sodio en el suero durante el tratamiento. No es posible hacer conclusiones firmes sobre su etiología, pero movimientos de agua y de electrolitos a través de la barrera sangre‐cerebro pueden ser importantes. Es posible que el efecto en los eeg de los niños de estímulos normalizados tales cargas de sodio, agua, o proteína, o diuréticos de acción rápida, sería de valor.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

There is emerging evidence for efficacy of psychological treatments during, following and even prior to the first episode. Important areas for further study are how different treatment modalities can interact productively, and patient and carer preferences for treatment.

      "title": "Management of opioid poisoning",
      "abstract": "Abstract Opioids are ‘morphine like’ substances that have actions at specific opioid receptors (especially µ receptors) in the central nervous system (CNS). Tolerance of respiratory depression develops at a slower rate than analgesic tolerance, placing patients with a long history of opioid use at particular risk for respiratory depression. If chronic users abruptly stop taking opioids, they develop an acute withdrawal syndrome. Most opioid toxicity is the result of inadvertent overdosage during recreational use or in self-harm, but it can also be due to medication misuse and drug errors. It is characterized by three main clinical features (all may not be consistently present); depressed respiratory rate (the sine qua non of opioid poisoning) and respiratory volume, and reduced arterial oxygen desaturation, CNS depression, and small or pin-point pupils. Opioid-poisoned patients require early clinical assessment, appropriate administration of intravenous naloxone (competitive opioid antagonist) and meticulous respiratory supportive care, with close observation. Because of the longer half-life of opioids than naloxone, repeated doses may be needed for long-acting opioids or large doses of shorter acting opioids. If opioid antagonists are given to regular opioid users in excess, they can precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms. The need for ITU admission usually occurs as a result of a complication of the opioid toxicity.",

Moreover, usual screening tests and diagnostic questionnaires are often not suited for the aged. Psychopathology of addictions in the aged points out vulnerabilities not resolved with the advance in age, in connection with separation, narcissism, oral regression, alexithymia and other pathological dimensions of personality. The weight of the environment, dominated by a certain agism, remains a brake to the global care that must be based, as in younger adults, on motivational approach and specific treatments with special pharmacological vigilance.",

      "abstract": "Depuis les années 2000, il existe aux États-Unis une « crise des opioïdes ». Cette crise est définie par l’augmentation massive et sans précédent du nombre de décès par overdose d’opioïdes. La particularité de ces overdoses réside principalement dans l’implication d’opioïdes prescrits initialement à visée antalgique et secondairement, objet de mésusage, alors que les overdoses des années 80–90 impliquaient majoritairement l’héroïne. Ce phénomène a pour genèse différents facteurs, pour la plupart non limités au seul territoire américain, qui se sont déroulés dans les années 90 et qui ont conduit à une prescription large des opioïdes dans les douleurs non cancéreuses. En Europe et en France, on observe également, mais dans une bien moindre mesure, une augmentation de la consommation des opioïdes forts et de la morbi-mortalité liée à leur prescription. Cette situation que l’on peut qualifier de préoccupante aujourd’hui, et non de crise comme aux États-Unis, nécessite une prise de conscience de tous en amont (prescription rationnelle des opioïdes) et en aval (savoir reconnaître et prendre en charge une intoxication par opioïdes) de la prescription d’opioïdes.Since the 2000s, a concerning increase in opioid-analgesic-related overdoses and deaths has been reported in the United States. In contrast with opioid overdoses reported in the 80-90s mostly involving heroin, currently it is the misuse of opioid analgesics that is mainly responsible for opioid overdoses. This crisis is related to factors (not limited to the US) which occurred during the 90s and which have led to a broad prescription of opioids in non-cancer pain. In Europe and France, there is (but to a much lesser extent) an increase in strong opioid consumption and in opioid prescription related morbi-mortality. This situation, which can be described as “worrying” today, requires awareness among the French medical community, both upstream (rational prescription of opioids) and downstream (optimal management of opioid poisoning) from the opioid prescription.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by repetitive and compulsive drug-seeking behavior and drug abuse despite negative health or social consequences. Cocaine addiction is a significant worldwide public health problem, which has somatic, psychological, psychiatric, socio-economic and judicial complications. Some of the most frequent complications are cardiovascular effects (acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, increased blood pressure); respiratory effects (fibrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, alveolar haemorrhage, asthma exacerbation; emphysema), neurological effects (strokes, aneurysms, seizures, headaches); risk for contracting HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, sexual transmitted disease and otolaryngologic effects. Other complications are not discussed here. The vast majority of studies indicate that there are cognitive deficits induced by cocaine addiction. Attention, visual and working memories, executive functioning are affected in cocaine users. Psychiatric complications found in clinical practice are major depressive disorders, cocaine-induced paranoia, cocaine-induced compulsive foraging and panic attacks.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine, administered orally to patients with endogenous depressive illness, did not consistently affect vital signs or depressive symptomatology, but it did decrease rapid eye movement sleep and total sleep time. When administered intravenously in the context of a therapeutic interview, cocaine caused large, rapid increases in pulse and blood pressure concomitant with profound mobilization of affect and tearfulness. Infusions that caused lesser changes in vital signs were associated with milder degrees of affective change and less dysphoria. Thus, while cocaine was capable of eliciting positive affective change (such as calmness and elation) in depressed patients, affective flooding and dysphoric components were often admixed, indicating that cocaine's effect in this context could not be classified simply as antidepressant.",

Since pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics change with increasing age of the patient, there are a number of particular features of the use of psychotropic drugs in the elderly that urgently need to be taken into account. Geriatric patients usually require only about one-half the dose needed by younger patients, and not only the side effects of psychotropic drug treatment but also, and in particular, possible interactions with other medications must also receive appropriate consideration.",

      "abstract": "Background: Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) refers to a phenomenon whereby opioid administration results in a lowering of pain threshold, clinically manifest as apparent opioid tolerance, worsening pain despite accelerating opioid doses, and abnormal pain symptoms such as allodynia.Aim: The current review, while providing a clinically oriented updated overview on the pathophysiology of OIH, focuses predominantly on evidence-based clinical and management aspects of this important and often baffling phenomenon.Method: Online and manual search using key words such as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, opioid-induced abnormal pain sensitivity, opioid hyperalgesia, opioidinduced paradoxical pain, or opioid-induced abnormal pain, followed by full-text access and further crossreferencing.Results: The underlying pathophysiology of this phenomenon, although still unclear, appears to be related to an opioid-induced imbalance between the internal antinociceptive and pronociceptive systems. Clinical differentiation of an apparent opioid tolerance state includes OIH. Once diagnosed or provisionally considered, treatment strategies could include opioid dose reduction, opioid rotation, use of agents with NMDA receptor antagonism, and a properly timed coxib.Conclusion: Despite initial skepticism and reservations, the phenomenon of OIH in humans is now accepted a clinical reality and a challenge faced by anesthesiologists, intensivists, pain specialists, and other workers in a diverse range of settings from perioperative care to palliative care medicine.",

Epilepside nöbetleri önlemek ve bireyin yaşam kalitesini arttırmak için antiepileptik ilaç tedavisi uygulanır. Kullanılan ilaç tedavisi nöbetlerin türüne ve sıklığına göre monoterapi ya da politerapi şeklinde değişiklik gösterir. Epilepsi hastalarında nöbetlerin kontrol altına alınmasında tedaviye uyum çok önemlidir. Tedavi uyumu bireyin ilaçları uygun dozda ve zamanında kullanma, sağlık bakım çalışanlarının önerilerine ve diyetine uyma, yaşam biçimi değişikliklerini daha olumlu sürdürme davranışı olarak tanımlanmaktadır. Epilepsi tedavisine uyumu birçok faktör etkilemektedir. Bunlar; hasta ile ilgili faktörler (demografik, sosyokültürel, davranışsal), hastalıkla ve tedaviyle ilişkili faktörler, sağlık ekibi ve sağlık sistemi ile ilgili faktörler olarak sınıflandırılabilir. Yeterli uyum sağlayamayan bireylerde nöbet geçirme olasılıkları, sağlık hizmet kullanım sıklığı ve sağlık bakım maliyetleri artar.

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Opioids for acute pain management in children",
      "abstract": "Opioids are integral to multimodal analgesic regimens in children with moderate to severe acute pain. Throughout normal childhood there are marked changes in physiology, and social and psychological development that influence the perception and expression of pain, the pharmacology of opioids, and how they are used. A multidimensional pain assessment is key to guiding appropriate opioid prescribing. Most of the commonly used opioids in adults are used in children, with the increasing exception of codeine (as a result of regulatory change), and are generally well tolerated. Patient groups at increased risk of ventilatory impairment include neonates and those with obstructive sleep apnoea, severe neurodevelopmental conditions, trisomy 21, and severe epilepsy. Slow-release opioids are not recommended for general use, but may be used in select populations, for example, following scoliosis surgery, major trauma or burns. Prescribing and administration errors are a major issue in paediatrics generally; the potential consequences of opioid prescribing or administration errors are serious, particularly following hospital discharge. Opioids prescribed at discharge are frequently in excess of a child’s analgesic requirements; three to five days supply appears sufficient for the majority of common paediatric operations. Discharge opioid prescriptions have been linked to long-term opioid use in adolescents with risk factors. Misuse of prescription opioids by adolescents is also concerning, with prevalence estimates ranging from 1.1% to 20%. Caregivers have a tendency to underdose opioids in their children; caregiver education may improve appropriate administration. Caregivers must also be provided with instructions on safe storage and disposal of unused opioids.",

As alterações neuropatológicas marcantes da DA são placas difusas e neuríticas, marcadas pela deposição extracelular de beta-amiloide, e emaranhados neurofibrilares, compostos pelo acúmulo intracelular de proteína tau hiperfosforilada. Os déficits cognitivos aparecem e progridem insidiosamente, o comprometimento da memória, especificamente a perda de memória de eventos recentes, é a característica mais frequente da DA e geralmente é sua primeira manifestação. Outros déficits cognitivos aparecem com ou após o desenvolvimento do comprometimento da memória. A disfunção executiva e habilidades visuoespaciais prejudicadas tendem a ser afetadas precocemente, enquanto déficits na função da linguagem e sintomas comportamentais geralmente se manifestam mais tarde. Os sintomas neuropsiquiátricos e comportamentais são comuns nos estágios intermediários e tardios da DA, mas podem ocorrer no início do curso em alguns pacientes. Os déficits neurológicos não cognitivos, sinais motores piramidais e extrapiramidais, mioclonias e convulsões podem ocorrer nos estágios finais da DA, mas são incomuns nos estágios iniciais e intermediários. As apresentações atípicas incluem uma variante visual (atrofia cortical posterior), uma variante com afasia progressiva e uma variante com disfunção executiva progressiva como sintoma predominante. As apresentações atípicas são mais comuns em pessoas mais jovens com DA. A DA é inexoravelmente progressiva, mas a taxa de progressão pode variar. A expectativa média de vida após o diagnóstico foi relatada entre 8 e 10 anos, mas pode variar de 3 a 20 anos. A DA deve ser suspeitada em qualquer idoso com início insidioso, declínio progressivo da memória e pelo menos um outro domínio cognitivo que leve ao funcionamento prejudicado.",

A relatively high risk of depression should always be considered when pharmacotherapy applied, especially if current depressive episodes, positive family history, or neurotic personality traits increasing susceptibility to depressogenic effects. Prior to start of medical treatment, the potential effectiveness of the given drug should be precisely evaluated, and alternative medical and non-medical treatment options should also be carefully considered. In addition, monitoring patients during treatment for signs of depressive or anxious symptoms is necessary. Orv. Hetil., 2013, 154, 1327–1336.",

Die häufigste endokrine Erkrankung, die zu einer Obstipation führen kann, ist der Diabetes mellitus, während das Vorliegen einer Hypothyreose als Obstipationsursache überschätzt wird. Aus der Gruppe der neurologischen Erkrankungen kann die Obstipation durch Mitbeteiligung des enterischen Nervensystems sogar eine Primärmanifestation des Morbus Parkinson darstellen. Eine Obstipation findet sich häufig auch bei psychiatrischen Erkrankungen im Rahmen von Somatisierungsstörungen oder als Medikamentennebenwirkung. Weitere seltene sekundäre Obstipationsformen können im Rahmen von neurogenen oder myogenen Systemerkrankungen auftreten. <b><i>Schlussfolgerung: </i></b>Die Therapie sollte primär immer die Therapie der Grundkrankheit sein bzw. es sollte bei der medikamentös induzierten Obstipation ein Medikamentenwechsel so weit möglich sein. Symptomatisch können alle medikamentösen Verfahren wie bei der primären Obstipation eingesetzt werden. Konservative Verfahren, die je nach Grunderkrankung und Obstipationstyp angewendet werden können, sind Kolonmassage, Biofeedback, Irrigationstherapie sowie spezielle Stimulationsverfahren.",

They are generally associated to multiple conditions that are frequent in elderly age, such as pain, somatic disease or cognitive deterioration and to psychosocial factors (loneliness, impoverishment, discapacity or mourning). Depression in the elderly has an important impact on the quality of life and general health in this age and noticeably casts a shadow over the functional prognosis or survival related with the concomitant medical diseases. It also contributes, in a large degree, to the stress of the caregiver. In the daily clinical practice, depression in the elderly is underdetected and undertreated in spite of the effectiveness of the treatments available. In the antidepressive drug treatment in the elderly, it is important to achieve its effectiveness without jeopardizing safety. The experience in the use of bupropion as an antidepressant in elderly patients is presented.",

Major variables that will be decisive also include the agreed-upon goals of treatment. The purpose in removing symptoms may include trying to prevent suicide, restoring work and interpersonal function, or enhancing the patient's capacity to participate in psychotherapy. The patient was in an agitated state, overwhelmed by fearful ruminations to the degree that he could not think clearly, or concentrate on anything including his psychotherapy, and had developed early waking insomnia. Many who need psychotherapy will be denied it to avoid short-term cost.

      "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of alcoholism in the elderly population are tendentially underestimated. There are some reasons for this fact. The pathway to the diagnosis of alcoholism may be considerably compromised in the often comorbid or multimorbid patient. To live up to an advanced age seems to be a good argument against chronic substance abuse. Elderly people and their relatives are often still more reluctant to report about socially stigmatizing disorders. On top of that, the amount of social control is reduced after the end of employment and upon entering retirement. Yet, if alcohol-withdrawal symptoms occur, e.g., following an admission of the addicted patient to a hospital, the missed diagnosis of alcoholism means a delay of the correct interpretation of such complications and of the necessary treatment. Aged patients with reduced physical and mental reserve capacity are at special risk of developing further serious complications. Progressive, sometimes irreversible decay of the cognitive functions in long lasting delirious states or, as an aftermath of withdrawal, epileptic seizures are of particular importance.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive multisystem disorder affecting both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons. Whereas dopaminergic (mainly motor) symptoms are well-defined, the nondopaminergic symptoms (mainly nonmotor, such as depression, cognitive decline, anxiety, apathy, fatigue, sleep disorders, sensory symptoms, postural control deficits, orthostatic hypotension, and urogenital and gastrointestinal symptoms) are frequently missed or neglected during routine clinical visits; consequently, they are underinvestigated and undertreated. The neglect of nondopaminergic symptoms is surprising because i) they occur in almost all patients with PD throughout the course of the disease,(1) and can even precede the occurrence of the classic motor symptoms; ii) they affect almost all aspects of daily life; and iii) have a greater effect on health-related quality of life than dopaminergic symptoms.(2) During the last decade, several initiatives have addressed this deficit with specific assessment procedures for application in clinical practice and research.(1.)",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Interventions for Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

Users of hallucinogenic drugs may present with unintentional PCP overdoses. Toxicological laboratory analyses are essential to establish the diagnosis. In nine admitted overdose patients, the consciousness level ranged from alert to comatose on presentation, and all showed a prolonged recovery phase with agitation and toxic psychosis. Severe behavior disorder, paranoid ideation, and amnesia for the entire period of in-hospital stay are characteristic. In very high dose patients, shallow respiratory excursions and periods of apnoea and cyanosis coincided with generalized extensor spasm and spasm of neck muscles. Excessive bronchial secretions, gross ataxia, opisthotonic posturing, and grimacing occur. PCP toxic psychosis should be considered in drug-abusing patients presenting with schizophrenic-like symptoms, psychosis, or other bizarre behavior, whether or not they admit to taking PCP.",

The first patient had also used cocaine, cannabis and alcohol, while the second patient had only used the hallucinogenic mushrooms. Both patients were treated symptomatically and survived despite their severe stab wounds. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used as mind-altering drugs. These drugs may sometimes induce 'bad trips', a psychotic reaction accompanied by fear, panic, and dangerous behaviour, especially when used in combination with other drugs and alcohol or by psychiatrically unstable patients. During a bad trip, patients may hurt themselves. Because the duration of the psychotic and sympathicomimetic effects of psilocybin after ingestion of mushrooms is short (up to 6 h), and since psilocin itself causes no permanent organ toxicity, the treatment of psilocybin intoxication is only symptomatic. The diagnosis ofpsilocybin intoxication is hampered by the lack of routinely available, rapid and sensitive, analytical methods for the quantification ofpsilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin.",

Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe.

Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

These can include: (1) early life (e.g., genetic or environmental) factors; (2) physiological factors including increased motor reactivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which may be enabled by postinfectious events, and dysregulation of brain–gut communication (e.g., altered central pain control mechanisms). In addition, psychosocial factors including psychiatric co-morbidity, major trauma (e.g., abuse history), and maladaptive coping may amplify the clinical expression of the disorder and its outcome. Currently, clinical outcome has become understood in terms of global symptom relief and health-related quality of life.",

In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

Cuando se prescribe un anticonvulsivante es importante tener en cuenta que muchos de los adultos mayores tienen otras comorbilidades y estan tomando otros medicamentos. Estos principios aplican tambien en el manejo de estado epileptico. Nuevo anticonvulsivantes de uso intravenoso como acido valproico, Levetiracetam y Lacosamida, pueden ser una opcion en el manejo del estado epileptico cuando las medicaciones convencionales estan contraindicadas o no pueden empleadas por sus efectos secundarios.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

Stabilisation is usually by opioid substitution treatments, and aims to ensure that the drug use becomes independent of mental state (such as craving and mood) and independent of circumstances (such as finance and physical location). The next stage is to withdraw (detox) from opioids. The final stage is relapse prevention.

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

This is a condition that can have long-term effects (especially if the duration is &gt;30 minutes) such as death, injury, and changes in neuronal tissue depending on the type and duration of the seizure. The human brain consumes a very disproportionate amount of energy given its relatively small size, thus requiring a system capable of balancing cellular oxygen metabolism and brain blood flow control in order to maintain brain oxygen levels. Seizures have been shown to cause changes in oxygen levels beyond the normoxic range, which increases the likelihood that seizure-induced changes in brain pO2 may affect brain function during and after seizures. Decreased oxygenation is common during epileptic seizures. This has been seen on digital pulse oximetry (which measures oxygenation of either the fingers or toes) in the 25-33% saturation range when they have seizures. Such hypoxemia is more common in seizures that are generalized (ie begin as or become generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and/or prolonged.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

Case reports have described dyskinesia occurring in patients with several antipsychotics withdrawn, but studies on amisulpride withdrawal dyskinesia are lacking.A 63-year-old man, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 49, received amisulpride treatment since age 62. The dosage of amisulpride was reduced from 200 to 50 mg/day because of occurrence of akathisia during one admission. Severe withdrawal dyskinesia, mixed with dystonia and akathisia, was noted immediately after the dosage reduction. The abnormal involuntary movement showed improvement 2 weeks later when the dosage was increased to 100 mg/day.Withdrawal dyskinesia and other abnormal involuntary movements could be noted in a patient with reduction of amisulpride dosage or sudden termination. Withdrawal dyskinesia may subsequently lead to persistent tardive dyskinesia. Therefore, withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia should be promptly identified, and appropriate medical interventions should be given early.",

With some drug like cocaine, stroke appear to be the result of a direct effect. In young subjects without other risk factors provide persuasive evidence for causality . OPIATES: Heroine is the most abused opiate drug, which is administered by injection, by snorting or by smoking. Stroke affects heroin users by diverse mechanisms,. Injectors are at risk of infections endocarditis, which carries risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs after rupture of a septic (mycotic) aneurysm. Heroine users can are also at risk for hemorrhagic stroke secondary to liver failure with deranged clotting and to heroin nephropathy with uremia or malignant hypertension. In some heroin users the drug it self is directly causal due to vasculitis, hypersensitivity and immunologic changes. Embolization of foreign material to brain due to mixed of heroine with quinine can cause cerebral embolism. AMPHETAMINE AND other psychostimulants: In abuser of amphetamine hemorrhagic stroke can occur, oral, intravenous, nasal, and inhalational routes of administration have been reported. Most were chronic user, but in several patients, stroke followed a first exposure. Some of amphetamine induced intracranial hemorrhages are secondary to acute hypertension, some to cerebral vacuities, and some to a combination of two. Decongestants and diet pills: Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), an amphetamine – like drug, in decongestants and diet pills, induce acute hypertension, sever headache, psychiatric symptoms, seizures and hemorrhagic stroke. Ephedrine and pseudo ephedrine are present in decongestants and bronchodilators and induce headache, tachyarrhythmia, hypertensive emergency, and hemorrhagic and occlusive stroke. Ecstasy, 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamin (MDMA) with amphetamine like can induce ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Crack cocaine: medical complication of crack cocaine is stroke. Parenteral cocaine users are at risk of stroke related to infectious endocarditis and also experience stroke caused directly by the drug itself.",

      "title": "Drug Dependency",
      "abstract": "The legal and illegal use of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens, is markedly increasing. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may cause severe acute or chronic symptoms; one cannot predict adverse reactions or relate them to frequency and length of LSD use. Among its effects are acute psychologic changes, including psychosis; and chronic alterations, such as apathy, psychosis, and \"flashback.\" Chlorpromazine is recommended for treatment of symptoms; psychotherapy and education help prevent further LSD use. Chronic amphetamine use may lead to toxic psychosis, confusion, or brain damage; acute withdrawal may lead to depression, with suicidal ideation, and increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with nightmares and insomnia. Chronic use of barbiturates and nonbarbiturate hypnotics may lead to mental impairment, motor incoordination, and depression. Withdrawal produces weakness, irritability, and occasionally convulsions or psychosis. Amphetamines and hypnotics should be withdrawn gradually and patients educated as to possible physiologic alterations, both those patients dependent on large doses and those who have taken therapeutic doses for some months. Withdrawal of these drugs leads to marked increases in REM sleep, nightmares, and insomnia, which may lead to drug dependency. Marijuana may change time sense and visual and auditory perceptions. Chronic use frequently indicates underlying psychologic disturbances needing psychotherapy. Psychoactive drugs differentially affect responses of various autonomic systems. Central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs do not induce only one condition and cannot be simply classified as excitants or depressants. The physiologic alterations produced by psychoactive drugs are basic to drug dependency as are personality factors.",

In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

Patients suffering primarily from migraine or headache caused by tension are susceptible to this affect due to their massive consumption of medication. The frequent or daily intake of painkillers or migraine medication over periods of weeks or months may lead to a new type of headache characterised by dull, pressure-like and diffuse permanent pain. The appropriate therapy in this case is a withdrawal of analgesics, for which the patient needs to be hospitalised. The recovery process after hospitalisation depends heavily on the after treatment. Factors for a favourable prognosis are the length of the abuse period (less than 5 years), the use of dihydergot as a pain-killer, motivation of the patient and the support of the family and the patient's immediate environment.",

      "abstract": "Opioids affect the central nervous system and are known to produce dizziness, sleepiness, mood changes, and other actions that in some people have a negative impact on psychomotor or mental performance. The negative effects can be exacerbated in persons who are taking other prescription medications or illegal substances. Opioid-abusing drivers clearly represent an unnecessary danger to the public; although the vast majority of patients taking prescription opioids for pain safely drive to work and other activities, a subset may be impaired, but not be aware of or recognize the problem. The majority of pain patients would likely be surprised to learn that the legal systems in most parts of the world, including most states in the United States, do not differentiate between a pain patient taking a prescribed opioid at the right dose and frequency, and an abuser taking an illegal drug. For example, in some parts of the United States, a driver may be initially stopped for a relatively minor offense and, if the officer notices that the driver is wearing a fentanyl patch, charged with driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). The present narrative review attempts to highlight the existing problem, the different legal thresholds for arrest and prosecution for DUID, and the challenge of trying to have zero-tolerance for driving under the influence of a drug used illegally, while at the same time not arresting legitimate patients who are taking pain medication as prescribed. There is a clear and present need for an integrated assessment and addressing of the current confounding situation.",

Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

With mild hypoxia, lowered levels of blood oxygen may produce symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, clumsiness, and poor judgment. Patients may behave as if they are intoxicated. When individuals remain at very high altitudes for long periods of time, mental status changes may ensue. Changes in mental state, however, may be prominent, signaling a gradually developing or worsening hypoxia. Worsening hypoxia or anoxia will lead to loss of consciousness and may cause irreversible brain damage or death.

Examples of neurodevelopmental disorders in children include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, learning disabilities, intellectual disability (also known as mental retardation), conduct disorders, cerebral palsy, and impairments in vision and hearing. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders can experience difficulties with language and speech, motor skills, behavior, memory, learning, or other neurological functions. While the symptoms and behaviors of neurodevelopmental disabilities often change or evolve as a child grows older, some disabilities are permanent. Diagnosis and treatment of these disorders can be difficult; treatment often involves a combination of professional therapy, pharmaceuticals, and home-and school-based programs.",

      "abstract": "Les problèmes d’une consommation excessive chez les sujets âgés (+ de 65 ans) sont sous-estimés, sous-identifiés, sous-diagnostiqués et sous-traités. Une des raisons est probablement la confusion sur ce qui peut être attribué à l’âge ou aux effets de l’alcool. De plus, ces derniers imitent certains symptômes d’autres maladies et troubles, par exemple les troubles anxieux, la dépression ou la démence. La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress. L’efficacité des interventions brèves dans le cas d’abus d’alcool chez les adultes âgés a été soulignée par ses résultats. L’approche clinique cognitive sur les addictions met l’accent sur l’importance des croyances concernant le produit d’alcoolisation. Certaines trouvent leur source dans l’âge de la personne.",

Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life.

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

      "title": "Amphetamine Use as a Risk Factor for Low-Dose Risperidone–Induced Acute Dystonia",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia is defined as sustained abnormal postures or muscle spasms that develop within 7 days of starting or rapidly raising the dose of an antipsychotic medication.1 Risk factors include young age, male sex, previous instance of acute dystonia, use of psychoactive substances, rapid titration, and use of high-potency antipsychotics.2 Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have a lower risk than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) to induce acute dystonia, significant differences exist between SGAs in their ability to induce extrapyramidal symptoms.3,4 The following case report describes a young male patient abusing amphetamine who, shortly after initiating low-dose risperidone, developed acute dystonia that did not occur with olanzapine use.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 24 year-old man, was admitted because of paranoid delusional thinking and agitation following daily use of amphetamine. He had no other medical history. A few months earlier, he had been hospitalized in the exact same circumstances and was treated successfully with olanzapine 10 mg daily without presenting any motor anomalies. Olanzapine was prescribed after discharge from the hospital, but Mr A stopped the medication a few weeks later. When he was readmitted more than 4 months later, risperidone orally disintegrating tablet 2 mg was introduced at bedtime. The following morning, the patient developed a sensation of thick tongue, had difficulty swallowing his saliva, and experienced neck and jaw rigidity. No respiratory difficulty was noticed. Within 30 minutes following the administration of diphenhydramine 25 mg intramuscularly, the dystonic symptoms diminished and resolved completely within the next few hours. Risperidone was replaced by olanzapine 10 mg at bedtime, and complete resolution of the psychotic symptoms was obtained without recurrence of dystonic symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe exact pathophysiology of acute dystonia remains unknown but probably involves blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum. It has been proposed that by blocking serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, SGAs increase dopamine release by substantia nigra neurons in the basal ganglia, which would explain the lower risk of dystonic reactions compared with FGAs. Psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, are considered a precipitating factor for acute dystonia.5,6 Although these substances may initially enhance release of dopamine in the striatum,7 their long-term use is associated with striatal dopaminergic down-regulation.8 In our case report, amphetamine abuse appears to increase the risk of an acute dystonic reaction with risperidone but not with olanzapine. One could argue that the blood concentration of amphetamine had decreased by the time olanzapine was prescribed and this could reduce the risk of dystonia. However, on the first hospitalization the patient did not have a dystonic reaction when treated with olanzapine although he was taking similar quantity of amphetamine on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nAlthough both risperidone and olanzapine have similar binding affinities to dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, only olanzapine has significant anticholinergic properties.3 In our patient, the addition of the anticholinergic drug diphenhydramine to risperidone significantly reduced the dystonic symptoms, suggesting that acetylcholine is involved in some way in the etiology of this motor side effect. In a recent study, patients at risk for acute dystonia used anticholinergic drugs more often when treated with risperidone than with olanzapine.9 Therefore, blockade of 5-HT2 receptors alone by an SGA may not be sufficient to prevent a dystonic reaction in high-risk patients. In our patient, the induction of dystonic symptoms by risperidone was not likely due to an increase in dopamine D2 blockade by risperidone, as dose equivalence studies suggest that risperidone 3 mg is equivalent to olanzapine 10 mg.10,11\r\n\r\nThis case report suggests that low-dose risperidone, but not olanzapine, can induce an acute dystonic reaction when amphetamine abuse is present. We propose that the anticholinergic activity of olanzapine, in addition to its serotonin 5-HT2 blockade, contributes to the lower risk of dystonic reaction compared with risperidone. Therefore, an SGA having both anticholinergic and anti–serotonin 5-HT2 activity might be a better choice to prevent acute dystonia in high-risk patients.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

However, in teenagers or adults, seizures are often preceded by aura and commonly manifest as focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are seen in less than half of the reported cases. Posterior or multifocal interictal discharges can be seen in patients with EE.

      "title": "Revisiting a dilemma: repetitive pain vs. opioid exposures?",
      "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that cognitive/behavioural outcomes of ex-preterm children are worse than in term-born children. Various risk factors could explain these outcomes, including the triggers of preterm labour such as perinatal infections or inflammation, or birth asphyxia, hypoxic events due to recurrent apnoea/bradycardia, prolonged mechanical ventilation, hypothyroidism, hyperbilirubinemia, protein–calorie or micronutrient deficiencies, or drug therapies such as glucocorticoids, caffeine, theophylline, morphine and others. Extrapolating from clinical observations and animal studies, several hypotheses were floated to explain the neurodevelopmental impact of NICU care, such as neuroinflammation, nutritional deprivation, impaired neurogenesis or neuronal apoptosis/excitotoxicity 1. Postulating that reductions in pain and stress may improve outcomes, as in postsurgical neonates, opiates were investigated as one strategy for providing analgesia to the sickest and most preterm neonates 2, as they experience the most frequent and prolonged exposures to pain and/or stress. Given the absence of robust conclusive results, as well as limited follow-up studies of the preterm neonates originally enrolled in large multicentre trials, the question of whether opiate exposures promote or damage preterm brain development largely remains unanswered. To answer this question, Deindl et al. compared the in-hospital and 12-month follow-up outcomes for 140 ELBW infants (<1500 grams) before and after implementation of the Vienna Protocol for Neonatal Pain and Sedation. Although cumulative opioid exposures increased sixfold between the control and intervention groups, they found no significant differences in their in-hospital and 12-month neurodevelopmental outcomes 3. Multivariable regression analyses showed that the CRIB score at birth (p < 0.001) and cumulative opioid exposures in the NICU (p = 0.006) were associated with lower scores in the Behavior Rating Scale (BRS) of the Bayley Developmental Scales (2nd Edition). Although median CRIB scores were higher in the intervention group vs. the control group (7 vs. 4, p-value not reported) and regression estimates for CRIB scores were much greater than opioid exposures (−2.91 vs. −0.04), however, the authors concluded that ‘opiate exposure increased the risk for lower BRS scores in our study population’ 3. Predictive factors for the mental (MDI) and psychomotor (PDI) developmental indices were well supported by previously published literature and therefore not surprising. The authors contrast their results with those of the NEOPAIN study 4, while discounting the differences between the two study designs. Results from a single-centre, observational, retrospective case–cohort analysis using historical controls cannot be rationally compared with a prospective, multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial using concurrent controls, which also selected patients using well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardised various other aspects of NICU care, other than randomising subjects to morphine or placebo infusions. These data, for example, are susceptible to significant selection bias, as only 15% of the original cohort (N = 949) or 38% of ELBW survivors (n = 367) contributed to the results reported in this study 3. All case–cohort comparisons with historical controls are notoriously open to unmeasured systematic bias that may result from myriad, known and unknown, temporal factors that may or may not be related to the intervention being studied. Given these limitations and those eruditely discussed by Diendl and colleagues, how important are the findings from this study? The results of this study are perhaps inadequate to dispel the rampant opiophobia prevailing in some NICUs, or an equally rampant opiophilia being practiced in others 5. The EUROPAIN study, for example, showed widely different sedation–analgesia practices between individual NICUs, within and between the 18 participating countries. Much of this clinical variability was driven by the use of opioids 5, rather than use of nonopioids or nonpharmacologic approaches. The current results, however, may serve to reassure clinicians that a systematic, protocol-driven approach to neonatal analgesia and sedation, one that incorporates routine assessments of pain/sedation using a validated scale, will very likely not lead to poorer short-term outcomes or major complications in ELBW infants. The jury is still out on the long-term effects of cumulative opioid exposures on preterm brain development, or their effects on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of premature birth. Despite multiple attempts, funding was not obtained to enable neurodevelopmental follow-up of subjects in the NEOPAIN multicentre trial. The Dutch morphine trial, modelled after the NEOPAIN protocol, however, has published a series of follow-up studies 6. A small pilot study, designed to demonstrate the feasibility of locating, contacting and recruiting school-age children from NEOPAIN many years after NICU discharge, reported preliminary findings on their long-term outcomes 7. Findings from this pilot study (N = 19) certainly cannot be related to the overall results from NEOPAIN (N = 898); thus, ascribing smaller head circumferences at 5–7 years 7 to delayed enteral feeding associated with morphine therapy in the neonatal period 4 lacks scientific validity. In the NEOPAIN trial, however, intermittent boluses of open-label morphine were associated with worse neurological outcomes 4, 8. Perhaps preterm neonates showing increased irritability, myoclonus or other clinical signs of severe IVH were misdiagnosed as having pain and thus given intravenous morphine boluses in addition to the masked study drug 4, 8. The fact that Diendl et al. found no increases in IVH among ELBW neonates despite sixfold increases in morphine exposure after their intervention, again, will reassure clinicians on the horns of this dilemma. The dilemma to treat neonatal pain with opioids, thereby courting potential risks for long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae is not unlike the effects of neonatal antibiotic use on gut microbiome and its association with subsequent inflammatory bowel disease. Yet concerns regarding analgesic use seem much greater than those regarding antibiotic use, although it is likely that preclinical evidence for anaesthetic-related neurotoxicity may have fuelled some of these concerns 9. Apart from one recent study 10, opioids had hitherto not been implicated with anaesthetic neurotoxicity in newborns – in animal or human studies. Zwicker et al. reported that a 10-fold increase in morphine exposure was associated with 5.5% reduction in cerebellar volume, which also correlated with poorer motor and cognitive outcomes 10. On the other hand, a large body of data have confirmed the long-term neurodevelopmental impact of repetitive neonatal pain. In conclusion, extravagant concerns with the immediate or long-term effects of neonatal opioids should not interfere with a real clinical need for opioid analgesia 6. Diendl et al. now provide additional evidence to support this conclusion. No conflict of interests to disclose regarding this publication.",

      "abstract": "Meige syndrome is a relatively rare type of oral facial dystonia. The dominant symptoms involve involuntary eye blinking and chin thrusting. Some patients may experience excessive tongue protrusion, squinting, muddled speech, or uncontrollable contraction of the platysma muscle. A 44-year-old Japanese male was suffering from schizophrenia. The initial presentation of his psychosis consisted of auditory hallucinations, delusions of persecution, psychomotor excitement, loosening association, and restlessness. After being prescribed several antipsychotic drugs, risperidone was started and gradually increased to 4 mg/day. The above symptoms were relieved, particularly auditory hallucination and excitement were promptly improved. Persecutory delusion, however persisted, and deteriorated. At one year after the start of this risperidone regimen, he exhibited severe blepharospasm symptoms (increased rate of eye blinking, light sensitivity) and oromandibular symptoms (trismus, jaw pain, dysarthria). He was diagnosed with Meige syndrome. His antipsychotic drug was changed from risperidone to paliperidone. Two months after switching from risperidone to paliperidone, his eye blinking, light sensitivity, jaw pain, and trismus gradually improved, although the dysarthria persisted. Six months after starting paliperidone, his symptoms of Meige syndrome were completely remitted. He has been well without relapse at 12 mg/day of paliperidone. The case suggests that Meige syndrome is relieved by changing from risperidone to paliperidone. The precise mechanism of the relief remains, however, unknown.",

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

One of the main disadvantages of the NSA is the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, especially bleeding into the digestive tract.

Results:The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity score at baseline was markedly ill (5).Initial CGI-improvement score after a week was much worse ( 6).The CGI-I worsened to very much worse (7).After introduction of quetiapine in 1 weeks' time, patient's CGI-I improved to minimally improved (3), and at discharge after 6 weeks, to much improved (2), indicating significant improvement. Conclusion:Coprophagia is a difficult to treat and is a distressing symptom.Treatment with quetiapine appears to have helped our patient.There is paucity of published studies and future large scale studies with medication and other behavioral interventions are recommended.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: el trastorno depresivo mayor es una alteración muy frecuente del estado de ánimo con gran impacto personal y social. Puede generar déficit notables en funciones psicológicas importantes como la ejecutiva, la atención o la memoria y evolucionar hasta un cuadro de pseudodemencia susceptible de mejorar con tratamiento antidepresivo.Objetivo: describir el funcionamiento de la memoria explícita en el trastorno depresivo mayor. Materiales y métodos: se hizo una búsqueda en la base de datos PUBMED con las palabras clave “major depression” (depresión mayor), “explicit memory” (memoria explícita) y “recollection memory” (memoria de recolección); se tomaron los artículos publicados después del año 2000; adicionalmente se incluyó bibliografía científica relevante para el cumplimiento del objetivo. Desarrollo: en la neuroanatomía del trastorno depresivo mayor se encuentran implicadas redes fronto-subcorticales (como las áreas prefrontales, tálamo, ganglios basales, hipocampo, entre otras). Estas estructuras pueden presentar atrofias que explicarían la persistencia o cronicidad de algunos de los síntomas cognitivos de la depresión. Las alteraciones en la memoria explícita, declarativa o de recolección, son de particular importancia por ser las más frecuentemente encontradas en sujetos con uno o más episodios depresivos mayores, y la estructura cerebral que se ha correlacionado más directamente con alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la memoria explícita es el hipocampo. Se ha observado actividad continua de neurogénesis en el hipocampo de animales adultos, la cual es especialmente susceptible cuando hay exposición prolongada a situaciones de estrés grave. Esto se evidencia en estudios que han encontrado reducido su volumen en sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor, en comparación con individuos sanos. De todas maneras, aunque no se encuentre una reducción marcada del volumen, se sugiere que hay una alteración de su funcionamiento.Conclusiones: la memoria explícita es un proceso psicológico con base biológica precisa, cuya estructura y funcionamiento se alteran en presencia de una condición menos precisa como la depresión mayor.",

The current treatment, for example with levodopa or dopamine-agonists, is complicated by response fluctuations, dyskinesias and gastro-intestinal side-effects. These, and various other reasons including fear of levodopa toxicity, have led to reluctance in starting medical treatment in PD. Especially during the last decade it has become clear that there is no scientific substrate for this reluctance. The aim should be to minimize the restraints in daily activity caused by PD, where medications including levodopa and dopamine-agonists have proven to be effective.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use. Nevertheless, these methods do not work equally well for all types of addicts.",

In those early years only hypnotics and anticonvulsants were available and they were administered chiefly for the management of excitement and agitation. The discovery of chlorpromazine (Delay & Deniker, 1952) and other neuroleptics resulted in a revolution in the treatment of psychoses of adults. It was hoped that these drugs would arrest or decrease the psychotic process in the child and that after the reduction of anxiety, hyperactivity, and/or aggressiveness he would become more amenable to special education and other treatment modalities. These hopes were not always fulfilled. Drug therapy has come under attack because of improper use, especially with institutionalized retarded Children. This abuse has included high dosage over prolonged periods of time, multiple drug usage—children receiving from two to eight drugs at the same time—no drug holidays, little or no evidence of drug monitoring, and usage of sedative types of phenothiazines which probably suppress cognitive learning functions (Lipman, 1970).",

Several neurochemical and molecular changes take place in the brain during the first phase of drug use which lead to dependence, addiction and drug abuse. DEVELOPMENT. Every drug of abuse acts through similar neurophysiological mechanisms, mostly based on the abnormal activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Although the addicted brain tries to adapted to the drug action, there are permanent neural changes at the cellular and molecular levels which seem to underlie the addictive process and the emergence of abstinence symptoms after drug taking stops. Furthermore, these neural changes appear to subserve the emergence of cravings once the abstinent syndrome has been overcome. Cravings are the main factor leading to relapse, and they are often initiated by exposure to drug related cues.",

      "title": "Commentary on Zolopa <i>et al</i> .: Trauma as an impediment to successful aging and a precipitant of opioid and stimulant use among older adults",
      "abstract": "Trauma is a key factor in conceptual models that link aging to opioid and stimulant use disorders. Early-life trauma can be a driving factor in people who use opioids and stimulants throughout their life, and later-life trauma might explain why some individuals develop new onset opioid and/or stimulant use disorders as older adults. Early life trauma can impact neurotransmitter and neurohormonal stress signaling that increases the risk of developing a substance use disorder [7]. Moreover, early life trauma is often a precipitant of dysregulated stress response and persistent anhedonia later in life, both of which can increase the risk of developing OUD and/or StimUD and contribute to the relapsing and remitting nature of these conditions [8-10]. In the context of drug use careers, early life trauma can contribute to allostatic load (e.g. a cumulative burden of chronic stress) that makes it harder for people with OUD and/or StimUD to quit over time, thus creating an impediment to successful aging [11, 12]. Social determinants of health also play a role in the link between early life trauma and substance use throughout the life-span; income inequality, marginalization, and lack of family and educational support can accelerate drug use problems when transitioning between phases of development (e.g. from adolescence to adulthood; middle to older age) [13]. Further, older adults are at higher risk than the younger population for experiencing certain traumatic events, including serious accidents [14]. Older adults also accumulate multiple adverse experiences that can be extremely distressing but are often not conceptualized as ‘trauma’ by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (e.g. deaths of loved ones, receiving a terminal diagnosis). Cumulative traumatic and adverse experiences that occur in older adulthood can increase risk factors for new-onset OUD/StimUD, namely chronic stress and anhedonia [15, 16]. Older adults are also more likely to experience chronic pain and have the highest exposure to prescription opioid analgesics compared with any other age group [17], and thus may be at increased risk to misuse opioid medications when faced with later life trauma [18]. Similarly, the prevalence rate of prescription stimulant misuse is similar to the prevalence rate of prescription opioid misuse among older adults, and serious psychological distress is associated with higher odds of misusing stimulants in this population [19]. Although trauma experienced in early life or later life might confer unique risk for developing OUD or StimUD, ongoing opioid and/or stimulant use can, in turn, increase the risk of trauma and adverse experiences (e.g. overdose, financial instability), thereby creating a vicious cycle that could begin at any point across the life-span. There is a clear role for trauma in conceptual models that explain why older adults might develop OUD and/or StimUD later in life, and understanding how trauma disrupts successful aging might identify malleable targets for treatment. Accordingly, future mechanistic research on older adults who use opioids and/or stimulants might seek to understand biological, psychological, and social pathways that link trauma to drug use by impeding successful aging. Clinical research might examine novel interventions that directly address trauma and adverse events as part of treatment for older adults with OUD/StimUD. Further, it is essential that providers working with older adults routinely assess traumatic experiences, adverse life events, and substance use in order to ensure rapid identification and treatment. Interdisciplinary research and treatment is especially important in light of the twin opioid and stimulant overdose epidemics, as well as the growing need to effectively address substance use disorders in an older population that can be clinically challenging to treat.

      "abstract": "Abstract Narcotic abuse has reached alarming proportions in many areas of the United States, carrying with it a pernicious morbidity and a tragic mortality. The latter is estimated to be approximately 0.7 percent of the addict population per annum. There were over 1000 such deaths annually in 1969 and 1970 in New York City alone. Eighty percent of these fatalities in New York are attributed to “immediate acute reactions” following administration (usually intravenous) of narcotics. In Dade County (Metropolitan Miami), Florida, 86 of 87 narcotic-related fatalities, excluding 13 violent deaths in the reported series, “collapsed and died following the injection of a narcotic”. The mechanisms of sudden death in this circumstance are complex and have not been elucidated completely. Several possible explanations include narcotic overdosage with respiratory depression, narcotic induced postural hypotension, hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction, idiosyncratic reaction to unspecified material(s), adverse response to intravenous injection of colloid or particulate material (“colloidoclastic crisis”), or adverse reactions to adulterants in narcotic packets which are purchased “on the street”.",

      "abstract": "Pituitary tumour apoplexy (PA) is a rare clinical syndrome that occurs as a result of acute haemorrhage and/or infarction within a frequently undiagnosed pituitary tumour. The sudden enlargement of the pituitary mass undergoing PA is responsible for a wide range of acute symptoms/signs (severe headache, visual loss, diplopia, hypopituitarism, impaired consciousness) which, together with the radiological evidence of a pituitary lesion, establish the diagnosis. The optimal care of PA requires involvement of a multidisciplinary team including endocrinologist, neurosurgeon, neuroophthalmologist and the management strategy that depends on the clinical manifestations, as well as the presence of co-morbidities. Prompt surgical decompression is initially indicated in cases with severe or progressive impairment of the visual acuity or the visual fields or with altered mental state and leads to visual and neurological recovery in most of the patients. The patients with mild, stable clinical picture (including those with isolated ocular palsies) can be managed conservatively (support of fluid and electrolyte balance and stress doses of steroids in most cases) with favourable visual and neurological outcome. Frequent reassessment is mandatory because the clinical course can be unpredictable; if progression of symptoms occurs, later elective surgery is indicated and is beneficial, especially in terms of visual outcome. The endocrinological outcome is less favourable, irrespective of the treatment option, with many patients remaining on long-term replacement therapy. Despite the above guidelines, clear proof of optimal outcomes in the form of randomised controlled trials is lacking. Regrowth of the pituitary tumour years after a PA episode is possible and patients require long-term surveillance.",

Not surprisingly, because of the illegality of these substances, many of these individuals die while in the custody of law enforcement. In fact, forensic pathologists have often divided these drug-related custody deaths into four different categories: (a) death during arrest and transport or soon thereafter; (b) death within 12 hours of arrest: (c) death after 12 hours, but within a few days to weeks; and (d) death after days to weeks of incarceration (2). Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibiity seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleo-vestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "title": "Isolated Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics The spectrum of isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency ranges from classic early-onset (severe) disease to late-onset (mild) disease. Classic ISOD is characterized in the first few hours to days of life by intractable seizures, feeding difficulties, and rapidly progressive encephalopathy manifest as abnormal tone (especially opisthotonus, spastic quadriplegia, and pyramidal signs) followed by progressive microcephaly and profound intellectual disability. Lens subluxation or dislocation, another characteristic finding, may be evident after the newborn period. Children usually die during the first few months of life. Late-onset ISOD manifests between ages six and 18 months and is characterized by ectopia lentis (variably present), developmental delay/regression, movement disorder characterized by dystonia and choreoathetosis, ataxia, and (rarely) acute hemiplegia due to metabolic stroke. The clinical course may be progressive or episodic. In the episodic form encephalopathy, dystonia, choreoathetosis, and/or ataxia are intermittent. Diagnosis/testing Laboratory findings that suggest the diagnosis of ISOD are dipstick positive for urinary sulfite, elevated urinary thiosulfate and S-sulfocysteine, low urinary organic sulfate, and markedly reduced plasma levels of total homocysteine. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SUOX by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No treatment exists for the underlying metabolic defect. Symptomatic treatment can include: antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizures; medications to reduce spasticity; and early consideration of gastrostomy tube placement to manage difficulties with swallowing, assure adequate caloric intake, and reduce risk of aspiration. Other measures can include vigorous chest physiotherapy to prevent respiratory complications. Treatment of vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia are per routine. Surveillance: Periodic assessment by a multidisciplinary team with particular attention to nutritional status, neurologic status (to evaluate dosages of AEDs and their side effects), and degree of spasticity and related complications. Genetic counseling ISOD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an affected child are asymptomatic obligate heterozygotes (i.e., carriers of one SUOX pathogenic variant) and are not at risk of developing the disorder. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SUOX pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Acute opioid withdrawal can be debilitating and include a range of symptoms such as anxiety, pain, insomnia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Whereas acute opioid withdrawal only lasts for 1-2 weeks, protracted withdrawal symptoms can persist for months after the cessation of opioids. Insufficient management of opioid withdrawal often leads to devastating results including treatment failure, relapse, and overdose. Thus, there is a critical need for cost-effective, nonopioid medications, with minimal side effects to help in the medical management of opioid withdrawal syndrome.

Compared with other atypical antipsychotics, it has a favorable side effect profile, but overdose experience is limited. Case Report A 3-year-old drug-naive patient accidentally ingested 200 mg of aripiprazole. This ingestion resulted in immediate lethargy with brief improvement 16 hours after ingestion and subsequent decline 2 hours later. Patient returned to baseline 72 hours after ingestion. Discussion Unlike previous case reports, this patient displayed a biphasic course of somnolence. Previous reports have described delayed onset and prolonged sedation in response to an aripiprazole overdose.

      "title": "Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology of Cocaine",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Cocaine abuse has produced a major epidemic health problem in North America in the 1980s. The abuse of cocaine is maintained by the drug's effects on brain reward systems, mediated at least in part by its dopaminergic action. The patterns and consequences of use are best understood by considering the pharmacokinetics (rapid absorption and delivery to the brain, relatively short half‐life) and the pharmacodynamics (intense central and peripheral neural stimulation). Cocaine is used therapeutically as a topical and local anaesthetic. Toxicity occurs primarily in cocaine abusers, but also occasionally after therapeutic dosing. Medical complications reflect primarily excessive central nervous system stimulation and excessive vasoconstriction, the latter resulting in severe hypertension and/or organ ischaemia with associated organ injury. Most deaths that result from medical complications of cocaine intoxication are sudden and occur before medical intervention is possible. Other complications of cocaine abuse with severe personal and social consequences include traumatic deaths and injuries, and reproductive disturbances, as well as transmission of infectious diseases, especially AIDS. Cocaine addiction is clearly a problem, although the number of addicts is unknown. Pharmacologic treatment of cocaine addiction has as yet been unsuccessful. Psychosocial approaches remain the mainstay of therapy.",

According to this hypothesis, 1 drug abuse begins as a partially successful attempt to assuage painful feelings. This does not mean seeking pleasure from the use of drugs. Rather, individuals predisposed by biological or psychological vulnerabilities find that drug effects corresponding to their particular problems are powerfully reinforcing. For example, clinical observations suggest that persons who have difficulty regulating mood may be particularly vulnerable to abuse of cocaine or other stimulant drugs, persons who have difficulty controlling anger to abuse of heroin and other opioids, and persons who have high anxiety levels to abuse of alcohol and other sedatives. Many drug abusers report that their drug helped them to feel normal, even before they developed physiological dependence with continued drug use necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms. 1 Such clinical observations are supported by the recent",

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "There are many reports of cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Many antineoplastic agents may be involved in the condition also known as \"chemo brain\" or \"chemo fog\". Two male patients (aged 41 and 70) with multiple myeloma developed severe, rapidly progressing cognitive impairment (mostly involving episodic memory) and loss of independence in activities of daily living during lenalidomide-based treatment. On withdrawal of the drug, one patient recovered normal cognitive function and independence in activities of daily living, whereas mild cognitive impairment persisted in the other patient. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was 6 out of 13 for the first patient and 5 out of 13 for the second, suggesting a probable causal relationship between the adverse event and lenalidomide administration. Lenalidomide may induce particular cognitive disorders (notably episodic memory impairments) in some patients. The drug's putative neurotoxicity is probably promoted by specific risk factors (such as previous chemotherapy, prior mild cognitive impairment, age and the presence of cerebrovascular lesions).",

Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours.

According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "title": "Hallucinatory Palinopsia in COVID-19-Induced Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Visual perseveration or palinopsia is a nonspecific term that describes multiple types of visual symptoms characterized by persistence or recurrence of previously seen visual images, which are currently absent (1). Palinopsia has been associated with a wide variety of etiologies and mechanisms, such as drug-induced, idiopathic seizures, migraine, psychiatric conditions, metabolic alterations, head trauma, and structural lesions in the brain, mainly those affecting parietal and parieto-occipital connections (1). The high-resolution afterimages that are long-lasting, isochromatic, and unaltered by environmental conditioning and motion are typical of hallucinatory palinopsia, a category of palinopsia that represents a dysfunction in visual memory and is caused by posterior cortical lesions or seizures (1). By contrast, illusory palinopsia refers to afterimages that are unformed, indistinct, or of low resolution, and are affected by environmental conditioning. This type of palinopsia is due to a dysfunction in visual perception and is caused by migraines, prescription drugs, illicit drugs, or head trauma (1). Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurological disorder with various background risk factors, protean manifestations, and characteristic neuroimaging. Albeit several visual symptoms are commonly described in PRES (2), palinopsia is so far unheard of. Neuroimaging, in particular MRI, usually shows a distinctive parieto-occipital pattern with a symmetric distribution of changes reflecting vasogenic edema (2). The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been enlisted as a cause of PRES (3–5). We herein report one patient who presented with hallucinatory palinopsia, as a predominant phenomenon, during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced PRES. A 33-yer-old right-handed (laterality index of +100, as measured by Edinburgh's Handedness Inventory) woman with 10 years of formal education visited the outpatient department with mild fever, headache, and visual symptoms. Her medical history was unremarkable. On detailed enquiry, she claimed to visualize short, previously viewed, stereotyped actions, continuously replaying for several minutes for the past 2 days. She specifically complained of seeing television images with the news anchor appearing abruptly in the field of vision in over backdrop of wall and persisting for 5–15 minutes. After the neuro-ophthalmological examination at the outpatient department, she started complaining of perceiving a superimposition of the examiner's face shield and face mask on her visual field for next few hours. These incidents occurred minutes after the original visuals, with intact shape, architecture, color, and clarity, suggestive of hallucinatory palinopsia. There was no history of visual snow, micropsia, macropsia, teleopsia, akinetopsia, pelopsia, dysmetropsia, oscillopsia, phosphenes, and photopsias. She had no history of any drug intake, addictions, migraine, seizure disorders, diagnosed demyelinating disorder, and psychiatric ailments. She had no other cognitive deficits (i.e., neglect, visual perception, language, memory, and executive dysfunction). Other neurological and ophthalmological examination findings were noncontributory (See Supplemental Digital Content, Appendix 1, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A449). Complete hemogram, electrolytes, arterial blood gas analysis, vitamin B12, liver, renal, and thyroid function tests (including antithyroid peroxidase) were normal. She tested seronegative for HIV, hepatitis B and C. Her nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Brain MRI revealed hyperintense signal changes on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-weighted images, without diffusion restriction and signal blooming in susceptibility-weighted imaging, involving predominantly bilateral parieto-occipital regions and bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal gray–white interfaces, suggestive of PRES (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance venography, angiography, computed tomography scan of thorax, cerebrospinal fluid study, and conventional (1 hour) 1–70 Hz electroencephalography were normal. After 5 days of therapy with azithromycin 500 mg daily and dexamethasone 24 mg daily (in divided doses), all the symptoms disappeared, and steroid was put off after fast tapering before discharging her on 15th day.FIG. 1.: Brain MRI displaying multifocal hyperintense signal changes in bilateral occipital gray–white interface on axial T2-weighted (A) and coronal T2-weighted (B) images. Axial FLAIR-weighted images (C, D) showing hyperintense signal changes suggestive of vasogenic edema in bilateral occipital and frontal gray–white interface.The exact pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated PRES remains unclear. Among the possible mechanisms are (3–5): 1) cytokine storm-mediated disruption of blood–brain-barrier integrity; 2) interaction of viral spike protein S1 with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors, which are expressed abundantly on capillary endothelium, resulting in endothelial damage and increased permeability of blood–brain barrier; 3) SARS-CoV-2-mediated direct neurodegeneration and cerebral edema; and 4) SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia-associated hypoxemia, resulting in augmentation of systemic inflammatory response and deranged neuronal mitochondrial metabolism. All these mechanisms may destabilize autoregulation of cerebral circulation and may cause cerebral vasodilatation, neuronal swelling, and interstitial edema leading to PRES (2). The present case had features of hallucinatory palinopsia (i.e., categorical incorporation, scene preservation, and formed image preservation), indicative of a dysfunction in visual memory encoding, processing, or retrieval (1). Lesions involving both dominant and nondominant parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices can generate palinopsia (1). Because PRES has predilection toward the occipito-parietal regions of brain, disorders of higher visual function are common in this particular syndrome. However, palinopsia as a manifestation of PRES has never been reported before. PRES has been reported in COVID-19 (3–5). In our case, it could be caused by direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on brain parenchyma because our patient did not have traditional risk factors, particularly metabolic abnormalities, known to be associated with PRES, unlike the previous reports (Table 1). Although commonest presentation of COVID-19-induced PRES is altered mental status, visual symptoms may be found at presentation as earlier depicted by Kaya et al. (5).

      "abstract": "Post-operative sleep disturbance, with suppression of rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep followed by a subsequent rebound, seems to be related to the magnitude of trauma and thereby to the surgical stress response. In this context, cortisol, autonomic stimulation, and certain cytokines may lead to abnormal sleep. Furthermore, the environment, pain and the administration of analgesics seem to be important factors in the precipitation of sleep abnormalities. Post-operative sleep disturbance may contribute to the development of episodic hypoxaemia, haemodynamic instability and altered mental status, all of which have an influence on post-operative morbidity and mortality. Prevention or reduction of the post-operative sleep disturbance may be achieved by minimizing surgical trauma, changing the conventional nursing procedures, avoiding opioids and treating pain with non-opioid analgesics, although none of these methods has been thoroughly studied. Post-operative sleep disturbance represents an important research field, since it may have a significant adverse impact on post-operative outcome.",

      "title": "The role of sevoflurane in postoperative cognitive dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Sevoflurane, a 200 dalton chemical molecule, is an inhalation anesthetic used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, which is used by a specially calibrated volatilizer.[1] As with all inhalation anesthetics, sevoflurane can cause dose-related cardiorespiratory hypofunction. Nausea and vomiting are the most common postoperative adverse effects, and other frequent adverse effects include hypotension, bradycardia, and cough.[2] Relatively rare adverse effects include elevation of aspartate aminotransferases and acute renal failure.[3] However, there are few reports of neurological effects after surgery, particularly postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). POCD is a central nervous system complication that occurs after surgery, especially in the elderly, manifested as changes in personality, social skills, cognitive abilities and skills, and degeneration of intellectual functions such as memory and concentration decline.[4] The pathogenesis of POCD mainly involves neuroinflammatory response caused by microglial activation, calcium overload-induced mitochondrial damage, and neuronal apoptosis due to oxidative stress,[5,6] all of which affect hippocampal function, resulting in a series of cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, we attempt to elucidate the mechanism, related signaling pathways, and molecular regulation of sevoflurane-induced POCD based on existing literature reports. This will help to identify possible treatments to reduce the incidence of POCD and improve the prognosis of POCD, thereby optimizing the sevoflurane anesthesia program, reducing patient discomfort, and improving the quality of life of patients. Mechanism and molecular regulation of sevoflurane-induced POCD: The mechanism of sevoflurane-induced POCD is still not well understood, and researchers explore its related molecular and pathway changes mainly through basic experiments, and the mechanism is mostly close to neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis (Table 1 and Figure 1). After treating elderly mice with sevoflurane, Chai et al.[7] found that the level of acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein-32A protein increased, which inhibited the acetylation of histones H3K18 and H3K14, thereby preventing H3K18 and H3K14 from binding to GluN2B and GluN2A promoters, causing a decrease in synapse-related protein expression, and finally leading to POCD. It can be seen that the integrity and plasticity of neuronal synaptic function are of great significance in POCD. He et al.[8] found that after treatment with sevoflurane, methyltransferase-like 3 phosphorylation in hippocampal tissue may be inactivated by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, resulting in perturbation in m6A (N6-methyladenosine) RNA methylation, which causes pathogenesis in POCD. Sleep disorders can aggravate the occurrence of POCD. Shen et al.[9] found that after sevoflurane was used to treat sleep-deprived rats, the level of salt-induced kinase 3 in the brain tissue increased, which made the levels of phosphorylation- and total-tau rise, and the level of acetylation decreased, thereby causing POCD. It can be seen that this pathophysiological process involves the salt-induced kinase 3 signaling pathway. In mouse hippocampal primary neuronal experiments, Zhu and Ma[10] found that the levels of inflammatory indicators interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α increased after treating neurons with sevoflurane. The mechanism was that sevoflurane activated Hoxa5, thereby upregulating long non-coding RNA Gm5106 and directly targeting the anti-inflammatory molecule miRNA-27-3p. Similarly, Cheng et al.[11] found that in SH-SY5Y cells, sevoflurane intervention caused elevated acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long chain family member 4 expression. Downregulation of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long chain family member 4 alleviates sevoflurane-induced ferroptotic cell death, and in-depth exploration shows that acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long chain family member 4 is involved in sevoflurane-induced ferroptotic cell death through the adenosine 3'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.[11] In a study related to ferroptotic cell death, Ge et al.[12] treated old mice with sevoflurane, and iron overload occurred in mouse brain tissue, resulting in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn led to glucose metabolism disorders. At the same time, sevoflurane also inhibits oxygen uptake and glucose absorption. In this way, the cross-dysfunction of iron and glucose causes apoptosis of cortical and hippocampal neurons through the Bcl/Bax pathway.[12] Mind bomb-2 is also an important molecule involved in ferroptotic cell death, which significantly rises in mouse hippocampal tissues after treatment with sevoflurane. Knockdown of mind bomb-2 expression reduces neuronal death and ferroptotic cell death by the fact that lowering mind bomb-2 levels reduces binding to glutathione peroxidase 4, thereby reducing glutathione peroxidase 4 degradation and enhancing glutathione peroxidase 4 stability.[13] MicroRNAs also play an important role in the pathogenesis of sevoflurane-induced POCD, particularly in relation to the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway. Zhao et al.[14] found that miR-124, which had the effect of preventing apoptosis and inflammatory response through the NF-κB signaling pathway, was inhibited in hippocampal neurons after the intervention of sevoflurane in mice. However, another microRNA has an exacerbating effect on the sevoflurane-induced inflammatory response. Wei et al.[15] found that miR-182-5p, which could be released by plasma exosomes, rose in the rat POCD model. Inhibition of plasma exosomes and miR-182-5p could relieve learning and memory impairment, reduce the level of inflammatory factors, upregulate neurotrophic factors, and inhibit NF-kB pathway.[15] In addition, studies have shown that mitochondrial autophagy is also involved in the pathogenesis of POCD, and sevoflurane treatment can inhibit mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain and autophagy flow, which will cause changes in mitochondrial morphology and affect mitochondrial autophagy function, thereby causing cognition-related disorders.[16]Figure 1:: Mechanism of sevoflurane-induced POCD.Note: Created with BioRender.com. AMPK: Adenosine 3'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-B; POCD: postoperative cognitive dysfunction.Table 1:: The mechanism of POCD induced by sevofluraneIn a neonatal rat experiment, Zhu et al.[17] found that USP1-associated factor 1 inhibits the degradation of NOD-like receptor protein 3 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which can aggravate sevoflurane-induced POCD. Therefore, downregulation of USP1-associated factor 1 reduces cognitive impairment. Mao et al.[18] conducted a study using wild-type C57BL/6 mice and protrophic factor knockout mice treated with sevoflurane. The study revealed that the presence of multi-acting proteins can worsen sevoflurane-induced learning dysfunction. However, the knockout of multi-acting proteins and the use of multi-acting protein receptor inhibitors can help mitigate sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation as well as cognitive and learning dysfunction. This suggests that pleiotrophin plays a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of POCD. However, in a separate study,[19] researchers aimed to create an aged rat model of POCD using sevoflurane anesthesia. They found that overexpression of C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 had beneficial effects such as inhibiting cell apoptosis, reducing inflammation, minimizing brain tissue damage, and improving cognitive impairment. These effects were achieved by regulating two key pathways: adenosine triphosphate-activated protein kinase/SIRT1 and phosphoinositol 3-kinase/AKT.[19] Studies have shown that miR-140-3p can negatively target DNA methyltransferase-1 to reduce 5-hydroxytryp-tamine receptor 2A promoter methylation, which upregulates 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A expression and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/Nrf2 pathway, thereby improving neuronal survival and reducing sevoflurane-induced POCD.[20] In addition, long non-coding RNA Rian can also play a protective role in neurons by regulating the miR-143-3p/LIM domain kinase 1 axis.[21] It can be seen that the molecular regulation involved in sevoflurane-induced POCD is very extensive. Therefore, it is also important and urgent to select the appropriate target to manage POCD. Management of sevoflurane-induced POCD: At present, there is no mature treatment for POCD, and the reported treatment methods are limited to animal experiments. We hope that the approach compiled will provide guidance and ideas for further treatment options. Peng et al.[22] found that cistanche, a Chinese herbal medicine, can play a role of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-microglial activation by activating the PPAR signaling pathway, thereby alleviating sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation and improving hippocampus-dependent memory loss. Chikusetsu saponin IVa, another active ingredient derived from traditional Chinese medicine, could alleviate neurological dysfunction by inhibiting the NOD-like receptor protein 3/ caspase-1 pathway to reduce apoptosis and neuroinflammation.[23] Carnosol, extracted from rosemary, can also reduce sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation, prevent microglial activation, and inhibit apoptosis, mainly by regulating the NF-kB pathway.[24] In the rat POCD model, Wei et al.[25] found that dexmedetomidine, a clinically commonly used sedative, promotes neuroactivity and reduces apoptosis by upregulating miR-129 levels that targets inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Glucagon-like peptide 1 analog liraglutide, a new type of hypoglycemic drug, has been found to improve spatial learning and memory ability of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia, and play an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect in hippocampal tissue, thereby reducing cognitive dysfunction.[26] In a study investigating the effects of different doses of vitamin D on POCD, Zhang et al.[27] found that high levels of vitamin D can improve cognitive dysfunction after sevoflurane anesthesia by enhancing hippocampal cholinergic activity and reducing the expression of inflammatory factors. A study has also shown that sevoflurane can reduce cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, block protein kinase A-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, increase apoptosis and reactive oxygen species to induce cognitive impairment.[28] Thus, roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, maintains normal levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate as well as the activity of the above signaling pathways, thereby improving rat neurological function.[28] Necroptosis, which is related to calcium overload, also plays a role in the pathogenesis of POCD in aged rats. The use of necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of necroptosis, can improve neuroprotective effects of cognitive function by increasing BDNF pathway activity and inhibiting necroptosis-related pathways.[29] In addition, it has been reported that electro-acupuncture pretreatment can alleviate sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction, and its mechanism mainly lies in inhibiting calcium overload and reducing mitochondrial damage and neuronal apoptosis of hippocampal neurons.[30] Similarly, atmospheric normobaric hyperoxia preconditioning can also reduce sevoflurane-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, thereby improving POCD.[31] Intestinal dysbacteriosis can increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in aged mice after sevoflurane surgery, thus inducing POCD. Lactobacillus may reduce the blood-brain barrier permeability to protect neurological function.[32] Conclusion: POCD induced by sevoflurane is clinically common, especially in elderly patients. Cognitive dysfunction will adversely affect the normal life of these patients. We have found that the pathogenesis of POCD lies mainly in neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and hippocampal dysfunction, but current treatments are still very limited or limited to animal experiments. Thus, we hope that these experiments may provide some guidance and new ideas for clinical treatment and give helps to these patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that is characterized by abnormal sensory experiences, or hallucinations (e.g., hearing voices that are not there); odd beliefs not shared by those around you, or delusions (e.g., that one is being followed by the FBI or that one's thoughts can be heard by nearby people); loss of normal functions such as motivation and anticipating pleasure (i.e., negative symptoms); cognitive impairment; and problems in social functioning. It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "As a highly differentiated physiological process, swallowing may be affected by a variety of confounding factors. Primarily described are swallowing disorders caused by mechanical anatomic changes (e. g., alteration of the cervical spine, goiter), surgery for head and neck tumors, thyroid abnormalities, and neuromuscular disorders. Age-related cerebral neurological and blood vessel-associated changes can also cause dysphagia (so-called presbyphagia) or worsen the condition.Medication-associated dysphagia is recognized far less frequently, not paid due attention, or accepted in silence; particularly in older patients. Furthermore, pharmacological interference of different medications is frequently inadequately considered, particularly in the case of polypharmacy.Initial treatment of medication-induced dysphagia includes a critical review of medication status, with the aim of reducing/discontinuing the causative medication by giving precise instructions regarding its administration; as well as antacid medication, diet, and professional oral stimulation or swallowing training.To date, medication-induced dysphagia has not occupied the focus of physicians and therapists. This is despite the fact that many active agents can have a negative effect on swallowing and medication-induced dysphagia caused by polypharmacy is not uncommon, particularly in old age. This article presents an overview of the different classes of drugs in terms of their direct or indirect negative effects on the swallowing function.",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder that manifests in childhood and persists into adulthood. The prevalence of ADHD (USA/worldwide) in children and adolescents is 9.5/5.29 %, in adults — 4.4/2.5 %. The disorder has strong genetic correlations with numerous mental disorders and neurological diseases, in particular with post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction to cannabis, cocaine, recurrent and bipolar affective disorders, behavioral disorders, which is the biological basis of its clinical polymorbidity. Symptoms of ADHD overlap with other clinical manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders (symptoms of autistic spectrum disorders, speech disorders, movement disorders, dyslexia, cognitive impairment), forming a polymorphic spectrum of pervasive developmental variants. Psychostimulants have been the standard of ADHD treatment for over 50 years. In 2002, atomoxetine became the first nonstimulant medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ADHD, first in children and later in adult patients. Stimulant and nonstimulant medications have been shown to be effective in different phenotypes of ADHD (comorbidity with other mental and neurological disorders). In case of comorbidity of ADHD with anxiety, tics, atomoxetine has an advantage over stimulants and, together with alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonists, can be recommended as the first drug. The presence of comorbid anxiety disorder or recurrent depression does not impact the efficacy and side effects of atomoxetine. Thus, atomoxetine is an effective drug and not only improves the symptoms of ADHD, but also plays a certain role in the treatment of patients with comorbid depression and anxiety.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN La aparición de síntomas psicóticos es una de las complicaciones más frecuentes producidas por el consumo agudo o crónico de cocaína, apareciendo hasta en el 65-70% de los consumidores. El síndrome de Ekbom se ha relacionado con múltiples causas, entre ellas el consumo de estimulantes y con la abstinencia al alcohol. El paciente tiene la convicción delirante monotemática de estar infectado por parásitos, lo cual puede acompañarse de otras manifestaciones como alteraciones sensoperceptivas. OBJETIVOS Analizar el papel de la cocaína en la aparición del síndrome de Ekbom. MATERIAL Y MÉTODO Descripción de un caso clínico y su revisión bibliográfica. Varón de 56 años, sin antecedentes en Salud Mental. Ex consumidor de cannabis y cocaína. Como antecedentes somáticos presenta infección por VHC curada y VIH. Recae en el consumo de cocaína tras fallecimiento de un familiar en Enero 2022, siendo derivado a la Unidad de Hospitalización en Junio 2022 por convicción delirante paranoide y actividad alucinatoria. En la exploración psicopatológica el paciente presenta delirios de infestación y zoopsias. En la exploración física observamos escoriaciones y cicatrices que se corresponden con rascado. Sin embargo, en el examen clínico no se encuentran alteraciones que justifiquen estas lesiones. Al ingreso comienza con Olanzapina 10mg desapareciendo la sintomatología en un par de días. CONCLUSIONES Es necesario hacer un correcto diagnóstico diferencial, mediante un examen clínico exhaustivo, el cual, en este caso, no pone de manifiesto ninguna patología física que justifique el cuadro, a pesar de lo cual el paciente presenta absoluta convicción. La idea delirante se ha relacionado con el aumento de los niveles de dopamina en los ganglios basales por el bloqueo del transportador de dopamina que producen los psicoestimulantes como la cocaína. De esta forma, es imprescindible el cese del consumo de tóxicos y un correcto tratamiento con neurolépticos.",

The case had taken 100 mg of zolpidem and afterwards, went into an unknown status of narcolepsy, faint, seizure or transient coma. Overdosing zolpidem and being affected by its central effects, he performed risky actions such as cooking by a gas oven and eating meal while intoxicated.

      "abstract": "Opioid use has been associated with induction of mania/hypomania. Such cases usually had past history of affective disorders. Tramadol has been most commonly found to be the causative factor, with only two cases where codeine was implicated. However, there is limited literature on opioid induced mania in patients with anxiety disorder. We present the case of a 54-year-old man with past history of alcohol and tobacco dependence syndrome. He consumed codeine containing cough syrup as a self-medication for panic disorder. Subsequently, he had a manic episode, although he had no past or family history of bipolar disorder. He was treated with olanzapine and withdrawal of codeine, which resulted in rapid improvement in manic symptoms. Understanding and differentiating substance-induced mood disorder from independent mood disorders is crucial. Similar to mood disorders, past history of anxiety disorders may also predict increased risk of opioid induced mania. Hence, past history of mood or anxiety disorders should be enquired before prescribing medications containing opioids and risk of self-medication with opioids should be explained to users.",

      "title": "Renal dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome: a potential contributor on developmental disabilities of offspring.",
      "abstract": "The term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) signifies the triad of intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly and short palpebral fissures, due to prenatal exposure to alcohol (1-4). Those severely affected have unusual facial dysmorphism with microcephaly, narrow forehead, short palpebral fissures with hypoplastic upper lip (5-7). In addition, they have developmental delay, behavior dysfunction or deficit, intellectual impairment and/or mental retardation (8,9). The term fetal alcohol effects (FAE) describe less extreme changes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Criteria have not yet been established for the diagnosis of FAE, but there is consensus that the diagnosis requires deficiencies in two of the above categories and a history of maternal alcohol abuse (1-4). \r\n\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure has also been linked to cardiac anomalies, urinary and kidney anomalies, neural tube defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, gastrointestinal and genital abnormalities, dental anomalies, limb and joint abnormalities, scoliosis, ptosis, strabismus, epicanthal folds, microphthalmia, myopia, short up-turned nose, broad or low nasal bridge, low set ears and rotated ears (10-12). \r\n\r\nRenal structural anomalies of FAS include cross-fused ectopia, renal hypoplasia and urethropelvic junction obstruction have been reported in children with FAS (10,12). More recent clinical and experimental studies have also shown that fetuses exposed to ethanol perinatally have a number of renal functional abnormalities, including impairment in renal acidification and potassium excretion as well as a defect in urinary concentrating ability, even in the absence of any structural abnormalities (13-15). The scanning electron microscopy examinations of the rat kidney following fetal exposure to alcohol, showed mitochondrial swelling and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the epithelial cells of the distal nephron, suggesting the possibility of alcohol induced renal tubular cell injury (16). Assadi and Ziai also reported that offspring of alcoholic mothers particularly those children with FAS have lower plasma zinc levels and that the urinary excretion of zinc is increased in these infants, suggesting a direct relationship between urinary losses and lower plasma zinc levels (17). \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that approximately 5% of all congenital birth defects are attributable to prenatal alcohol exposure across the globe (18-20). Estimates for the incidence of full-blown FAS, is 8 for every 1,000 live births, while that for FAE range from 10-30 per 1,000 live births (18-20). It is estimated that 110,000 newborns annually are affected by alcohol. Cost estimates for FAS/FAE are exorbitant. It is also estimated that 12% of the annual cost for all institutional care for the mentally retarded patients, in the Western communities, are for individuals with FAS/FAE (21). \r\n\r\nDespite the wide spread incidence, FAS remains to be difficult to diagnose clinically, and difficult to research. The clinical features may not be readily obvious and individually are not specific to only FAS (6,9,22). The neonatal period is the most difficult to diagnose FAS. In the neonate the facial dysmorphic feature is subtle, often obscured by periorbital or general facial edema. Mental retardation and developmental impairment may not be evident for several years. Throughout gross specific clinical features can vary. No single feature is found in every case. Also, there exists some overlap between FAS and other syndromes. A history of alcohol abuse in pregnancy is often under reported or denied. Physicians tend to under diagnose FAS either due to lack of familiarity with the syndrome or a reluctance to place a label with negative social connotations. \r\n\r\nThe most distressing consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure is the central nervous system damage (7,8). The affected newborn may exhibit poor sucking, tremulousness, unusual body posturing, abnormal reflexes, and disturbed sleep patterns. The older infant demonstrates measurable decrements in mental and motor development, poor visual recognition, memory and decreased expressive and receptive language. Affected preschoolers demonstrate decreased IQ scores, attention deficits, delayed reaction time and decrements in fine and gross motor performance. The school aged child has decreased achievement scores, is easily distracted, learning disabled, shows poor organization and cooperation and has a rigid approach to problem-solving (7,8). Adolescents and adults with FAS have an average IQ of 65 with a range from 20 to 90. Those with FAE have an average IQ of 80, ranging from 40 to 100 (1-6). Despite higher IQ scores, individuals with FAE generally have achievement test scores similar to those with full FAS. In general, more physical manifestations are associated with poorer intelligence. However, there is a wide overlap in the ranges and the degree of brain damage is not always directly proportional to the severity of physical malformations, making it difficult to predict intelligence on an individual basis. Adolescents and adults exhibit a wide variety of behavioral problems, including impulsivity, social withdrawal and anxiety. Most have problems in adaptive living, lacking judgment and problem-solving skills. Few adults with FAS or FAE are self-sufficient. \r\n\r\nThe identification of renal dysfunction and zinc deficiency in FAS is important from a prognostic point of view and to permit adequate and comprehensive management of patients with this syndrome. \r\n\r\nPrevious studies have shown that birth defects that result from prenatal zinc deficiency are likely caused by a defect in DNA and protein synthesis (23-25). It is also known that zinc deficiency can lower the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in multiple organs of alcoholic patients (26). \r\n\r\nBecause zinc plays an important role in DNA synthesis and current data are inconclusive, it is possible that alcohol-induced zinc deficiency may contribute to alcohol related birth defects observed in FAS (17). This possibility remains a reasonable hypothesis and requires further study. \r\n\r\nAlcohol induced organ damage arises not only from the direct effects of alcohol on tissues but also from the metabolism and the metabolites of alcohol. Recent investigations have focused on assessing the direct effect of alcohol versus acetaldehyde toxicity, the role of nutrition with impaired placental function and synergic effects of nicotine and caffeine (26). More specifically, mechanisms for FAS involving altered protein synthesis and hypoxemia have been considered (26). Class I and Class II alcohol dehydrogenases are the enzymes that are primarily responsible for initial degradation of alcohol, acetaldehyde, in humans. It has been found that acetaldehyde can cross the human placenta from the maternal to the fetal compartments. Toxic aldehydes generated in this initial degradation step are further oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenases. It seems likely that genetic variation in alcohol metabolism may lead to differences in the propensity of individuals to develop alcohol induced organ damage. With DNA probes, it will now be possible to assess the role of alcohol metabolizing enzymes in the development of organ damage. \r\n\r\nAs to a specific mechanism by which alcohol may impair fetal growth and development, impaired protein synthesis, abnormal delivery or regulation of glucose in the fetus, altered zinc metabolism, and hypoxia are key considerations under investigation. Better understanding of the mechanism involved may permit more meaningful therapeutic intervention. \r\n\r\nThe timing of alcoholic exposure is also crucial (22). The most crucial period for anatomic abnormalities is early in the first trimester, which includes the time segment preceding pregnancy recognition. The third trimester appears to be the most vulnerable period for overall gross and central nervous system development. Intrauterine growth retardation cannot be detected by ultrasonography until approximately 27 weeks gestation. \r\n\r\nFAS/FAE is particularly tragic because it is totally preventable, simply through abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. It is the responsibility of health care professionals, social and government agencies to protect the unborn child from the devastating effects of alcohol. The most effective weapon for prevention of FAS is education which targets every non-pregnant of childbearing age (27,28). Pregnant women who are identified to use alcohol should be intensively counseled to discontinue further alcohol consumption. Although this will not reverse any damage already produced, at least any further damage is prevented. \r\n\r\nIdentification of women at risk is often difficult. Simple questioning can be unreliable because of poor recall or denial. Since direct questioning regarding alcohol can be intimidating, questionnaires may be developed for assessment of risk. Hopefully through continued educational efforts, we will successfully imprint the awareness that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is unacceptable.",

      "title": "Review of Opioid-Associated Hearing Loss and Possible Mechanism of Opioid-Mediated Endothelin-1-Dependent",
      "abstract": "Within the past several decades, there have been multiple reports of profound sensorineural hearing loss attributed to opioid use. Among the implicated opioids are both prescription analgesics used within their recommended dosages such as codeine, hydrocodone/ acetaminophen, and oxycodone/acetaminophen, as well as illicit substances such as heroin. Opioid-associated hearing loss has lead to both reversible and irreversible profound bilateral hearing loss, and the mechanism by which this occurs is currently unknown. Audiometry, otoacoustic emission, and auditory brainstem responses suggest that the lesion is cochlear in origin, as does the finding that patients with irreversible loss respond well to cochlear implantation. A plausible mechanism for this loss is opioid-induced vasoconstriction causing cochlear ischemia and subsequent hearing loss. Opioid receptors have been found in the inner ear in various animal models, and opioids are well-known to promote diminished blood flow, ischemia, and infarction. Opioids are also known to increase the production of and stimulate the release of endothelin-1, which is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor that is found throughout the body as well as in the inner ear. In this review, we summarize the reports of opioid-associated hearing loss and propose that this hearing loss is mediated by vasoconstriction and cochlear ischemia via opioid-mediated stimulation of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1.",

      "abstract": "The network therapy approach can be useful in addressing a broad range of patients with addictions characterized by the following clinical hallmarks of substance use disorder: First, when they initiate consumption of their addictive agent, be it alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or depressant drugs, they frequently cannot limit that consumption to a reasonable and predictable level; this phenomenon has been termed \"loss of control\" by clinicians who treat persons dependent on alcohol or drugs. Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age.

Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Emotional Intelligence in Female Children with PTSD After Sexual AbuseC hild abuse is a repeatable early life trauma that is dif- ficult to identify and is one of the strongest risk factors for later emotional psychopathology.Children and adolescents who have a history of childhood abuse have a low level of health-related quality of life, [1] and tend to be more prone to delinquency, posttraumatic stress disorder, and dissociation than those who have not. [2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them. These “minor” events can still progress to more significant harm.",

      "title": "Isn’t it Time to Use Opioid Drugs in Emergency Medical Services?",
      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant feeling and experience that is caused by a potential or practical injury and its control is so important that the American Pain Society has introduced pain as the 5 th vital sign for emphasizing the importance of pain and controlling it. Almost all humans have experienced moderate to severe pain and most of the time the experience has happened following surgical procedures, medical conditions or trauma. When pain manifests in a clinical condition, health care staff are responsible for following it and relieving it as a goal and responsibility. Pain affects all individuals regardless of age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status and untreated pain can negatively affect various systems of the body and lead to many consequences. Increase in serum level of cortisol, nor epinephrine, and renin angiotension, hyperglycemia, decrease in insulin, manifestation of anxiety, cardiac effects such as ischemia, dysrhythmia, increase in pulse, increase in cardiac load, increased oxygen uptake, increased blood coagulation potential, hypertension especially in patients with head injuries, decreased blood oxygen level, increased body fluid volume, drop in blood potassium, fatigue, muscle cramps, decreased immune system function, decreased ability for wound healing and etc. are among the undesirable side effects of pain. In addition, not treating acute pains also leads to bearing unnecessary pain, elongated duration of hospitalization, increased medical costs and probability of acute pain progressing and developing into chronic pain. The financial burden of not treating pain in America has been estimated to be about 100 billion dollars per year. Pain is a common complaint and makes up a considerable portion of reasons that patients call pre-hospital emergency services and is usually present in the injured and trauma patients. Study results showed that 20% to 31% of the patients presenting via ambulances had moderate and severe pain. Additionally, with 52% to 86% prevalence in emergencies, pain is a key topic in health care of various countries. Pre-hospital emergency staff members are the first in line among health care staff that face patients at times of disaster and accident and are more exposed to the patients’ pain. Despite the quantitative growth of pre-hospital emergency bases to 1900 bases throughout Iran, observations of researchers and evidence and instructions of emergency medical services (EMS) of Iran are indicative of not using enough analgesic drugs, especially opioid analgesic drugs, as a means to relieve patients’ pain in EMS ambulances. Some studies have mentioned that about one third of the pre-hospital patients and more than 80% of patients with bone fractures report moderate to severe pain and on the other hand the positive effect of using pain killers in the regions that used them have been shown to be obvious in most patients. It seems that using analgesics in EMS is a very important topic and researchers express that proper pain management is an important principle in pre-hospital care and opioid analgesics such as morphine and fentanyl have a special place in the instructions of EMS as treatments for acute trauma and non-trauma pains, especially cardiac chest pains, in some advanced countries regarding emergency care. Considering the afore-mentioned points concerning the importance of pain and its treatment, especially the importance of treating pain in traumatic and ischemic cardiac diseases, high prevalence of pain in pre-hospital missions, severity and type of pre-hospital missions, which are mostly associated with pain, high costs of not treating pain and the obvious need for using pain killers in trauma and ischemic cardiac diseases, isn’t it time to introduce a more effective and scientific approach in EMS? Isn’t it better to add a few types of analgesics and opioid drugs to the equipment provided at patients’ bedside, at least for ischemic cardiac diseases and severe trauma? Although the result of a study carried out in Khuzestan province showed that EMS staff members were weak regarding drug information and calculations and other studies have also expressed that drug dosage and use of opioid drugs might not be done correctly or opioid drugs might be abused in some cases, none are convincing reasons for not using these drugs. These problems could be solved by more and better training for EMS staff, creating offline and online protocols and useful programs for preventing abuse of analgesic drugs and these drugs could be effectively used in EMS. Therefore, we again note that this treatment priority should not be overlooked for any reason.",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractWithdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic pain is pain that persists past the normal time of healing, and is seen as a common problem with a significant socioeconomic impact. Pharmacological management for chronic non-cancer pain also involves the prescription of opioids, with the aim of an improved quality of life for the patient. New guidelines have been published to aid prescribing clinicians improve opioid safety and patient care, and include recommendations on when to refer patients to a pain specialist. In recent years there has been a rapid increase in opioid prescription in the UK and USA, prompting further concern regarding opioid abuse and side effects. Opioid use may also result in physical dependence and tolerance. Earlier recognition and diagnosis of unwanted effects of long term opioid use is needed, such as opioid induced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, and opioid induced immunosuppression. Patients may themselves discontinue opioids, however, due to minor side effects. Recent advances in opioid prescription include the increasing use of transdermal preparations and extended release, oral, once daily preparations. New formulations of existing drugs have been developed, as well as a new chemical entity. Abuse deterrent formulations and delivery systems may prevent the artificial acceleration of drug delivery and reduce the potential for opioid addiction. Overdose concerns and the potential for fatal overdose may necessitate mandatory training for all clinicians who prescribe opioids. Despite the widespread use of opioids in the management of chronic non-cancer pain, significant research gaps remain. An improvement in the evidence base for its prescription is required.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

      "abstract": "Pituitary tumour apoplexy (PA) is a rare clinical syndrome that occurs as a result of acute haemorrhage and/or infarction within a frequently undiagnosed pituitary tumour. The sudden enlargement of the pituitary mass undergoing PA is responsible for a wide range of acute symptoms/signs (severe headache, visual loss, diplopia, hypopituitarism, impaired consciousness) which, together with the radiological evidence of a pituitary lesion, establish the diagnosis. The optimal care of PA requires involvement of a multidisciplinary team including endocrinologist, neurosurgeon, neuroophthalmologist and the management strategy that depends on the clinical manifestations, as well as the presence of co-morbidities. Prompt surgical decompression is initially indicated in cases with severe or progressive impairment of the visual acuity or the visual fields or with altered mental state and leads to visual and neurological recovery in most of the patients. The patients with mild, stable clinical picture (including those with isolated ocular palsies) can be managed conservatively (support offluid and electrolyte balance and stress doses of steroids in most cases) with favourable visual and neurological outcome. Frequent reassessment is mandatory because the clinical course can be unpredictable; if progression of symptoms occurs, later elective surgery is indicated and is beneficial, especially in terms of visual outcome. The endocrinological outcome is less favourable, irrespective of the treatment option, with many patients remaining on long-term replacement therapy. Despite the above guidelines, clear proof of optimal outcomes in the form of randomised controlled trials is lacking. Regrowth of the pituitary tumour years after a PA episode is possible and patients require long-term surveillance.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

This definition is derived initially from behavioral models of learning, and in the field of addiction, most work with sensitization refers to the progressive increase in the motor stimulant effect of amphetamine-like psychostimulants that is elicited by repeated drug administration (2,3). Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorders are cyclical mood disorders with clinical features including distinct sustained periods of mood elevation. Briefer (4 days or more), mild episodes of mood elevation define bipolar II disorder; lengthier (7 days or more), more severe episodes (or those requiring hospitalisation), with or without psychotic features, define bipolar I disorder. Depressive periods are more common and lengthier than manic or hypomanic states, and are the main cause of disability. Bipolar depression may respond poorly to antidepressants and these medications may destabilise the illness. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be considered when a patient with depression is treatment resistant. Irritability is a common symptom in bipolar disorder, particularly during mixed states (during which patients have features of mood elevation and depression concurrently) or when there is rapid cycling of mood (more than four episodes of mood disorder per year). Alcohol misuse and use of illicit drugs may simulate mood changes in bipolar disorder. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of bipolar disorder is essential for clinical decision making and determining prognosis and treatments.",

      "title": "Cocaine Addiction as a Neurological Disorder: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinical and preclinical studies provide convincing evidence for persistent neurological/psychiatric impairments and possible neuronal degeneration associated with chronic cocaine/stimulant abuse. These impairments include multifocal and global cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhages, infarctions, optic neuropathy, cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairments, and mood and movement disorders. These findings may encourage the placement of stimulant addiction into the category of organic brain disorders. Functional and microanatomical anomalies in the frontal and temporal cortex as well as other brain regions may be responsible for certain aspects of phenomenology and neuropsychopathology that are characteristic of stimulant polydrug addictions. These may include broad spectrum of deficits in cognition, motivation, and insight; behavioral disinhibition; attention deficits; emotional instability; impulsiveness; aggressiveness; depression; anhedonia; and persistent movement disorders. Although it is still debated whether the hypofrontality and other brain anomalies observed in stimulant abusers are a consequence or an antecedent of drug abuse, this debate seems purely academic and irrelevant with respect to the importance of compensating for these deficits in the development of treatment strategies. The neuropsychiatric impairments accompanying stimulant abuse may contribute to the very high rate of relapse in addicts that can take place after long periods (years) of abstinence. It is possible that the neurological deficits present in stimulant addicts, whether they are primary or secondary to stimulant abuse, are responsible for perpetual drug abuse which may be a form of self-medication (Weiss et al. 1991, 1992). In this context, addiction to stimulants, once fully developed, may represent a true biological dependency on drugs that temporarily compensate for existing neurological deficits. The concept of self-medication by drug addicts is supported by major theories of biological psychiatry. While a majority of drug addicts are polydrug users, there seems to be a preference for a particular type of drug among different populations of addicts. Addicts who experience distress, anxious dysphoria, and turbulent anger prefer the calming actions of opiates, whereas addicts with preceding attention deficit disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder often prefer stimulants (Khantzian 1985). Figure 1 presents conceptual relationships between brain damage and cocaine/stimulant abuse. More clinical studies are needed to establish unequivocally the epidemiological relationships between preexisting neurological deficits-resulting either from genetic, developmental, traumatic, or neurotoxic factors- and vulnerability to drug addictions. Nonetheless, deducing from the results of preclinical studies, it is conceivable that individuals with neurological deficits associated with attention deficit disorder, developmental neuroanatomical abnormalities, lead poisoning, alcoholism, posttraumatic brain lesions, and PTSD may be more vulnerable to stimulant addiction. This notion has significant empirical support as preclinical studies have shown that animals with lesioned prefrontal cortex became supersensitive to cocaine (Schenk et al. 1991) and animals with lesions at the amygdala, VTA, or raphe nuclei manifest more rapid acquisition of amphetamine self-administration than control rats (Deminiere et al. 1989). The above arguments, postulating neuropathology as an intrinsic component of stimulant addiction, should be taken into consideration with the caveat that the clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogenous and addicts may express varying stages and degrees of the disease as determined by environmental and genetic factors. Therefore, it is likely that stimulant addicts who have less advanced neuropathology may recover spontaneously after detoxification with proper nutritional and psychotherapeutic support if they can sustain abstinence.

      "title": "Presenting Symptoms of Pituitary Apoplexy",
      "abstract": "Abstract The classical term “pituitary apoplexy” (PA) describes a clinical syndrome usually characterized by abrupt onset of headache accompanied by neurologic and/or endocrinologic deterioration due to sudden expansion of a mass within the sella turcica as a result of hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumor and adjacent pituitary gland. PA is a medical emergency and a difficult diagnosis to establish. Thus this article reviews the presenting symptoms of PA patients to help clinicians recognize or at least suspect this critical condition early on. PA commonly occurs in the setting of a preexisting adenoma, and several patients are unaware of its existence prior to the onset of apoplexy symptoms, which are mainly of a neurologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrinologic nature. Neurologic symptoms include sudden-onset severe headache and other symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, symptoms from compression of the cavernous sinus contents, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, and symptoms of meningeal irritation. Ophthalmologic symptoms include visual field defects, visual loss, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia. Endocrinologic disturbances include pituitary adenoma symptoms, cortisol deficiency, panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging method of choice to aid the PA diagnosis. Its differential diagnoses include cerebrovascular accidents, infectious diseases, and other causes of endocrinologic imbalance. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice, especially if there are associated visual abnormalities and ophthalmoplegia. Clinicians should be aware of the presenting symptoms because early diagnosis may reduce the morbidity and mortality of this neurosurgical emergency.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may mimic other minor and major psychiatric disorders or symptoms. Psychomotor disturbances may also be seen in OCD. Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

The doses of opioids should always be reduced gradually, even when other treatment options give good pain relief. Patients receiving long-term treatment with opioids become more sensitive to the opioid antagonist naloxone. Inappropriate use of naloxone in these patients can also result in acute abstinence symptoms. Opioid treatment is limited by toxic side effects, and the problem can be solved by changing the opioid. The author describes three cases to illustrate these problems.",

MDMA is taken because it gives a feeling of euphoria, enhances energy and sociability, and heightens sensations and sexual arousal. However, several side effects have been described: headache, nausea, anorexia, xerostomia, insomnia, myalgia, trismus, and bruxism (). More serious complications have also been reported, sometimes even leading to death: hyperthermia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, liver failure, and water intoxication ().

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "abstract": "Among well-known side effects such as dizziness, nausea, headache and diplopia medical treatment of epilepsy may cause side effects on cognition, mood and behavior. In special constellations this can profoundly affect compliance with the medication as well as quality of life. Some patients are more vulnerable to side effects than others. Side effects can have profound impact on the development and future life of a patient. Some antiepileptic drugs (e.g. topiramate, zonisamide) show a more severe side effect profile than others (e.g. lamotrigine, levetiracetam). Thus, in the treatment of epilepsy, it is crucial to consider such possible side effects – especially in the beginning of or while changing the medical treatment. Specific neuropsychological examinations can monitor side effects on cognitive functions like concentration, memory or speech function. If this is not possible in an ambulant setting, specific screening instruments and repeated and precise interviews of patients and/or relatives can help to discover potential side effects. Because most side effects can be reversible, dosage modification or drug replacement is required as soon as incompatibilities are discovered.",

Because of their widespread prescription and the continued social use of alcohol, it is necessary to test for interaction between these agents. Drug-induced atropine-like effects in humans (including dry mouth, constipation and paralytic ileus) are described and related to animal experiments. Radiological investigations in mice indicate that alcohol delays the passage of barium along the gut, and this effect is enhanced by psychotropic drugs. Related drug interactions may result in prolonged or delayed adverse reactions. Late (delayed) deaths, recently recorded in humans and animals, may be associated with the inhibition of gastro-intestinal motility by ethical psychotropic agents, particularly when taken together with alcohol. Patients given these drugs should in general be warned against the concurrent use of alcohol.",

The nosology of anxiety.Anxiety is phenomenologically defined as a state experienced as fear or tension dependent on whether psychic or somatic manifestations prevail. Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

All symptoms disappeared without treatment after 3 days.

      "abstract": "Abuse of alcohol (ethanol) and abuse of an increasing number of drugs (e.g. analgesics and sedatives) are among the outstanding social and medical problems of many industrialized countries including Switzerland. Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice the most important of these interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the \"metabolic\" and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The mechanisms and practical consequences of the clinically most important influences of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of drugs are outlined.",

It is a normal state and a spur to action, but readily exceeds normal limits in intensity, duration and appropriateness to the stimulus or situation. Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico. Conclusiones. el consumo de PBC se cine a patrones de conducta muy variables pero siempre condicionadas a estimulos internos y externos, con poca o ninguna relacion con la euforia, sugiriendo un fenomeno asociado a la neurobiologia del aprendizaje",

This paradoxical effect may be mechanistically related to tolerance induced by increasing doses of opioids. Two case reports illustrate a syndrome characterized by increasing pain pursued by escalating opioid doses, which results in a worsening of the clinical picture. Several experimental data may help explain the course of this challenging clinical condition. In escalating opioid doses rapidly, a risk of opioid‐induced hyperalgesia should be recognized, as higher doses of opioids may stimulate rather than inhibit the central nervous system by different mechanisms. Alternative procedures should be taken into consideration to break this cycle, should it occur. More data are needed to detect this condition, as currently no diagnostic information on specific markers, clinical or biochemical, exists.",

The peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) after a single amount of alcohol is reached 30-45 minutes after ingestion, depending on the rate of absorption and whether food has been taken. Alcohol is a pharmacological intoxicant that suppresses the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. Alcohol interferes with the ability to form new memories, particularly when it is taken in intoxicating amounts. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of neurotransmission in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new memories. A common consequence of clinically significant alcohol intoxication is memory loss for events that occurred while the person was intoxicated—a form of anterograde amnesia.",

      "title": "From OFF to ON—Treating OFF Episodes in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "In Parkinson’s disease (PD), OFF episodes continue to present a serious burden for patients, and their effective management remains a substantial unmet clinical need. Understanding of the pathophysiology of OFF episodes has advanced in recent years, providing valuable insights for improved treatments. OFF episodes generally appear 3–5 years after starting levodopa treatment, but can begin much earlier. They are characterized by motor symptoms (including tremor, rigidity, slowness, incoordination, and weakness) and are almost always associated with some non-motor symptoms (including psychological symptoms, pain, urinary problems, swallowing difficulties, and shortness of breath). In PD, higher doses of levodopa are associated with increased risk of motor and non-motor complications, which are notable limitations for longterm therapy. Their occurrence is associated with intermittent levodopa delivery and consequent fluctuating plasma levels. These issues can be offset using lower levodopa doses where possible, incremental dose increases, and combinations of levodopa with other pharmacological agents. OFF episodes in PD can be caused by gastroparesis and/or by Helicobacter pylori infection, which delays delivery of levodopa. These issues can be addressed using new formulations for continuous intrajejunal administration. In addition, pen injector, intranasal, and inhaled dosing systems have been studied and may provide relief via non-intestinal routes. Other approaches include deep-brain stimulation, which is effective but is restricted by costs and potential adverse events. This report presents the highlights of a satellite symposium held at the 14th International Conference on Alzheimer’s &amp; Parkinson’s Diseases (AD/PD™ 2019), Lisbon, Portugal, which discussed the nature of OFF episodes in PD, associated risk factors and the potential of current and future treatments to effectively manage them and increase ON time.",

      "abstract": "Alcoholic excess is associated with epilepsy in two different ways, as cause or as an effect of it. In the first instance, intemperance may appear as a hurtful habit of the individual favouring the development of the spasmodic neurosis, or again, as a constitutional tendency entailed by parent on offspring with similar dreadful consequences. In the second instance, the moral perversion ordinarily wrought by their disease on the character and conduct of several epileptics, drives them to vicious indulgence in drinking, which aggravates and changes the original character of their fits. The majority of writers have not distinguished in estimating the relationship of intemperance to epilepsy, or insanity, the number of cases immediately ascribable to vice from those in which the uncontrollable passion, or craving for drink, is, as it also happens with masturbation, merely the sign of the outbreak of an inherited predisposition to insanity, or epilepsy, or of the early stages in the evolution of either of these maladies as consequence of accidental causes.

      "abstract": "Alcoholic excess is associated with epilepsy in two different ways, as cause or as an effect of it. In the first instance, intemperance may appear as a hurtful habit of the individual favouring the development of the spasmodic neurosis, or again, as a constitutional tendency entailed by parent on offspring with similar dreadful consequences. In the second instance, the moral perversion ordinarily wrought by their disease on the character and conduct of several epileptics, drives them to vicious indulgence in drinking, which aggravates and changes the original character of their fits. The majority of writers have not distinguished in estimating the relationship of intemperance to epilepsy, or insanity, the number of cases immediately ascribable to vice from those in which the uncontrollable passion, or craving for drink, is, as it also happens with masturbation, merely the sign of the outbreak of an inherited predisposition to insanity, or epilepsy, or of the early stages in the evolution of either of these maladies as consequence of accidental causes. Nor has the influence which traumatic injuries to the head, syphilis, or other derangements possibly coincident with the abuse of alcoholics, by themselves exert, been taken into proper account in calculating the part of the latter in the spread, on a wide and increasing scale, of mental and nervous affections.

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

      "abstract": "In de afgelopen decennia is het gebruik van ADHD medicatie, met name stimulantia, toegenomen. Deze toename leidt regelmatig tot verhit maatschappelijk debat en onrust onder ouders en clinici. De zorgen over ADHD medicatie worden in de media aangewakkerd door suggestieve berichtgeving over de overeenkomsten met harddrugs als cocaine en ecstasy. Terecht vraagt men zich af: willen we onze kinderen blootstellen aan een middel waarvan we het lange-termijn effect op de hersenontwikkeling niet kennen? In dit proefschrift presenteer ik de resultaten van onderzoek naar de lange-termijn effecten van ADHD medicatie op het zich ontwikkelende brein. Vaker dan wel, vinden we geen verband tussen medicatie en de ontwikkeling van het brein. Zo vinden we geen effect van ADHD medicatie op de dikte van de cortex (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat dunner), op het volume van de frontaalschors (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat kleiner), of op activatie in het striatum tijdens beloning (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat verhoogd). Ook wat betreft ADHD symptomen, sociaal-emotioneel functioneren en cognitie vinden we geen lange-termijn effect, positief dan wel negatief, van medicatie. In een aantal studies vinden we echter wel subtiele veranderingen in het brein na behandeling met stimulantia. De frontaalschors, bijvoorbeeld, is kleiner bij jongeren met ADHD, maar niet bij jongeren met ADHD die drager zijn van het DRD4 7R allel en bovendien op jonge leeftijd medicatie hebben gekregen. Ook vinden we dat jongeren die intensief zijn behandeld met stimulantia, wanneer ze een beloning krijgen, een hersengebied activeren dat belangrijk is voor cognitieve controle; jongeren met ADHD die niet zo intensief zijn behandeld activeren dit gebied niet. We denken dat deze extra activatie positief kan zijn voor de jongeren, en er bijvoorbeeld aan kan bijdragen dat intensief behandelde jongeren minder kans hebben om verslaafd raken. Samenvattend: vaker dan wel vinden we geen effect van medicatie op het brein. De effecten die we wel vinden zijn subtiel, soms specifiek voor een bepaalde subgroep van kinderen/jongeren met ADHD, en lijken eerder een positief dan een negatief karakter te hebben.",

      "abstract": "A pregnant woman who happens on a continuous exposure to various therapeutic agents during her gestation period may give birth to a neonate suffering from Neonatal Syndrome. The most common cause of NAS are opioids such as heroin, codeine and morphine and is commonly termed as opioid withdrawal syndrome but also other legally or illegally sold substances over the counter can contribute to this syndrome. Infants also develop some kind of addition in the womb when exposed to some antidepressants such as barbiturates and benzodiazepine. There are two kinds of NAS that exist, prenatal NAS which is as a result of the termination of medication being used with a pregnant mother and postnatal NAS which occurs as a result of the termination of drugs directly to the infant. The most frequently occurring syndrome consists of tremor, insomnia, perspiration, Common syndrome according to the frequency includes tremor, high-pitched sneezing sound, increased muscle tone, regurgitation and emesis, loose stools, s, excoriation, mottling, nasal congestion low-grade fever, and tachypnea. Opioid withdrawal symptoms can be a reflection of other symptoms of other conditions in a new-born, such as infections, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypothyroidism, and brain complications (eg., cerebral palsy). The need and time frame of treatment is reduced by breastfeeding. All NAS babies need to be followed up regularly. Not all infants will require treatment with pharmacotherapy, but all should receive non-pharmacologic interventions.

Biological markers of neuroprogression will be reviewed in the light of the staging model of addiction proposed by Volkow and Koob (intoxication, withdrawal and negative affect, and preoccupation and anticipation) and of allostatic load theory. Chronic exposure to drugs leads to allostatic load or overload through these stages. Neuroadaptation in this process disrupts brain morphology and function. Evidence regarding neuroprogression in drug addiction will focus on neuroimaging findings as well as neurotrophins, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress, and accelerated ageing.",

      "abstract": "Antidepressants are pharmacos high utilizated in medical pratic due to their several prescriptions, such as depressive diagnostics, anxious phobic disorder, among other things. Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "Objective: To report a case of delirium involving a drug interaction of the antidepressant phenelzine in combination with an opiate and to discuss the exacerbation of delirium secondary to a withdrawal syndrome caused by the abrupt discontinuation of phenelzine. Case Summary: A 67-year-old white woman with a history of major depression and chronic anxiety developed delirium shortly after the postsurgical administration of opioid analgesics. In addition, she was taking the antidepressant phenelzine and had been maintained on this medication for approximately 20 years. Her presenting symptoms included combativeness, auditory and visual hallucinations, and persecutory delusions. After development of the delirium, the patient's phenelzine medication was abruptly discontinued, introducing a withdrawal syndrome that further aggravated her condition. Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of the potentially fatal drug interaction involving phenelzine and opiates and addresses the adverse consequences of abruptly discontinuing phenelzine during phenelzine–opiate–induced delirium. Phenelzine–opiate interactions and phenelzine withdrawal should be considered as possible etiologies of delirium in patients with a history of phenelzine use. Conclusions: Less widely prescribed antidepressants such as phenelzine may be unfamiliar to contemporary clinicians, resulting in adverse consequences for patients, such as phenelzine–opiate drug interactions and phenelzine withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

The characteristic features of anticholinergic intoxication are the rapid onset of alterations in mood, cognition and perception in the presence of a clear sensorium and following the ingestion of the drug in a commonly distributable form. But if psychotic symptoms are present in the absence of retained reality testing a diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder may be warranted. Therefore, in same cases clinical picture presents a differential diagnostic dilemma.Method:The authors present the case report of twenty-one year old male with dependence of multiple drug use (according the criteria of ICD-X), who was observed in department of alcoholism. In early adolescence period he used different psychoactive substances (opioids and non-opioid psychoactive substances). At last two years he episodically consumed anticholinergics. Upon the mixed use of alcohol with anticholinergics he experienced auditory hallucinations, rapid and incoherent speech and paranoid ideation. He acted out his imperative hallucinations aggressively with violent behavior.During hospital treatment he was treated with antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines and supportive and educational therapies.Results:On this regiment psychotic symptoms resolved completely after two weeks.Conclusion:Results of complete psychiatric-psychological examination did not indicate psychotic disorder.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

The socalled \"opioid-induced constipation\" (OIC) can develop at the start of opioid therapy and can last as long as continued use. The OIC is a real change in intestinal habits that occurs when opioid treatment is started; it is noted with a reduced frequency of episodes of defecation, with a development or worsening of the effort to defecation, with a feeling of incomplete emptying and a perception on the part of the patient to live in a stressful way the act of defecation. Also because of this, the OIC can induce to tolerate the dose of opioids routinely causing inadequate pain management. Continuous therapy with opioids lasting at least two weeks and resistance to the treatment of constipation with osmotic laxatives for more than three days in patients with terminal disease (Nota 90 AIFA) allow the prescription of naloxegol, a PEGylated derivative of the naloxone. Naloxegol belongs to the PAMORA family (peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonists) which does not generally cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore does not interfere with the central nervous system-mediated analgesic efficacy. The reported clinical case tends to show how the use of the drug under examination (naloxegol) solves the problem of the OIC in a oncologic patient, improving her quality of life.",

El dolor neuropático a menudo incluye síntomas como una sensación quemante o punzante, la sensibilidad anormal a estímulos que normalmente no causan dolor o el aumento de la sensibilidad a estímulos dolorosos habituales. El dolor neuropático es un síntoma frecuente en muchas enfermedades del sistema nervioso. Los fármacos opiáceos, como la morfina, se usan comúnmente para el tratamiento del dolor neuropático. La mayoría de las revisiones han examinado todos los opiáceos juntos. Esta revisión buscó la evidencia específicamente para la morfina; otros opiáceos se consideran en revisiones separadas.",

      "title": "Hypoxia driven opioid targeted automated device for overdose rescue",
      "abstract": "Abstract Opioid use disorder has been designated a worsening epidemic with over 100,000 deaths due to opioid overdoses recorded in 2021 alone. Unintentional deaths due to opioid overdoses have continued to rise inexorably. While opioid overdose antidotes such as naloxone, and nalmefene are available, these must be administered within a critical time window to be effective. Unfortunately, opioid-overdoses may occur in the absence of antidote, or may be unwitnessed, and the rapid onset of cognitive impairment and unconsciousness, which frequently accompany an overdose may render self-administration of an antidote impossible. Thus, many lives are lost because: (1) an opioid overdose is not anticipated (i.e., monitored/detected), and (2) antidote is either not present, and/or not administered within the critical frame of effectiveness. Currently lacking is a non-invasive means of automatically detecting, reporting, and treating such overdoses. To address this problem, we have designed a wearable, on-demand system that comprises a safe, compact, non-invasive device which can monitor, and effectively deliver an antidote without human intervention, and report the opioid overdose event. A novel feature of our device is a needle-stow chamber that stores needles in a sterile state and inserts needles into tissue only when drug delivery is needed. The system uses a microcontroller which continuously monitors respiratory status as assessed by reflex pulse oximetry. When the oximeter detects the wearer’s percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen to be less than or equal to 90%, which is an indication of impending respiratory failure in otherwise healthy individuals, the microcontroller initiates a sequence of events that simultaneously results in the subcutaneous administration of opioid antidote, nalmefene, and transmission of a GPS-trackable 911 alert. The device is compact (4 × 3 × 3 cm), adhesively attaches to the skin, and can be conveniently worn on the arm. Furthermore, this device permits a centralized remotely accessible system for effective institutional, large-scale intervention. Most importantly, this device has the potential for saving lives that are currently being lost to an alarmingly increasing epidemic.",

Subclinical hepatic encephalopathy may manifest only on neuropsychological testing, with minimal slowing of mental processes and mild cognitive impairment. Moderately severe hepatic encephalopathy is associated with lethargy, apathy, and subtle changes in personality. This chapter presents the possible mental signs and symptoms, possible physical signs and symptoms, and clinical course and prognosis. It also describes the case of a 69-year-old patient who displayed the symptoms of chronic hepatic encephalopathy along with an unusual, delusional misidentification syndrome. When very mild hepatic encephalopathy is suspected, neuropsychological testing maybe extremely useful. Patients who are at risk for hepatic encephalopathy include: those with hepatitis (especially hepatitis C), individuals who have abused alcohol, have malignancies spread to the liver, toxic exposure, toxic drug reactions, or chronic liver disease of any other kind (Wilson's disease).",

This depots formulation having a cluster of adverse events characterized by post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS). Here, we present three cases of different age group, different gender suffering from Schizophrenia of varied duration of illness who developed PDSS after receiving OLAI, how they were identified and promptly managed with early intervention. PDSS noted in approximately 0.07% of the injections, in 1.3% of patients. Symptoms such as sedation, delirium, extrapyramidal symptoms, ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, aggression, and speech impairment were reported, onset was immediate to 3–5 h post-injection, patients recovered within 2–72 h. No such risk factors could be identified in any of the cases. PDSS following OLAI occurs when there is accidental intravascular release of high dose of olanzapine. The importance of post-injection syndrome in the above cases lies in the fact that following administration of OLAI a 3–4-h observation period in a health-care facility in the presence of an appropriate qualified personnel is of utmost importance. Furthermore, one should rule out other causes of acute sedation in such patients before establishing the diagnosis of PDSS. There is no specific antidote for olanzapine and almost all such patients improve with conservative and supportive treatment.",

Results Apomorphine is a dopaminergic agonist that acts directly on D2 receptors. It has been used in alcoholism, male sexual dysfunction and with diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Conclusions The present work describes the case of a woman with PD who developed a loss of control over the consumption of apomorphine that resulted in a significant impairment of her functioning. PD patients with high frequency develop different psychiatric symptoms. Conversely, anti‐Parkinsonian drugs also generate psychiatric symptoms that can be experienced by the patient as pleasant sensations (‘alerting’, ‘awakening’, ‘activating’, hypomania and hypersexuality). In spite of this, addiction to these drugs in patients with PD is a very rare phenomenon. Currently, the prescription of apomorphine has been extended to patients with erectile dysfunction, which may increase the prevalence of addiction cases or of severe psychiatric symptoms.",

The meaning of the symptom is essential: it may reveal a crisis related to his developmental phase, antecedent infantile disease or the offset of adult disease. Secondly, at this age, the prescription of drugs rises questions about pharmacokinetics, possible side-effects, expected therapeutic effects and the way the prescription is experienced psychologically. Neuroleptics, which may be necessary in spite of their side-effects, should be restricted to psychotic conditions. Antidepressants, lithium, tranquilizers are also discussed with respect to their usefulness, risks and indications.

Particular etiologies at risk for seizures include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury. The use of prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration remains controversial in many situations, with most of the larger studies having used older antiepileptic drugs prophylactically. If seizures do occur, patients are typically treated with parenteral antiepileptic drugs. The duration of treatment is unknown in most situations, but it should be individualized depending on acute and monophasic injury versus chronic process. Late seizures, which occur after the first 2 weeks from the insult, have a more ominous risk for subsequent epilepsy and should be treated for extended periods of time or indefinitely. Electrolyte and glucose abnormalities and medications at high or low levels, when corrected, usually lead to seizure control. This review discusses the risk for seizures with commonly encountered types of brain injuries in the NICU and ends by examining the treatment algorithms for simple seizures and status epilepticus and the role newer antiepileptics may potentially play.",

The physical dependence characterized by a state of distress and an overpowering desire to consume more ethanol, assumes three forms: ( a) “inability to stop” the ingestion (Jellinek's “loss of control”) noted moments after ingesting a small quantity of ethanol following a period of abstinence, which characterizes the gamma or intermittent clinical form of alcoholism; ( b) “inability to abstain” from ethanol hours after the last ingestion and after continuous drinking (each 4 to 8 hours during months or years), which characterizes the delta or inveterate clinical form of alcoholism, and ( c) primary physical dependence without ethanol having necessarily been ingested previously, which characterizes remittent, or epsilon alcoholism or dipsomania.",

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

The distribution of different causes may reflect the geographic location of the hospital. The most common substances used for self-inflicted death by poisoning are tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates (particularly children), and street drugs. In the elderly, suicide attempts and unintentional intoxication through misjudgment of dose remain the leading causes. Overdose and acute brain injury may go together. Patients with traumatic brain injury may have been intoxicated or overdosed and some strokes are seen after use of illicit drugs. It is important to assess the severity of the intoxication, but also the management of the patient particularly when there are recurrent seizures or permanent unexplained unconsciousness. The neurointensivist should have a good working knowledge of the pharmacodynamics of ingested or injected drugs in large quantities and how to interpret neuroimaging.",

These symptoms can include problems with short-term memory, attention, planning, problem solving, impulsivity, disinhibition, poor motivation, and other behavioral and cognitive deficits (\"frontal lobe syndrome\"). These symptoms may respond to certain drugs, such as dopaminergic agents. This case series describes results of using amantadine in 7 patients with this type of symptom profile (6 with TBI, 1 with meningitis following sinus surgery). Patients received neuropsychiatric examinations and serial neuropsychological testing. All patients showed some degree of positive response. One had side effects that resolved upon discontinuation of drug. The rationale for using dopaminergics is discussed, and pertinent literature is reviewed.",

The occurrence of OSA has also been linked to serious long‐term adverse health consequences; such as hypertension, metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive deficits and motor vehicle accidents. There have been several advances in the field of particular clinical importance: (i) the development of portable monitoring as part of a simplified clinical algorithm for the diagnosis of OSA in selected patients; (ii) growing awareness of the cardio‐metabolic health consequences of OSA and (iii) emerging evidence to support a range of non‐continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment modalities, such as oral appliances.",

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is defined by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) [1] as \"a physiological condition in which mental or physical performance is reduced due to lack of sleep or prolonged arousal, circadian phase, or workload (mental and physical activity) that may impair the attention of a crew member and the ability to safely operate an aircraft or perform safety-related tasks\".Fatigue among airline pilots is associated with various contributing fac-tors, including irregular working hours, long duty schedules, disruptions of circadian rhythm, and insufficient sleep [2-4].Along with work-related characteristics, fatigue could be associated with a health condition, type of lifestyle, quality of lifestyle, and emotional distress.Pilot fatigue is a significant problem in airline operations.Fatigue can affect pilots' performance and productivity in their job, such as decreased attention, memory difficulties, and lower psychomotor speed [5].",

Ces troubles cognitifs sont souvent multifactoriels, en rapport avec : 1) la pathologie causale (type de lesion, evolutivite …) ; 2) les manifestations cliniques de decharges ictales et/ou interictales, fonction de la localisation et de la lateralisation du foyer epileptique (les signes psychiques survenant pendant ou au decours de la crise peuvent egarer le diagnostic.

A l’inverse, l’epilepsie represente une complication meconnue et sous-estimee des pathologies dementielles en general et de la maladie d’Alzheimer en particulier. Si les crises partielles predominent chez les sujets âges non dements, il n’est pas rare de rencontrer des crises generalisees (tonico-cloniques, myocloniques…) chez les patients dements. Faire un diagnostic d’epilepsie et caracteriser une crise, dans cette population, reste donc un exercice difficile et impose, dans tous les cas, un bilan etiologique pour rechercher une cause, et une prise en charge therapeutique et psychosociale, tant les consequences medico-sociales de l’epilepsie peuvent etre nefastes chez ces patients.",

      "title": "Case report: Remission of chronic low back pain and oral dysesthesia comorbid with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder by treatment with atomoxetine and pramipexole",
      "abstract": "Oral dysesthesia is a disease characterized by pain and/or abnormal sensations in the oral region, without any organic abnormality. Its symptoms include pain, and it is considered to be a disorder associated with idiopathic oral-facial pain. It is also known that idiopathic oral-facial pain tends to coexist with chronic musculoskeletal pain, including low back pain, even before its onset. Such coexisting idiopathic pain conditions are also called chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs). In general, COPCs are often refractory to treatment. Recently, it has been reported that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with many COPCs, such as pain in the facial and lower back regions and so on. However, there are no reports of (1) ADHD as a comorbidity with oral dysesthesia (OD) or (2) of the therapeutic effects of ADHD medications or dopamine agonists on low back pain and OD or an (3) evaluation of cerebral blood flow over time after treatment with these medications for OD and low back pain.In this study, we report the case of an 80-year-old man with OD and chronic low back pain that persisted for more than 25 years. His OD and chronic back pain were refractory to standard treatment, prevented him from continuing work, and tended to be exacerbated by conflicts in his relationship with his son. In recent years, ADHD has often been found to be comorbid with chronic pain, and ADHD medications have been reported to improve chronic pain as well. The patient was confirmed to have undiagnosed ADHD and was treated with the ADHD medication atomoxetine and dopamine agonist pramipexole, which dramatically improved his OD, chronic back pain, and cognitive function. Furthermore, along the course of treatment, there was improvement in cerebral blood flow in his prefrontal cortex, which was thought to reflect improved function in the region. Consequently, he was able to resume work and improve his family relationships.Therefore, in the cases of ODs and COPCs, screening for ADHD and, if ADHD is diagnosed, ADHD medications or dopamine agonists may be considered.",

Such observations support the view that stopping treatment is not equivalent to being untreated. With lithium, antipsychotics and antidepressants, there is consistent evidence that abrupt or rapid discontinuation is followed by earlier clinical worsening than with more gradual removal of treatment. Moreover, treatment discontinuation can complicate interpretation of responses to changes in treatment, including in clinical practice and in experimental treatment trials. Notably, terminating preceding treatments can lead to both discontinuation and carry-over effects that can have an impact on the interpretation of observed outcomes.",

      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (&amp;#x03C7;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

Discontinuation was followed by relapse, and resumption by repeat improvement. This finding suggests these tentative psychopharmacological speculations: 1. paranoid patients may suffer either an excess or deficit of dopamine or other catecholamine, 2. those who claim neuroleptics make them worse may suffer a deficit, 3. such cases may specifically indicate a catecholaminergic drug rather than an antidopaminergic neuroleptic, and 4. knowledge of such individual differences may provide a rationale for more precise psychopharmacotherapy.",

But the principle of double effect should not be used to justify the administration of large doses of opiates or other mind-altering medications under the assumption that a dying patient should or might be having pain, anxiety, or dyspnea. What makes a dying patient uncomfortable or causes them suffering must be determined and appropriately treated. The assessment should include the following questions: Is the patient experiencing physiological pain? Is the discomfort caused by psychological, emotional, or spiritual distress (suffering)? Or is there a particular distressing symptom that needs to be identified and appropriately treated? Medicine and nursing practice are based on the assessment and treatment of disease and symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL) is a demyelinating syndrome characterized by acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms days to weeks following apparent recovery from coma after a period of prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation. It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

      "abstract": "Drugs used in sexual assault, which are also called as date rape drugs, are common phenomenon of crime in many countries. In a typical scenario, a perpetrator adds a date-rape drug which has sedative effect into alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person. After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault.",

Accumulation of active metabolites of opioids can cause a well-recognized toxidrome including respiratory depression (RD), decreased conscious level, pinpoint pupils, and drop in blood pressure. Opioid toxicity is often associated with amount ingested and its speed of absorption in the body. This can have life-threatening effects on various body systems. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that competitively binds to opioid receptors and reverses all their effects. The indication for use is RD because of known or suspected opioid overdose. This article presents a case report of 61-year-old female, a case of advanced pancreatic cancer, progressed on disease-modifying treatments and referred to palliative care for best supportive care. She developed features of morphine toxicity that was promptly identified and managed with use of naloxone and other supportive measures.",

Other agents are responsible for drop of arterial pressure by changing position, including antihypertensive drugs, alpha-blocking agents used in urology, antipsychotics, cyclic antidepressants, vasodilators and nitrates, dopaminergic antiparkinson drugs, sedatives, etc. Only drug with true ototoxic properties will be discussed here, namely substances that are able to damage the inner ear (cochlear or vestibular damage) or the VIIIth cranial nerve, causing impairment of equilibrium and/or (most often) hearing. No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

Recent studies suggest that 25-40% of people who suffer a psychotic episode recover and never have another episode. A number of non-specific cognitive, affective and behavioural changes often herald the onset of psychosis. Higher than recommended doses of antipsychotics do not produce quicker or better outcomes, only more side-effects. Maintenance antipsychotic medication is required to reduce the risk of relapse. Psychosocial interventions must accompany medication. The most serious psychiatric complications are depression and suicide. GPs are well placed to promote good health and provide advice on minimising risk factors such as smoking. It is important to actively involve the patient in all aspects of his or her care and not to place excessive emphasis on 'compliance'. (author abstract)",

      "abstract": "espanolLa adiccion a los preparados de cannabis sativa es un problema relevante en nuestra sociedad, con especial importancia durante la adolescencia. Su facil disponibilidad y los episodios adversos asociados a su abuso y/o dependencia han incrementado la demanda de tratamiento derivada por su consumo. En los ultimos 20 anos se ha podido avanzar mucho sobre la farmacologia del cannabis y de sus principios activos, moleculas grasas que actuan a traves de un sistema de senalizacion endogeno denominado sistema endocannabinoide implicado en el desarrollo y la plasticidad cerebrales. Su estimulacion cronica puede inducir no solo dependencia y adiccion, sino tambien derivar en consecuencias neurobiologicas que tienen repercusion clinica. Asi, por un lado se puede encontrar el incremento de trastornos mentales tanto primarios como inducidos (trastornos del estado de animo, trastornos de ansiedad y trastornos psicoticos) y por el otro, alteraciones en los procesos cognitivos (memoria, atencion, toma de decisiones, asuncion de riesgos, control de impulsos). Estas consecuencias son mas graves si el consumo se realiza en la adolescencia. Algunos de estos efectos son permanentes y el conocimiento de los mismos necesario para una correcta atencion sanitaria. EnglishAddiction to products derived from the plant cannabis sativa has become a relevant problem in western societies. Its prevalence in both teenagers and young adults has grown in the last decade. The problem is aggravated by the availability of plant derivatives with a high THC content. Today, the number of cannabis users requesting medical treatment is growing, as well as the incidence and variety of the adverse effects associated with its chronic consumption. On the other hand, the last 20 years� research have revealed the hidden pharmacology of the active principles of cannabis. Cannabinoids, the psychoactive chemicals of the plant, exert their pharmacological actions through their interaction with an endogenous signaling system, the endocannabinoid system. This system is involved in brain development, plasticity and repair, and its chronic stimulation can induce not only dependence/addiction, but also result in adverse clinical effects. The negative side of cannabis use has greatest impact in the adolescent period. The main adverse effects of chronic cannabis use include the increase in the incidence of mental disorders (mainly psychosis), as well as alterations in cognitive processes including memory, attention, decision-making, risk behaviors as well as impulsivity. Some of these effects are permanent and information and research on their nature is greatly needed in order to achieve a correct public health approach to cannabis use.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of bipolar disorders is about 4% of the population. Among the patients the emergence of cognitive disorders has been identified. These disorders can sometimes result in authentic dementia-like syndromes. The neuropsychological characteristics of the cognitive impairment include disorders of the steady attention, executive functions, memory and language. This group of cognitive disorders leads to a subcorticofrontal syndrome. Different neuroanatomical bases have been suggested. The most common etiopathogenic hypothesis retains a cumulative neurological toxicity of the thymic episodes (depression or mania). The role of psychoactive treatments must be taken into account. The secondary cognitive effects of psychoactive drugs usually used in bipolar disorder (lithium, antiepileptics, antidepressants, antipsychotics or tranquillizers) are similar to the cognitive impairment associated with the disease. Differentiation between cognitive disorders related to the pathology and those related to its treatment is difficult. The optimal use of the therapeutic drug classes, preferring antipsychotics of second generation and avoiding products with anticholinergic effect, is essential. There is no specific pharmacological treatment for this dementia syndrome. Psychological approaches offer an alternative way of care, which remains to be investigated and validated. Prevention of iatrogenic effects of drugs constitutes, presently, the main therapeutic intervention.",

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased health-care costs, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline are well-recognized outcomes of delirium. Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

PD jest chorobą postępującą, w której dochodzi do utraty neuronów dopaminowych istoty czarnej (SN) a cechą patologiczną jest obecność ciał Lewy'ego, złożonych m.in. z białka ?-synukleiny. Gdy utrata neuronów w SN przekroczy ok. 60% wówczas pojawiają się główne objawy kliniczne (ruchowe), czyli bradykinezja, sztywność mięśniowa, drżenie spoczynkowe i zaburzenia postawy, chodu. PD jest chorobą o złożonej etiopatogenezie, w której bardzo ważny jest okres przedkliniczny/prodromalny, bowiem pojawiają się wówczas objawy pozaruchowe, np. osłabienie węchu, depresja czy zaburzenia snu, wyprzedzające nawet o kilkanaście lat fazę kliniczną. Niniejsza praca, poza opisem podstawowych informacji na temat PD, skupia się na zaburzeniach snu, wśród których najważniejszym jest zaburzenie zachowania w czasie snu REM, które może stanowić wczesny marker diagnostyczny rozwijającej się choroby, a tym samym pomóc w poszukiwaniu nowych terapii neuroprotekcyjnych już na wczesnym, prodromalnym etapie.",

Although the elderly demented patient is at greatest risk, such complications have also been noted during treatment of younger patients. Treatment with anticholinergics may lead to a confusional state and decreased memory function in some patients, especially the elderly and those with preexisting dementia. Monoamine oxidase inhibition is considered quite benign when used alone, but may potentiate certain side effects when used in combination with other compounds. Ergot alkaloid medication, which is usually combined with levodopa, often induces severe psychiatric complications. Typical findings with levodopa treatment indicate little or no positive impact on cognition, apart from nonspecific arousal and alleviation of concomitant depressive affect. Guidelines for the management of neuropsychological and psychiatric side effects are suggested.",

The frequency and severity of the psychological disturbances are difficult to determine because many factors confound the interpretation of evidence whether it results from open case reports, controlled clinical trials, or neuropsychological testing. Concern about potential problems should not preclude trying an AED if other properties make the agent otherwise appropriate because the occurrence of adverse effects is often unpredictable in any given individual. Impairment can be minimized by gradual titration of dose and limiting total dose as clinically possible. If psychological problems arise and fine titration of the AED cannot eliminate the problem, the drug can be discontinued without permanent life threatening sequellae.",

At least four such categories can be distinguished: assistive devices (a) that are not designed specifically for speech, (b) that take the average characteristics of speech into account, (c) that process articulatory or phonetic characteristics of speech, and (d) that embody some degree of automatic speech recognition. Assistive devices for people with speech and/or language disabilities typically involve some form of speech synthesis or symbol generation for severe forms of language disability. Speech synthesis is also used in text-to-speech systems for sightless persons.

Withdrawal symptoms include dysphoria, yawning, tearing, diarrhea, cramps, nausea, and piloerection. Buprenorphine, methadone, clonidine, and lofexidine can be used to ameliorate the symptoms of withdrawal. However, supervised withdrawal alone rarely leads to long-term abstinence. There are a number of psychosocial treatments, including self-help groups, outpatient therapy, and residential treatment; the data on their effectiveness are limited. Pharmacotherapy with an opioid agonist (methadone or buprenorphine) is the most effective treatment. Long-acting injectable naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is also effective, but it is more difficult to initiate.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Opioids have been used for at least 7,000 years in the treatment of acute pain, to aid sleep and to promote euphoria. Their short-term benefits are well-recognised, but longer-term benefits are less well understood and associated harms well-known. For pain lasting beyond the acute period, the prescribed use of strong opioids was, until recently, mainly restricted to cancer and palliative care, when life expectancy is limited. More recently, however, we have seen rapidly increasing use of both strong and weak opioids for chronic non-malignant pain. This has particularly been in North America where an “opioid epidemic” is apparent, but similar patterns are emerging across the world, including Europe. The commonest problems with long-term use of opioids include constipation, nausea and sedation. Other, perhaps more serious problems include hyperalgesia, endocrine and immune dysfunction, mood disorders, tolerance, addiction and death. Our systematic review estimated an incidence of iatrogenic misuse or addiction of ~4% among all people prescribed an opioid. The other problem is with the lack of high quality evidence to support their effectiveness in the long-term relief of pain, as we will hear later. These concerns have prompted the International Association for the Study of Pain to issue a recent carefully-worded statement on the use of opioids in chronic pain, advising caution and close monitoring. This presentation will summarise these issues, and present evidence of the increasing use of opioids in recent years, focusing on Europe and particularly Scotland, where prescribing rates rose 65% in a 10 year period. I will present evidence of both good and potentially harmful prescribing, evidence that most prescribing is “appropriate” in that it is associated with severe chronic pain, and, despite this, that a very large proportion of people with chronic pain are not prescribed any opioid. Opioids may still have a role in chronic non-malignant pain, but the goals of their use need to be increased function and improved quality of life, and we need careful selection of patients and evaluation of outcomes. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> B.

The human desire to avoid suffering powerfully shapes our behavior, extremely so in the face of torture, more routinely when coping with chronic pain [1]. Thus, a suffering patient confronts the clinician with both a professional and personal dilemma, particularly in the context of the remnants of opiophobia in society (such as in sectors of the medical profession and in regulatory groups):\n\n“Should I withhold pain-relieving medication (e.g., engage in torture) and expose the patient to the well-established deleterious consequences of untreated pain; or, should I prescribe opioids, risking (hypothetically) consequences to the patient, such as addiction, and risking professional sanction or even criminal investigation?”\n\nWe now justify using opioids for pain control, in the face of opiophobia, with the notion that uncontrolled pain has a more deleterious effect on functioning than do the opioids themselves [2]. The work of Zaczny and others [3–4], which is primarily based upon studies of persons with opioid addiction, not chronic pain, suggests that cognitive impairment is minimal on stable doses of opioids. Our collective clinical experience in pain medicine suggests that the benefits of pain relief from opioids, for example, helping someone to concentrate on the tasks of driving, to remain at work, or to sleep at night to avoid fatigue-related impairment …",

      "title": "Opioid Treatment of Chronic Nonmalignant Pain1",
      "abstract": "The use of opiates to manage chronic pain originating from cancer or its treatment is well established clinical practice founded on a number of controlled clinical studies [1,2]. Recently, the treatment of various nonmalignant chronic pain syndromes with opioids has been proposed based on an accumulation of case reports and uncontrolled open studies [3-10]. In some of those reports, the authors are remarkably enthusiastic, but in others the conclusions are rather cautious [3,11,12]. The only consensus is that opioid tolerance, physical dependence or addiction seldom cause difficulties [6]. With regard to the efficacy of opioid treatment, however, many authors merely conclude either that only a small subpopulation of patients with chronic noncancer pain obtain partial pain reduction [11], or that opioids neither substantially improve nor undermine the patient's function [5]. With regard to side effects, some uncontrolled reports neither demonstrate nor exclude a risk of neuropsychologic impairment and other untoward effects [5]. A preliminary controlled study shows significantly disabled cognitive and psychomotor functioning, as well as typical opioid side effects such as constipation and nausea [13]. Thus, the conclusions from these preliminary and uncontrolled reports are ambivalent at best. The aim of this article is to review the available controlled studies that have examined the efficacy and/or adverse side effects of opioids in chronic nonmalignant pain. Controlled Efficacy Studies Several studies have tested the effects of short courses of opioid administration against placebo. In some of these trials, opioids were given intravenously for up to one hour [14-17]. In the other studies, one single dose was given orally [18] or twice daily doses were given orally over seven days [19]. Arner and Meyerson [14] differentiated between nociceptive (e.g., from pancreatitis or nephrolithiasis), neuropathic pain, and idiopathic pain (i.e., without demonstrable organic pathology). They found that various opioids (buprenorphine, morphine, ketobemidone, meperidine, pentazocine), given in test infusions of 15 minutes' duration, effectively alleviated nociceptive but not neuropathic or idiopathic pain. Kupers et al. [15] found that morphine, given in divided intravenous doses over a period of 50 minutes, reduced affective but not sensory scores of neuropathic pain and did not alter idiopathic pain. Three studies examined patients with postherpetic neuralgia: Max et al. [18] found no effects of oral codeine, Eide et al. [17] found no pain relief but inhibition of allodynia by intravenous morphine, Rowbotham et al. [16] reported significant reductions of pain and allodynia following one-hour infusions of 20 mg morphine. In patients with rheumatic, back, and other skeletal pain syndromes, Arkinstall et al. [19] found that average daily doses of 273 mg of oral codeine significantly decreased subjective pain intensity levels, consumption of rescue analgesics, and disability scores. All of these studies reported significant side effects. These findings suggest that opioids may be effective in some types of neuropathic or nociceptive pain but not in idiopathic pain. However, in all of these trials, opioids were given only over short periods of time, and this fact greatly limits the conclusions that may be drawn therefrom. There is only one placebo-controlled study investigating the long-term use of opioids in chronic noncancer pain [20]. In this investigation, patients with chronic regional pain of soft tissue or musculoskeletal origin who had not responded to codeine, antiinflammatory drugs, and antidepressants, received a sustained-release preparation of oral morphine up to 60 mg twice daily over a period of 11 weeks. Aside from subjective pain levels and the consumption of rescue medication, psychological features, including anxiety and depression, were assessed using a battery of psychological tests and questionnaires. Quality of life issues, functional status, cognition, and the propensity to psychological dependence or addiction were also evaluated. The 46 patients who completed the study used an average daily dose of 83 mg morphine and showed a significant reduction in pain intensity relative to placebo. However, no significant differences in any of the other variables were detected, including a lack of overall patient preference of morphine. The authors concluded that morphine may confer analgesic benefit with a low risk of addiction but is unlikely to yield psychological or functional improvement. Assessing the Entire Patient What are the reasons for the low efficacy of opioids in idiopathic and other kinds of chronic nonmalignant pain, and why are there so few controlled long-term studies? The unimpressive performance of morphine in the trial by Moulin et al. [20] led the authors to question whether opioids could produce an analgesic response if there were a major affective component to the pain, or if learned pain behavior is the main problem. The central point to keep in mind is that the whole patient must be evaluated, not just the pain [21]. Pain is not only a symptom of underlying tissue injury (i.e., nociception), but the combination of subjective experiences, including noxious sensations (which may occur with or without nociception), suffering (i.e., affective and emotional responses to distress or perceived threats), and observable behavioral changes (e.g., disability, excessive use of the health care system) [22]. The report of pain and pain behavior is influenced and maintained by a host of factors including nociception, dysfunction, mood states (e.g., depression, anxiety, disappointment), cultural conditioning, expectations, social contingencies, and secondary gains (e.g., spouse attention, job happiness, relationships with coworkers, litigation, pain medication, control over family and physicians) [22,23]. Thus the target of intervention is not only the source of nociception (if at all identifiable) but also suffering, dysfunction, psychosocial factors, and the dependence on the health care system. Consequently, in the present context, the central question is: Should opioids be used to treat all of these factors [24]? There is little doubt that opioids can inhibit nociception, but should depression, anxiety, or job unhappiness be treated with opiates? Will opioids solve litigation and compensation issues? Will they improve relationships with coworkers or decrease dependence on the health care system? It seems likely that they may achieve the opposite, e.g., an increased dependence on health care services since analgesics can function as a reinforcer of pain behavior and drug intake [25-28]. Thus, the vicious cycle is not broken but instead maintained. Conclusions Clearly, the treatment goals in chronic nonmalignant pain are a reduction of symptoms, suffering and environmental reinforcers of pain behavior, as well as functional improvement, a decreased dependence on the health care system, and the return to work. Analgesics are only part of this treatment. The usual approach is multimodal and includes graduated exercise programs, the encouragement of activity, and cognitive, behavioral and/or supportive measures to provide functional restoration despite continuing pain [29,30]. A powerful drug may encourage passivity and make patients less compliant with their entire treatment program [20]. There is a need for prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies examining the long-term administration of opioids and their effects on all of the above factors. Future studies should demonstrate positive outcomes, not only in terms of pain reports, but also in terms of reduced suffering, depression, functional improvement, reemployment, and decreased use of the health care system. Finally, while case reports have suggested that there may be a subpopulation of patients who may benefit from opioids, future studies need to clearly identify groups of patients that are suitable for this form of therapy. Before more randomized and controlled studies begin to appear in the peer-reviewed literature, the efficacy of opioids in chronic nonmalignant pain remains scientifically unproven.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely used psychostimulant worldwide. Excessive caffeine consumption induces a series of both acute and chronic biological and physiological changes that may give rise to cognitive decline, depression, fatigue, insomnia, cardiovascular changes, and headache. Chronic consumption of caffeine promotes a pro-nociceptive state of cortical hyperexcitability that can intensify a primary headache or trigger a headache due to excessive analgesic use. This review offers an in-depth analysis of the physiological mechanisms of caffeine and its relationship with headache. La cafeína es la droga psicoestimulante más ampliamente utilizada en el mundo. El exagerado consumo de cafeína induce una serie de cambios biológicos y fisiológicos de forma aguda y crónica, que se pueden traducir en déficit cognitivo, depresión, fatiga, insomnio, cambios cardiovasculares y cefalea. El consumo crónico de cafeína promueve un estado pronociceptivo y de hiperexcitabilidad cortical que puede exacerbar una cefalea primaria o desencadenar una cefalea por uso excesivo de analgésicos. El objetivo de la revisión es profundizar en los aspectos fisiológicos de la cafeína y su relación con la cefalea.",

      "abstract": "En los ultimos anos ha aumentado el numero de ninos en tratamiento con psicoestimulantes por trastorno de deficit de atencion e hiperactividad (TDAH). Dicho aumento ha ido acompanado de un uso no medico en adultos, bien por motivos recreacionales o con la finalidad de aumentar el rendimiento, academico o profesional. ?Tienen estas situaciones alguna relacion? En la infancia se utilizan los psicoestimulantes para tratar una enfermedad, con lo que en sentido estricto se utilizan exclusivamente como terapia. Pero al haberse relajado la interpretacion de los criterios diagnosticos del TDAH se plantea una situacion diferente, de medicalizacion (proceso por el cual queda bajo el control medico una situacion previamente vivida como fuera de ese ambito), mas que de mejoramiento (uso de un farmaco o tecnologia para mejorar una actividad de un sujeto sano). El aumento del uso de psicoestimulantes en la infancia seria un caso de medicalizacion. Este uso cada vez mas frecuente en la infancia tendria un efecto normalizador, de uso cotidiano. En la adolescencia y edad adulta, con dificultad para mantener o establecer el diagnostico de TDAH, se podria usar con criterios diferentes, de automedicacion con la finalidad de mejoramiento. Se analiza si el concepto de �enfermedad� que utilicemos puede llevar a un mayor o menor uso de psicofarmacos en la infancia, y si podria influir tambien en la edad adulta.",

      "title": "Third Generation Antipsychotic Drugs: Partial Agonism or Receptor Functional Selectivity?",
      "abstract": "Functional selectivity is the term that describes drugs that cause markedly different signaling through a single receptor (e.g., full agonist at one pathway and antagonist at a second). It has been widely recognized recently that this phenomenon impacts the understanding of mechanism of action of some drugs, and has relevance to drug discovery. One of the clinical areas where this mechanism has particular importance is in the treatment of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs have been grouped according to both pattern of clinical action and mechanism of action. The original antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been called typical or first generation. They cause both antipsychotic actions and many side effects (extrapyramidal and endocrine) that are ascribed to their high affinity dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism. Drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and others were then developed that avoided the neurological side effects (atypical or second generation antipsychotics). These compounds are divided mechanistically into those that are high affinity D(2) and 5-HT(2A) antagonists, and those that also bind with modest affinity to D(2), 5-HT(2A), and many other neuroreceptors. There is one approved third generation drug, aripiprazole, whose actions have been ascribed alternately to either D(2) partial agonism or D(2) functional selectivity. Although partial agonism has been the more widely accepted mechanism, the available data are inconsistent with this mechanism. Conversely, the D(2) functional selectivity hypothesis can accommodate all current data for aripiprazole, and also impacts on discovery compounds that are not pure D(2) antagonists.",

      "title": "Optic Nerve Atrophy in Heroin Intoxication",
      "abstract": "Drug dependence is one of important social problems in modern society. It became more actual because of the high morbidity in young working-age patients. The central nervous system is the main target for psychoactive substances. Long-term drug intoxication results in functional and structural brain alterations, it leads to cognitive impairment and disturbances of higher mental functions rendering patients’ disadapted in their work and daily life activities. Eye disorders due to drug abuse are multifaceted and can vary from conjunctival damage to severe endogenous endophthalmitis. Opioid dependence can result not only from intentional self-administration of narcotic drugs, but also from long-term prescribed use of these medicinal products owing to their potent analgesic effect exhibited in somatically ill patients with severe chronic pain. Opioid derivatives act as partial or full agonists of three types of opioid receptors (δ, κ, and µ) extensively expressed by the neurons of the central and, to a lesser extent, peripheral nervous system. The most dangerous complication of intoxication with this group narcotic drugs is opioid induced-respiratory depression resulting in hypoxaemia and hypercapnia. The paper presents a case report of bilateral optic nerve atrophy that developed in a young female patient after a long period of intravenous heroin use. There are practically no reports of optic nerve damage due to heroin intoxication in the current literature. Possible optic nerve atrophy mechanisms under discussion include generalized hypoxia developing against a background of chronic heroin intoxication and direct toxicity of admixtures used to dilute home-made narcotic drugs. In view of the growing use of these substances, physicians have to consider their effects in the differential diagnosis in patients with atypical eye disorders.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is a rare and underreported phenomenon. When patients ingest large amounts of cocaine, patients can experience seizures. Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome: Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Management, and Potential Future Directions",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

      "abstract": "This critical review focuses on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its management from a dental medicine perspective. OSA is characterized by ≥10-s cessation of breathing (apnea) or reduction in airflow (hypopnea) ≥5 times per hour with a drop in oxygen and/or rise in carbon dioxide. It can be associated with sleepiness and fatigue, impaired mood and cognition, cardiometabolic complications, and risk for transportation and work accidents. Although sleep apnea is diagnosed by a sleep physician, its management is interdisciplinary. The dentist’s role includes 1) screening patients for OSA risk factors (e.g., retrognathia, high arched palate, enlarged tonsils or tongue, enlarged tori, high Mallampati score, poor sleep, supine sleep position, obesity, hypertension, morning headache or orofacial pain, bruxism); 2) referring to an appropriate health professional as indicated; and 3) providing oral appliance therapy followed by regular dental and sleep medical follow-up. In addition to the device features and provider expertise, anatomic, behavioral, demographic, and neurophysiologic characteristics can influence oral appliance effectiveness in managing OSA. Therefore, OSA treatment should be tailored to each patient individually. This review highlights some of the putative action mechanisms related to oral appliance effectiveness and proposes future research directions.",

[10][11][12][13][14][15] Legal problems are especially likely in persons with criminal records and high impulsivity. 13The risk of adverse outcomes decreases markedly with abstinence from opioids. 9,16",

Induction of mania in our patient is keeping with the literature regarding induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at a lower dose of quetiapine. Hypomanic or manic symptoms at a low dose of quetiapine are brief and seem to reverse the effect by either discontinuing the causing agent or increasing it dose. Quetiapine being an atypical antipsychotic possess antidepressant property at low doses as well as mood stabilizer at higher doses. At lower dose, due to its serotonergic antagonism property, quetiapine appears to induce or worsen hypomanic or manic symptoms. As the dosage increases its dopamine antagonistic activity become more prominent and the medication acts as a mood stabilizer. This is one of the possible explanations of disappearing of manic or hypomanic symptoms at a higher dose.",

In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children.

On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium.

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

We wonder if other anti‐epileptic medications produce the same results. Objective comparative research is still to be carried out. Periodical psychological examinations in order to assess the effects of treatment would be useful to avoid psychic perturbations which could, in the long run, cause severe intellectual and affective maladjustment. RÉSUMÉ Le traitement à base de Zarontin, surtout à forte dose et à certaines périodes critiques du développement de l'enfant (adolescence) est susceptible d'engendrer des troubles psychiques profonds affectant à la fois la sphère intellectuelle et affective. On peut se demander si d'autres médications anti‐comitiales ne produiraient pas chez l'enfant des effets similaires. Des études comparatives objectives restent à faire. En clinique, un contrôle psychologique de l'effet des thérapeutiques s'avère utile si on veut éviter des perturbations psychiques susceptibles d'entraîner à la longue chez l'enfant de graves inadaptations intellectuelles et affectives.",

PD is the second most common neurodegenerative condition affecting not only older people of developed countries but also in people of developed countries in their 50’s and 60’s. Though it greatly affects motor system, psychotic symptoms such as delusion, hallucination mostly develop at a later stage of disease after several years but early development at the very beginning of the course has also been reported. Delusion can also develop as an inevitable outcome of dopaminergic drugs like carbidopalevodopa, a common drug-class prescribed at the very beginning of the diagnosis increasing the availability of dopamine in the brain. It’s the clinical experience that propounded this link between psychosis and medication use. Psychosis can impact patient’s daily life in a severe manner making it more frightening and could be life threatening at times. Therefore, differentiation between the delusion as a symptom and delusion as an effect of medication onset is a crucial part of PD management.",

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

      "title": "The Clinically Meaningful Link Between Alcohol Use and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.",
      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood mental health disorder that can lead to alcohol and other drug (AOD)-related problems if it persists into adolescence and adulthood. Several findings suggest that ADHD contributes to the development of AOD use disorders. ADHD generally precedes alcohol use and is correlated with developmentally inappropriate levels of alcohol use or abuse; conduct problems typically precede the development of alcohol use or abuse. The potential role of ADHD in the development of AOD use problems has important implications for prevention and treatment of such problems. For example, people with ADHD have poor outcomes from AOD abuse treatment. Service providers who work in AGO abuse treatment settings must develop the diagnostic and clinical expertise to address co-occurring ADHD and AOD use disorders. KEY WORDS: attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity; alcohol and other drug dependence; alcoholic beverage; comorbidity; impulsive behavior; symptom; early AODU (alcohol and other drug use) onset, conduct disorder; diagnostic criteria; causal pathways; predictive factor; treatment outcome; correlation analysis; literature review ********** Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood mental health disorder that is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It has been discussed in the psychiatric literature for approximately 100 years under various names, including minimal brain dysfunction; hyperkinetic reaction of childhood; attention deficit disorder; and, since 1987, ADHD. The various names reflect an evolving understanding of the disorder and an increasing consensus on its nature. One of the major recent advances in the research on ADHD is the recognition that most people who are diagnosed with it as children continue to suffer problems related to this disorder as adolescents and adults (Barkley 1998; Tucker 1999). This recognition that ADHD extends beyond puberty has expanded ADHD research into new areas, including the link between ADHD and alcohol use and abuse. To provide the appropriate background for understanding the link between ADHD and alcohol use, this article first summarizes the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. It then examines the hypothesis that ADHD is a causal factor in the development of problematic alcohol consumption. Finally, the article reviews some preliminary research suggesting that ADHD and its treatment may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of alcohol-related problems. DIAGNOSIS OF ADHD According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) (2000), the rate of ADHD in the general population of children in the United States is between 3 and 7 percent. Among children receiving treatment for psychiatric disorders in clinical settings, however, this rate often exceeds 50 percent (Barkley 1998), making ADHD one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders for children in the United States. The rare of ADHD in adults is thought to be somewhat lower than in children, probably between 2 and 5 percent in the general population (Barkley 1998). For adults in clinical settings, the rate of ADHD is currently unknown bur appears to be substantially elevated compared with the general population. Among adult patients receiving treatment for alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse, the rate of ADHD has been estimated to be approximately 25 percent (Wilens 1998). A similar rare of ADHD, about 30 percent, has been found among adolescents in treatment for AOD use disorders (AODD) (Molina et al. 2002). These relatively high rates indicate that it is important for service providers in AOD-abuse treatment settings to be able to diagnose and treat ADHD. The symptoms or problems associated with ADHD vary somewhat depending on the patient's developmental stage (Barkley 1998). Children with ADHD typically present with academic difficulties, discipline problems at school and at home, and conflicts with peers. …",

      "abstract": "Opioid misuse, including the use of heroin and the overprescribing, misuse, and diversion of opioid pain medications, has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in opioid use disorder and associated overdoses and deaths. Addiction is a chronic brain disease with a genetic component that affects motivation, inhibition, and cognition. Patient characteristics associated with successful buprenorphine maintenance treatment include stable or controlled medical or psychiatric comorbidities and a safe, substance-free environment. As a partial opioid agonist, buprenorphine has a ceiling effect that limits respiratory depression and adds to its safety in accidental or intentional overdose. Buprenorphine and combinations of buprenorphine and naloxone are generally well tolerated; adverse effects include anxiety, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea, and sedation. Family physicians who meet specific requirements can obtain a Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 waiver by notifying the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of their intent to begin dispensing and/or prescribing buprenorphine. Medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine is as effective as methadone in terms of treatment retention and decreased opioid use when prescribed at fixed dosages of at least 7 mg per day; dosages of 16 mg per day are clearly superior to placebo. Sporadic opioid use is not uncommon in the first few months of medication-assisted treatment and should be addressed by increased visit frequency and more intensive engagement with behavioral therapies. Follow-up visits should include documentation of any relapses, reemergence of cravings or withdrawal, random urine drug testing, pill or wrapper counts, and checks of state prescription drug database records.",

      "abstract": "You've been treating Mr. H, a 54-year-old factory worker and tobacco user, for depression that developed after a work-related back injury and subsequent disability. His depression has had a fair response to an antidepressant. He also has been maintained on chronic opioids (morphine and oxycodone/acetaminophen) for 18 months by his primary care physician (PCP). At the end of your appointment, he asks you for a refill of the opioids because he ran out early because of increased night pain and resultant insomnia and stress. He clarifies he has asked for early refills before from his PCP, but lately he has been denied. Because you seem to listen to me more, he asks for your help. How should you manage Mr. H? [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Opioids are among the most commonly misused prescription drugs in the United States. (1) In 2008, poisoning was the leading cause of death from injury in the United States; roughly 90% of poisonings resulted from drug exposure, and >40% of these drug poisonings were from prescription opioids. (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the number of emergency department (ED) visits for nonmedical use of opioids increased 111% between 2004 and 2008, from 144,600 to 305,900 visits. (3) The highest number of visits were for use of oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone. (3) Increased prescribing of opioids and overdose deaths attributable to prescribed opioids have raised concern among physicians about how to effectively treat pain as well as prevent, recognize, and manage aberrant medication-taking behaviors (AMTBs). Psychiatrists are well-positioned to screen and manage their own patients for prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) or collaborate with opioid prescribers to accomplish the same. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Clarifying terminology Terminology used to describe POUD and related conditions often is poorly defined or loosely applied. Because emotions often enter discussions between patients and physicians about problems related to opioid therapy, nonstigmatizing and more objective terminology is needed, and clinicians are working toward standardizing this. Relevant terms are defined in Table 1.

      "abstract": "【背景と目的】高齢者は，内服薬の種類が多いことや自己管理が困難になることがあり，定期処方の薬剤でも薬物中毒を引き起こし得る。今回，高齢者の急性薬物中毒の傾向について検討した。【対象と方法】2009年1月1日から2013年12月31日までの過去5年間に，当院救急外来で急性薬物中毒と診断した65歳以上の症例を対象とした。薬物依存症，診断が疑いの場合は，対象から除外した。自殺目的や誤ってなどで自ら過量服薬した故意的要素か，偶発的な事故的要素か，原因薬剤，主訴，転帰などを調査した。【結果】65歳以上の急性薬物中毒の総数は72例。84歳以下では故意による過量服薬が多かったが，超高齢者では定期内服による事故要素が多かった。原因薬物は，ベンゾジアゼピン系睡眠薬42例，フェノバルビタール8例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬もしくはβ遮断薬4例，テオフィリン2例，抗うつ薬2例，サリチル酸1例，アシクロビル1例であった。主訴は意識障害が35例と最も多く，ショックを伴っていたのは8例で，家族や施設職員などにより発見されていた。【結語】高齢であるほど故意による薬物中毒は少なく，定期内服による中毒が多かった。高齢者では腎機能障害を有している例が多いと考えられ，抗てんかん薬，ジギタリスを含む抗不整脈薬，降圧薬の作用増強・遷延が起こりやすい。 Background: In elderly people, drug intoxication in regular prescription setting, can be caused by too many kinds of oral medicines and with the difficulty in self–administration. We researched on the tendency of acute drug intoxication in elderly people. Methods: Patient over 65 years old who have been diagnosed acute drug intoxication at emergency department in our hospital last 5 years from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013 were included. We investigated on the cause, either intentional factors like suicide and overdose medication or contingent accident factors, offending drugs, chief complaint, living conditions and outcomes. Those who had suspected diagnosis or drug dependence case were excluded. Results: There were 72 cases of acute drug intoxication. In patients under 84 years old mostly overdosed intentionally, but on the other hand, in patients 85 years old or more had more accidental factor by taking drugs regularly. The offending drugs were benzodiazepine 42 cases, phenobarbital 8 cases, digitalis 8 cases, phenytoin 4 cases, calcium antagonist 4 cases, theophylline 2 cases, antidepressant 2 cases, salicylated 1 case, and acyclovir 1 case. The chief complaints were impaired consciousness in 35 cases which were the most, and 8 cases were in shock, which were found by family or facility workers. Conclusions: The higher the age is, the fewer intentional drug intoxication, and we have to consider there are many cases that have renal dysfunction in the elderly. 高齢者は，基礎疾患の多様性により多種類の併用薬剤や複数の医療機関受診による整理困難な内服処方を受けている場合が多い。その結果，定期処方であっても，自己管理が困難であることや，薬物代謝の加齢変化などが誘因となり，薬物有害事象が発生する。外来患者や介護施設でも高齢者の10%以上に薬物有害事象が見られ 1，高齢者入院の1.5%がこのような薬物有害事象による入院と報告 2されている。そこで，救急外来における高齢者の急性薬物中毒の傾向を調査し，高齢者診療における注意点を考察した。 また，本研究のヒトを対象とした研究にあたっては，Helsinki人権宣言に基づく倫理規定を遵守した。 対象は2009年1月1日から2013年12月31日までの過去5年間に，当院救急外来を受診し急性薬物中毒と診断された65歳以上の症例である。血糖降下薬，抗血小板薬，抗凝固薬が関連したと思われる症例，薬物依存症，中毒診断が疑いの場合，また毒劇物，農薬，アルコールなど医薬品以外の中毒は対象から除外した。カルテ記載を調査した後ろ向き研究であり，年齢階級別に65歳から74歳までの前期高齢者，75歳から84歳までの後期高齢者，85歳以上の超高齢者に分けて調査した。調査項目は，故意か事故か，主訴，生活背景（日常生活動作，居住環境），原因薬剤，転帰，腎機能とした。故意か事故かの判断については，正しい量を内服しているにもかかわらず，血中濃度が中毒域になり臨床症状が出現しているものを事故とし，それ以外の自殺企図目的やより効果を求めて過量服用したものは故意と区別した。また，認知機能低下などによる誤服用については正しい服用方法ではないため，今回の検討では故意に分類した。また，腎機能の指標となる糸球体濾過量（glomerular filtration rate: GFR）は，日本腎臓病学会（2008年）で報告されたものに基づいて，男性の場合はeGFR（mL/分/1.73m2）=194×Cr−1.094×年齢−0.287，女性の場合はeGFR（mL/分/1.73m2）=194×Cr−1.094×年齢−0.287×0.739で算出した。 統計はJMP®11.2.0を使用し，年齢階級別の解析はカイ2乗検定，one–way ANOVAで行い，有意水準は0.05未満とした。 過去5年間の65歳以上の急性薬物中毒の総数は72例，そのうち前期高齢者は31例，後期高齢者は30例，超高齢者は11例であった。主な調査項目の結果をTable 1に示す。年齢中央値は77.0歳，最少年齢65歳，最高年齢95歳，男性28例，女子44例であった。救急車による緊急搬送は50例（69.4%）で，85歳以上では11例全例が救急搬送であり，年齢群別で有意差を認めた（p<0.05）。自殺目的や誤ってなどで自ら過量服薬した故意的要素の症例は40例，偶発的な事故症例は32例であった。前期高齢者では，故意的症例が74.2%と多かったが，超高齢者では事故的症例が72.7%と，高齢になればなるほど事故的要素が有意に増加していた（p<0.05）。

生活背景としては，まず日常生活動作が自立している人は55例，杖歩行や車いす使用が12例，部分介助や寝たきりは5例であった。主に薬剤管理している者は，本人が65例，家族4例，誰が管理しているか不明であったものは4例と，患者自身で内服管理している症例が90.3%と多かった。居住状況は，独居22例，家族と同居44例，施設入居2例，不明4例と家族と同居している症例が61%と最も多かったが，独居も約30.6%を占めていた。定期内服種類数は，前期高齢者4.0種類，後期高齢者5.0種類，超高齢者7.5種類と，高齢になるほど有意に定期内服薬の種類数が多かった（p<0.05）。 主訴は，意識障害35例，脱力11例，ショック8例，傾眠7例，倦怠感7例，心停止，嘔気，食欲低下，焦燥感，特にないというのが各1例と，非特異的な症状であった。 中毒の原因となった薬剤は，ベンゾジアゼピン系などの睡眠薬42例，フェノバルビタール系薬剤8例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬やβ遮断薬が4例，三環系抗うつ薬2例，テオフィリン2例，サリチル酸1例，抗ウイルス薬1例であった。 治療は，経過観察および薬剤中止のみによる自然軽快が64例，ベンゾジアゼピン中毒に対する拮抗薬物の使用3例，アシクロビル中毒やテオフィリン中毒に対する血液透析2例，ジギタリス中毒に対する一時的ペースメーカー留置2例，三環系抗うつ薬中毒に対する心肺蘇生法1例であった。転帰は，入院44例，帰宅28例であり，入院日数の中央値は前期高齢者で3.0日，後期高齢者で4.0日，超高齢者で4.5日であった（p=0.71）。 次に，事故的要素で薬物中毒となった32例の特徴をTable 2に示す。全体での結果と同様に，高齢になるほど定期内服薬の種類数が多いことに有意差を認めたが，それ以外の項目では有意差を認めなかった。生活背景では，日常生活動作が自立している人は20例（62.5%）と多く，主に薬剤管理しているのが本人である症例は28例（87.5%）であった。居住状況は，独居7例，家族と同居22例，施設入居1例，不明2例と家族と同居している症例が最も多かった。事故的症例の独居者の主訴は，本人が嘔気や傾眠を自覚し救急搬送しているものが5例，ヘルパーなどの介護者に倒れているのを発見された意識障害症例は2例であった。中毒の原因となった薬剤は，ベンゾジアゼピン系などの睡眠薬9例，フェノバルビタール系薬剤2例，ジギタリス製剤8例，フェニトイン4例，カルシウム拮抗薬やβ遮断薬が4例，三環系抗うつ薬1例，テオフィリン2例，サリチル酸1例，抗ウイルス薬1例であり，基礎疾患関連の循環器系薬剤の影響が多かった。また，相互作用を起こす内服薬は27例処方されており，その相互作用が今回の主訴と関連した症例は17例であった。2週間前に抗てんかん薬が新規追加された症例，向精神薬やカルシウム拮抗薬が数日前から増量された症例，定期内服が頻回に変更されている症例，各専門診療科受診で非ステロイド性抗炎症薬などが新規追加された症例を認めた。

3。本邦の調査でも，一般病院の入院症例では60歳未満に比べて70歳以上では1.5倍以上の薬物有害事象出現率を示し，高齢者の6～15%に薬物有害事象を認めたとされている 4, 5。その原因として，高齢者においては基礎疾患および年齢に伴う薬物代謝の変化を背景とした“薬の効き過ぎ”と多剤併用（polypharmacy）が重要と認識され，老年病専門医においては，93%で薬物有害事象の予防目的に薬剤を減量・中止することがあると報告 6されている。本検討でも，高齢者の薬物中毒は少なからず認められ，高齢になるほど故意での過量服用より事故要素の薬物中毒が多かった。これは決められた量の処方薬を飲んでいるだけにもかかわらず，血中濃度が高値になってしまう場合であり，今回この事故的要素の薬物中毒に焦点をあて，誘因を調査し，薬物側因子と患者側因子に分けた。まず薬物側因子では高齢になるほど定期内服薬の種類および数が多くなること，基礎疾患に対する処方薬が増えるため定期内服薬自体に相互作用を起こすものが多くなること，新たな疾患に対して各専門診療科でそれぞれ新規薬剤が追加されること，有効血中濃度域と中毒域が比較的狭い薬剤の使用が多いことが挙げられる。患者側因子は，年齢とともに徐々に肝機能や心機能，腎機能が低下してくること，発熱や経口摂取不良により脱水になりやすいこと，骨密度低下による筋骨格系の受診歴が増加し非ステロイド性抗炎症剤などの鎮痛剤使用があること，これらの相互的作用によりさらなる腎機能障害が出現することである。また，薬物側因子と患者側因子が重複した場合，決められた量や種類を誤って服用したりすることで，少量の薬剤でも重篤な症状となり得る。 高齢者の薬剤有害事象を未然に防ぐ処方基準として欧米ではBeers criteria 7, 8が広く知られている。65歳以上の高齢患者を対象として，「高齢患者において疾患・病態によらず一般に使用を避けることが望ましい薬剤」と「高齢患者における特定の疾患・病態において使用を避けることが望ましい薬剤」が載っており，その日本版 9も呈示されている。しかしながら，Beers criteriaに挙げられている一般不適切薬よりも，ワーファリン，インスリンといった薬のほうが，有害事象による救急医療を要する割合が約35倍にも上るという報告 10もあり，その問題点が指摘されている。我が国における薬物有害事象を未然に防ぐ取り組みとしては，医薬分業制度があり，薬剤師が介入することにより患者の服薬管理が整えば，複数の医療機関からの重複投薬をチェックでき，副作用の防止につながる。この制度は2003年に初めて全国の医薬分業率（外来で処方箋を受け取った患者のうち，院外の薬局で調剤を受けた割合）が50%を超えており，今後もさらなる拡大が望まれる。また本検討では，原因薬剤は睡眠薬系が最も多かったが，循環器系や抗てんかん薬など基礎疾患関連の薬剤，特に事故症例に限定すると循環器系薬剤の影響が多く，より重篤な症状を呈し治療介入を要していた。このような重篤な有害事象が起こっていることを，日々病診連携で情報提供しあうことが大切である。 その他の結果として，若年者より総数は少ないが，自殺目的による薬物過量服用は高齢者でも散見されること，認知機能の低下により内服薬の種類や量を誤って服用してしまう症例があった。 救急臨床現場では，本人からの情報聴取が困難な場合や現場状況の情報がない場合に意識障害やショック，脱力などの原因として薬物中毒も鑑別に挙げなければならない。特に重篤となるのは，尿中薬物スクリーニングキットで検出可能な睡眠薬や抗うつ薬よりも，検出されない循環器系薬剤や抗てんかん薬であり，独居高齢者の死亡の原因になり得る。 本論文の全著者に，規定されたCOIはない。

Hastalığın erken aşamaları klasik olarak bellekteki zayıflama ile ilişkilidir. Hastalığın erken evresinde bireyler kelime bulmakta, yeni insanların isimlerini hatırlamakta ve sosyal/iş görevlerinde zorluk yaşamaktadırlar. Beraberinde son günlerde okuduğu yazıyı unutma ve nesneleri yanlış yerleştirme gibi sorunlar görülebilmektedir. Hastalık ilerledikçe orta evrede önemli olayları veya kişisel anıları unutmak, sosyal geri çekilme, adres veya telefon numaralarını hatırlayamama, zaman ve yer oryantasyonunda bozulma, mevsime/ortama uygun kıyafet seçememe, uyku düzeni değişiklikleri, gezinme veya kaybolma riski, kişilik veya davranış değişiklikleri (şüphe, dürtüsellik, sanrılar ve tekrarlayan davranışlar) görülmektedir. Alzheimer hastalığının neden olduğu bu sorunların sona erdirilmesi için erken tanı, tedavi ve özellikle de önlenmesine yönelik çeşitli yaklaşımlara gereksinim vardır. Teknolojinin de ilerlemesiyle dünyada ve ülkemizde çalışmaların artmasına rağmen hastalığın önlenmesi ve kesin tedavisi henüz mümkün olmamaktadır. Ancak Alzheimer hastalığına sahip yaşlı bireylerin günlük yaşam aktivitelerine katılımı ve yaşam kalitesinin artırılabilmesi için ilaç tedavisinin yanı sıra özellikle hastalığın belirtilerini azaltmakta ilaç dışı yöntemler de uygulanmaktadır. &#x0D; Bu derleme, farmakolojik tedavinin yanı sıra Alzheimer hastalarının semptomlarını azaltmak ve yaşam kalitesini artırmak için kullanılabilecek geleneksel ve destekleyici yöntemlerin hemşireler ve diğer sağlık profesyonellerine yol göstermesini amaçlamaktadır.",

      "abstract": "Stress is the body’s automatic response to any physical or mental demand placed on it. It is subjective and unpleasant felling of distress. Every one of us irrespective of our age, sex, education, occupation, socio-economic status, whether live in rural or urban area face stress.Stress effect body, mind, behavior in many ways and everyone experiences stress differently. It adversely effect a wide range of health condition and yoga is the most comprehensive approach to fighting stress. When we are in stress our nervous system respond by releasing a flood of stress hormone. This hormone stimulates the body for emergency action by “fight-flight or freeze” reaction also known as stress response. The agent which causes stress is known as ‘stressors’. Stress causes many harmful effect on the body such as , Physical impact - Weight gain/loss, Unexpected hair loss, Heart palpitations, High blood pressure, Digestive symptoms (such as dryness of mouth, flatulence, nausea, butterfly stomach)etc. Emotional negative effect includes Mood swing, Anxiety, Can lead to depression & unhealthy coping strategies (i.e. alcohol, drugs).",

      "abstract": "Introduccion. La estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) es un tratamiento muy efectivo para las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, pero como todo procedimiento neuroquirurgico intracerebral no esta libre de complicaciones. Objetivo. Revision bibliografica sobre las complicaciones de la ECP en la EP. Desarrollo. Las complicaciones de la ECP ocurren en todas las etapas del procedimiento: antes, durante y despues de la cirugia (en el postoperatorio inmediato y remoto). En la precirugia el aspecto mas importante es la seleccion del candidato apropiado, no solo referido a beneficio sintomatico, sino tambien en cuanto a conocer su estado cognitivo y comorbilidades. Durante la cirugia la complicacion mas grave y temida es la hemorragia cerebral. En el postoperatorio las complicaciones pueden relacionarse con la intervencion (por ejemplo, sindrome confusional en el postoperatorio inmediato), con la estimulacion (contracciones musculares tonicas, desviacion ocular, midriasis, hipersudoracion hemicorporal, empeoramiento de la acinesia, alteraciones de determinadas areas cognitivas o conductuales), con el sistema implantado (rotura de electrodos, desconexion, desplazamientos, infecciones), con cambios en la medicacion (por ejemplo, depresion) o con cambios en la funcionalidad y otras de origen desconocido (como aumento de peso). Conclusion. La ECP mejora la discapacidad y la calidad de vida de la EP avanzada, pero conlleva complicaciones o efectos adversos. Conocer estas complicaciones contribuye a minimizarlas y al perfeccionamiento de la tecnica.",

      "abstract": "Objetivo: Analisar as características do Transtorno de Estresse Pós-Traumático (TEPT). Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Oral-facial-digital syndrome type I (OFD1) is usually male lethal during gestation and predominantly affects females. OFD1 is characterized by the following features: Oral (lobulated tongue, tongue nodules, cleft of the hard or soft palate, accessory gingival frenulae, hypodontia, and other dental abnormalities) Facial (widely spaced eyes or telecanthus, hypoplasia of the alae nasi, median cleft or pseudocleft upper lip, micrognathia) Digital (brachydactyly, syndactyly, clinodactyly of the fifth finger; duplicated hallux [great toe]) Kidney (polycystic kidney disease) Brain (e.g., intracerebral cysts, agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar agenesis with or without Dandy-Walker malformation) Intellectual disability (in ~50% of individuals) Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of OFD1 is established in a proband by identification of an OFD1 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Surgery for cleft lip/palate, tongue nodules, accessory frenulae, and syndactyly; removal of accessory teeth and orthodontia for malocclusion; routine treatment for renal disease and seizures. Speech therapy and special education may be warranted. Surveillance: Annual audiology evaluation and assessment of speech development in children if cleft lip and/or cleft palate is present. Individuals age ten years and older: annual blood pressure examination, serum creatinine, annual ultrasound examination for renal, hepatic, pancreatic, and ovarian cystic disease. Genetic counseling OFD1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately 75% of affected individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., with no family history of OFD1). A female proband with OFD1 may have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; the proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown. The risk that the unaffected mother of an affected female who is a simplex case will give birth to another female with OFD1 is less than 1%. At conception, the risk to the offspring of females with OFD1 of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%; however, most male conceptuses with the pathogenic variant miscarry. Thus, at delivery the expected sex ratio of offspring is: 33% unaffected females; 33% affected females; 33% unaffected males. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known. Prenatal ultrasound examination may detect structural brain malformations and/or duplication of the hallux.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Inappropriate use of benzodiazepines is an important public health problem. In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Patients with idiopathic parkinsonism suffer from a neurodegenerative disorder of the nervous system. Due to a progressive loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) develop problems with motor and non-motor functions. On the motor level the dysfunctions defect the voluntary movements and lead to symptoms like: rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia [1]. On the level of cognition PD patients have problems with the executive functions, cognitive flexibility, working memory and control of attention [2]. Furthermore, the speech system gets affected which often leads to dysarthric speech. This hypokinetic dysarthria impacts the phonation, articulation and the respiratory system. The speech deficits include monoloudness, monopitch, reduced stress, imprecise articulation, variability of speech rate, disfluencies and voice tremor [3, 4, 5].PD affects communication as well as other related functions such as cognition, but complex prosodic aspects such as focus marking are less well studied. Prominence marking in German requires changes in intonation and articulation [6]. Speakers use multiple cues in the phonetic domain to regulate prosodic marking [7], e.g. modulation of F0 and syllable duration. Furthermore, there is insufficient literature on the impact of cognition on these phonetic aspects of prominence marking. The aim of this study is to analyse how prosodic prominence correlates with motoric and cognitive abilities in patients with Parkinson’s disease in the complex process of speech production.",

      "title": "Designation of a new drug as a controlled substance",
      "abstract": "Opioids are widely used as painkillers and anesthetics. Though we use opioids to relieve pain, these drugs can induce mood elevation, dependency, and withdrawal symptoms. This is why opioids are controlled-substances. Most physicians think that some substances should be controlled if they have opioid-like pharmacological properties, especially a long duration, preservation of respiration, and dependency. It is noteworthy that short-acting substances, such as midazolam and thiopental, are included in controlled substances. Their abuse is very dangerous because they frequently induce severe respiratory depression due to a narrow therapeutic window. Teaching point of this article is that designation of a new drug as a controlled substance requires scientific evidence of its link to dependency and/or withdrawal symptoms. However, this does not require abusers' convenience (long duration) or safety (maintenance of respiration). The authors present the addiction and abuse patterns of propofol as an reasons for the Korean Food and Drug Administration to designate propofol as a controlled substance. As a future study, an animal and/or a clinical model for dependency is needed to identify addictive substances. Though several neurotransmitters and their loci in the central nervous system have been studied, the precise mechanism for addiction is unknown. Also, it should be recognized that the potential for drug addiction and abuse could be masked in the early marketing period of a new drug. Physicians should monitor patients' responses carefully when they deal with the drug.",

      "title": "OxyContin® Abuse and Overdose",
      "abstract": "AbstractBackground: OxyContin® (controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride) (Purdue Pharma, Stamford, CT) was approved in 1995 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for moderate-to-severe chronic pain. Crushing and snorting the delayed-release tablets results in a rapid release of the drug, increased absorption, and high peak serum concentrations. The propensity for addiction to OxyContin® and the trend of increased prescription drug abuse have made it imperative for physicians and health care providers to recognize the clinical presentation of overdose and know how to manage associated complications. Objectives: In this review of OxyContin®, we discuss current trends in its abuse and the clinical presentation of overdose. We review the specific effects of the drug on body systems and the recognition of symptomatology, differential diagnosis, and management. Discussion: Many of the clinical findings in acute opioid overdoses are nonspecific, making diagnosis difficult. OxyContin® overdose presents with a typical opiate toxidrome, including decreased respirations, miosis, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The presence of coingestants can cloud the clinical picture. If OxyContin® overdose is suspected, early ventilation and oxygenation should be administered, which is generally sufficient to prevent death. Even in the absence of a confirmation, cautious administration of naloxone–the opiate receptor antagonist and antidote for opioid overdoses–may have both diagnostic and therapeutic effects. Summary: With increasing rates of prescription drug abuse, OxyContin® will continue to present challenges to physicians and health care providers. Physicians should be aware of potential patients who are seeking OxyContin® for recreational use.Keywords: OxyContin®addictionsubstance abuseoverdoseopioid",

El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento. El propósito de esta revisión es clarificar criterios diagnósticos, y exponer un manejo progresivo de enfrentamiento y tratamiento, con un enfoque multidisciplinario, sin ahondar en la resolución de las causas médicas orgánicas.",

At the same time, some specific epileptic syndromes were indicated by the eponym of the first physician who originally described the condition (e.g., West syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome) or by some characteristic clinical features (e.g., nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, absence epilepsy, epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females). In many of these occurrences, the distinct epileptic syndrome was defined mainly by its most relevant clinical feature (e.g., seizure semiology), associated comorbidities, and electroencephalographic patterns.[3] [4]",

Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

Compared with placebo, treatment with imipramine hydrochloride in a multiple crossover design using threeweek treatment periods led to improved performance on the memory task without either clinically apparent improvement in depression or significantly improved performance on the other tasks. These results may reflect the relative complexity of the memory task rather than a specific impairment of short-term memory, but the data do support the presence of cognitive dysfunction in depression, even in ambulatory patients without substantial impairments of attention or motor functioning. The results also indicate that antidepressant drugs can produce improvement in cognitive function, possibly as a forerunner of clinical improvement.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is without a doubt one of the most ancient and enigmatic conditions in the history of medicine, as it was already described in remote times. From the ancestral obscure understanding of epilepsy to the present, there have been important scientific advances in the knowledge of its diagnosis and treatment. The management of a child with epilepsy requires following a protocol that includes a detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation. All chronic diseases, and also epilepsy, are felt as a double aggression: 1) Internal, related to the changes that the disease causes, and 2) external, related to the tests, medications, excessive protection, and all the rules and prohibitions that are applied. The doctor (pediatrician, pediatric neurologist or epileptologist), when initiating a relationship with the child with epilepsy, is going to propose \"a new code\", often hard to accept. He is going to intervene far away from the crisis, or soon after it happened, in an environment characterized by significant anguish for the family. There is no question that the disease is difficult for the child, as it is also for the parents, who become responsible for a different type of care, are preoccupied daily about their son taking the medication regularly, and suffer awaiting for another crisis to happen. Epilepsy, more than other conditions, creates a high level of restlessness because of the spectacular, dramatic nature of its presentation and for the ancestral myths still attributed to it. For all these reasons, the diagnosis of epilepsy is frequently accompanied by three relevant reactions in the family: anxiety, guilt and aggressiveness. The intervention of the doctor in the treatment of childhood epilepsy must be \"global\". With mystic devotion, the doctor must embrace the true Hippocratic concept of patient care.",

The order of decreasing chronic toxicity is: neuroleptics, antidepressants, anxiolytics. Each class of psychotropic drugs has a specific toxicological problem. With anxiolytics the major problems stem from their misuse and overuse. With neuroleptics tardive dyskinesia is a serious threat to longterm therapy. Finally, antidepressants are characterized by a low therapeutic index and a resulting high incidence of severe and fatal poisoning cases, both intentional and accidental.",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

We report two cases of neurologic complications requiring hospitalization in patients when atomoxetine was added to other psychoactive drugs. A 9-year-old taking clonidine and dextroamphetamine developed psychosis, abnormal involuntary movements, and insomnia. An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first.

      "abstract": "Tapering medication is difficult for many patients using chronic medication. Physicians must be aware of why patients experience difficulties in discontinuation. Important are the cognitions of patients about why the medication is necessary, for example because of the deficit of a certain substance that is supplemented by the medication. Or a too favourable expectation of the effect while time-to-benefit has passed. The experience of withdrawal effects during earlier attempts or the experience of dependency hamper new attempts to stop. This is important in medication that induces physical dependency: antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or proton pump inhibitors. Fear for relapse is also hampering discontinuation; this is at stake in patients with psychosis, depression and epilepsy. Finally, poor communication and not having a trusted professional are impediments for discontinuation. To be successful in helping patients discontinue their medication professionals must communicate well about the patient's personal attitude, experience, emotions, and life circumstances as well as to possess expertise about the technical aspects of the procedure of stopping medication.",

Les troubles de l'accommodation representent un effet indesirable oculaire, souvent mentionne dans les resumes des caracteristiques des medicaments. Ils peuvent se manifester de plusieurs facons, allant d'un simple inconfort en vision de loin ou de pres a des symptomes plus marques tels qu'une fatigue oculaire ou des cephalees. On definit les troubles de l'accommodation soit par : -­ Une perte ou une paralysie de l'accommodation qui s'explique par une gene ou une incapacite a lire de pres sans correction. Il s'agit d'une atteinte du muscle ciliaire et/ou a une mydriase par stimulation du nerf sympathique ou par inhibition du systeme parasympathique. -­ Un spasme d'accommodation a l'origine d'une myopie transitoire. Cela s'explique par la contraction permanente du muscle ciliaire et s'associe, en cas d'origine medicamenteuse, a un myosis par stimulation excessive du systeme parasympathique. Les medicaments parasympathomimetiques induisent ainsi un myosis actif, et les medicaments parasympatholytiques une mydriase passive. A l'inverse, les medicaments sympathomimetiques alpha-­adrenergiques provoquent une mydriase active, et les medicaments sympatholytiques alpha-­adrenergiques un myosis passif.

Le pharmacien est un acteur important dans la prise en charge des patients. Il permet, grâce a ses conseils, d'accompagner le patient en matiere d'effets indesirables et de lui signaler leur survenue eventuelle en matiere de vision. Afin de mieux maitriser les risques de troubles de l'accommodation, le pharmacien doit garder une formation continue, et etre vigilant quant aux risques que comporte chaque molecule commercialisee.",

      "title": "Opioid withdrawal symptoms, a consequence of chronic opioid use and opioid use disorder: Current understanding and approaches to management",
      "abstract": "What is known and objective Opioid use in the United States has reached unprecedented—some would even say crisis—levels. Although many individuals use opioid drugs as part of legitimate pain management plans, a significant number misuse prescription or illicit opioids. With regular opioid use, individuals develop tolerance and physical dependence; both are predictable, physiologic responses to repeated opioid exposure. However, a substantial number of individuals who misuse opioids will develop opioid use disorder (OUD), a complex, primary, chronic, neurobiological disease rooted in genetic, environmental and psychosocial factors. This article discusses OUD, opioid receptor physiology, and opioid withdrawal symptomatology and pathophysiology, as well as current treatment options available to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms in individuals with physical dependence and/or OUD. Methods The research articles regarding OUD and its management have been reviewed thoroughly based on a PubMed literature search using keywords related to opioid dependence, its pathophysiology and current treatment strategies. Results and discussion Tolerance/physical dependence and the behavioural characteristics associated with OUD reflect complex neurobiologic adaptations in several major systems of the brain, including the locus ceruleus and mesolimbic systems. Physical dependence is responsible for the distressing withdrawal symptoms individuals experience upon abrupt cessation or rapid dose reduction of exogenous opioids. Opioid withdrawal symptoms are a key driver behind continued opioid use, and a barrier to opioid discontinuation. Several opioid-based medications are available to treat patients with OUD; these treatments can diminish opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings as well as block opioid effects in the event of relapse. Additionally, non-opioid drugs may be used during acute detoxification to help alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms. What is new and conclusion The opioid crisis has produced many challenges for physicians, one being the need to determine which patients would benefit most from maintenance therapy and which may be candidates for opioid discontinuation. In addition to summarizing current understanding of OUD, we provide a new algorithm for determining the need for continued opioid use as well as examples of situations where management of opioid withdrawal symptoms is indicated.",

      "abstract": "As Parkinson's disease progresses, fluctuations between akinesia, or hypomobility (\"off\" times), and mobility (\"on\" times) increase in frequency despite optimized pharmacotherapy. Motor fluctuations include predictable shortening of therapeutic effects, nocturnal or early morning akinesia, random hypomobility, and delayed mobility (variable responses to individual doses of drugs). Current oral antiparkinson drugs are inadequate for rapid and consistent relief of symptoms during hypomobility. Apomorphine, an injectable dopamine agonist recently introduced in the United States, is indicated for the management of hypomobility associated with advanced Parkinson's disease. Subcutaneous apomorphine is effective for rapid and consistent rescue from hypomobility, with a magnitude of motor improvement similar to that of levodopa. The effect begins within 20 minutes after dosing and lasts approximately 100 minutes. Therapeutic rescue doses are 2-6 mg, and patients typically require approximately three rescue doses/day. Apomorphine is associated with a clinically significant potential to cause nausea and orthostatic hypotension. These potential effects can be managed with antiemetic prophylaxis and appropriate determination of the therapeutic rescue dose.",

      "abstract": "Several factors contribute to the transition from recreational to compulsive use of opiates, as well as other drugs of abuse.This change is due to the positive reinforcing characteristic of the drug, found in the initial stages of its use, and subsequently due to its negative reinforcing characteristic achieved after its chronic ingestion, when the drug is ingested as a way of relieving the unpleasant symptoms generated by each time their consumption is stopped.In addicted individuals, the desire for the drug, evoked either by contextual cues or by the context itself (craving), and abstinence, strongly contribute to the maintenance of its consumption and relapse after a period of abstinence.The brain reward system plays a major role in modulating these behaviors.In this system, opioids such as morphine, which naturally induce euphoria and a feeling of relaxation, among other effects, also have the property of inducing their search and consumption, after a long period of use.Consequently, this drug can potently modulate associative processes linked to memory and learning, and greatly strengthen the memory associated with the context related to the reinforcing effects of the drug, a phenomenon that underlies its compulsive search, even in the face of its notably adverse consequences.The conditioning technique of preference to the place can be used to simulate the development of a state of dependence, including the phases of acquisition, extinction and reinstatement, which highlights its importance in the evaluation of the effects of morphine, and others drugs, in chronic addiction.This preference may result from electrophysiological changes in brain areas linked to the control of the motivational response, which would be expressed in the body's ability to filter sensory stimuli from the environment that are not relevant, either during the expression of motivated behaviors related to the drug or the extinction of these.memoirs.Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) can be modified by associative learning when compensatory responses learned based on abstinence and drug relapse appear.However, although the late cognitive and attentional modulation of sensory information processing has been extensively studied, the pre-attentive mechanisms that occur in the early stages of sensory information processing related to the effect of drugs and their association with the context remain largely unexplored.In order to assess the possible electrophysiological changes, both early (inferior colliculus) and late (pre-limbic cortex) concomitant with the expression of preference conditioned to the place induced by morphine and to understand the influence of the opioid system in the initial stages of auditory information, we elaborated a series of five experiments in which the abilities of morphine were tested, in different doses, in producing, preference, aversion, behavioral tolerance and physiological tolerance, using a conditioned preference procedure.These results show that, despite the absence of behavioral events, a short-term administration of a low dose of morphine can change the information processing of sensory auditory stimulus in the CIC early.In addition, much of the effects of morphine result in behavioral and electrophysiological tolerance.These data indicate that, even in the absence of behavioral manifestations, the appearance of compensatory potential evoked potentials may signal the first step in the development of drug addiction.",

      "title": "Cytokines as a Precipitant of Depressive Illness: Animal and Human Studies",
      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

      "title": "Continuing Clozapine Therapy Despite Morning Pseudoneutropenia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent with demonstrated effectiveness for patients with psychoses that are refractory to treatment with other antipsychotic drugs.1,2 Clozapine is not recommended as first-line therapy for schizophrenia because of its side effects, which include agranulocytosis (0.5% to 2.0% of patients receiving the drug), seizures, weight gain, glucose and lipid disturbances, sedation, sialorrhea, hypotension, and tachycardia.2,3 A trial of clozapine is recommended if there is suboptimal response to adequate trials of antipsychotics from 2 different classes and for patients who cannot tolerate the side effects of other antipsychotic agents.1,2 Clozapine may induce 2 distinct types of neutropenia. The milder form occurs more frequently (in 1.5% to 2% of patients receiving the drug).3,4 The exact mechanism of this form of neutropenia is unknown, but it is thought to be due to the premature destruction of neutrophils in the blood or spleen.3,4 Recovery from this type occurs rapidly, within 3 to 7 days after drug discontinuation, since myeloid maturation in the bone marrow is unaffected. The second type is more severe, manifesting as agranulocytosis, but occurs less frequently (0.8% cumulative incidence at 3 years of treatment). With this form, there is selective depletion of the granulocyte precursors in the bone marrow, and recovery may take from 14 to 22 days.4,5 These patients are at risk of neutropenic sepsis. The risks of morbidity and mortality associated with agranulocytosis necessitate a strict hematologic monitoring program for patients receiving clozapine. Each of the 3 Canadian manufacturers of this drug coordinates a national registry and monitoring program for patients. The risk of agranulocytosis is greatest during the first 6 months of treatment; therefore, weekly assessment of leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count is essential to ensure that the values remain above 3.5 x 109/L and 2.0 x 109/L, respectively. After 6 months of therapy, the frequency of monitoring is reduced to every 2 weeks.2 The 3 clozapine monitoring programs generate alerts that are identified by colour: green, yellow, and red. A patient is deemed to be in the green zone, and blood tests are obtained weekly, if the leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts are above the stated minimum values (3.5 x 109/L and 2.0 x 109/L, respectively). A patient is deemed to be in the yellow zone if the leukocyte count is between 2.0 x 109/L and 3.5 x 109/L or the absolute neutrophil count is between 1.5 x 109/L and 2.0 x 109/L, or if a significant decline in either count (i.e., a single decrease or sum of decreases in leukocyte count of at least 3.0 x 109/L or in absolute neutrophil count of at least 1.5 x 109/L) occurs over a 4-week period; for these patients, leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts must be determined twice weekly until the counts return to green zone values. If neutropenia occurs (defined as leukocyte count below 2.0 x 109/L or absolute neutrophil count below 1.5 x 109/L), the patient is deemed to be in the red zone, and clozapine is discontinued with no opportunity for reinitiation. “Morning pseudoneutropenia”, or diurnal variation in absolute neutrophil count that necessitates afternoon monitoring of both leukocyte and neutrophil counts, has been reported during clozapine therapy.1,6-10 We describe 2 patients for whom multiple antipsychotic trials had failed and clozapine therapy was initiated. In both patients, hematologic monitoring revealed a pattern of diurnal variation in the absolute neutrophil count. Without close monitoring to detect these trends, the patients might have been classified as being in the yellow zone or perhaps the red zone, which would have led to frequent blood sampling or even discontinuation of therapy. By identifying the diurnal variation, we were able to continue therapy for these treatment-refractory patients.",

Caracteriza-se por uma alteração aguda no estado mental, com prejuízo da atenção, cognição e consciência, e pode ser causado por disfunções orgânicas, intoxicação ou abstinência de substâncias. Fatores predisponentes incluem doenças neurológicas como Parkinson e Alzheimer, idade avançada, déficits sensoriais, e o uso de medicamentos neuropsiquiátricos. Já fatores precipitantes envolvem disfunções renais e hepáticas, infecções e o uso de certos medicamentos, como sedativos e opióides. O delirium pode ser classificado em três tipos: hiperativo, hipoativo e misto. O tratamento geralmente envolve a abordagem das causas subjacentes e intervenções não farmacológicas, como reorientação cognitiva e mobilização precoce. Porém, a condição também pode acarretar sequelas duradouras, com impacto na mortalidade, tempo de internação e custos hospitalares. O termo \"delirium\" tem origem no latim \"delirare\", que significa \"estar fora do caminho\", e foi integrado formalmente à psiquiatria no DSM-III, em 1980. O diagnóstico precoce é facilitado por ferramentas como o CAM-ICU e a ICDSC, enquanto intervenções ambientais, como controle de luz e som, também são essenciais para o manejo da condição.",

Optimizing management of chronic or acute pain in such patients can be challenging. Substance abuse and addiction to a variety of illicit substances (marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines) is an increasing problem, with opioids being the most commonly abused. An understanding of the prevalence of this condition, as well as changes in opioid receptor function in the opioid-tolerant patient, facilitates effective treatment. There are several strategies to treat patients in this population effectively.",

      "abstract": "Varying resistance to psychotherapy occurred in patients fantasying that the rapid removal of depressions was effected by a “miracle drug” which could be relied upon for “magical” solutions to future problems. Most patients easily transferred their desires for assistance from the medication to the psychotherapist who prescribed it (and might possibly have to do so again). The administration of adrenocorticosteroids, however, may result in undesirable complications. The medical contraindications to steroid therapy must be heeded, and constant watchfulness for the possible development of harmful physical side-effects is essential. Psychiatric and neurologic disturbances may follow the administration of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropin( 4, 5). A too rapid tapering of steroid dosage may result in a period of relative hypoadrenalism, thereby exacerbating and compounding psychiatric difficulties(5). During this study, reappearance of severe depressions occurred in 1 manicdepressive and 2 neurotic-depressives, in each case about 2 months after the discontinuation of medication. These relapses may indicate the necessity for maintaining the recovered depressive patient on small doses of steroids for periods approximating the average duration of previous phases of severe depression. In this study the rapid relief of depressive symptomatology afforded by therapy with prednisone accentuated the patients’ basic personality problems. In schizo-affectives, adequate doses of phenothiazines were needed to treat the intensification of psychotic thought disorders which began concurrently with the remission of depression. The treatment of patients having involutional psychotic depressions with some paranoid features likewise required phenothiazines to suppress the paranoid thought disorders which replaced their affective disorders.",

Diffuse paroxysmal discharges in the EEG appeared when the patient was blinking in darkness or in bright light.

During intermittent photic stimulation the epileptic discharges were accompanied by myoclonic jerks. The act of beginning to speak was linked with spontaneous blinking and EEG changes and was accompanied consistently by seizures. These were characterized by a peculiar stuttering and an absencelike impairment of consciousness. Seizures have been controlled well using clonazepam and valproic acid.",

There is an increased risk of traumatic injury resulting in hospitalization among substance users. An awareness of and a high index of suspicion about drug use must pervade all aspects of practice, especially assessment. Pharmacotherapy is available for opiates, alcohol and nicotine. Substance users are heterogeneous, no single approach is universally effective, and evaluation of treatment outcome should be multidimensional.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape.

      "abstract": "Acute intermittent porphyria mimics a variety of commonly occurring disorders and thus poses a diagnostic quagmire. Psychiatric manifestations include hysteria, anxiety, depression, phobias, psychosis, organic disorders, agitation, delirium, and altered consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma. Some patients develop psychosis similar to schizophrenia. Psychiatric hospitals have a disproportionate number of patients with this disorder as only difficult and resistant patients accumulate there. Presence of photosensitive porphyrins in the urine is diagnostic. When porphyrins are absent, excess of alpha aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen are present in the urine. The definitive test is to measure monopyrrole porphobilinogen deaminase in RBCs. This diagnosis should be entertained in the following situations: (a) unexplained leukocytosis; (b) unexplained neuropathy; (c) etiologically obscure neurosis or psychosis; (d) 'idiopathic' seizure disorder; (e) unexplained abdominal pain; (f) conversion hysteria, and (g) susceptibility to stress. Porphyria is important in psychiatry as it may present with only psychiatric symptoms; it may masquerade as a psychosis and the patient may be treated as a schizophrenic person for years; the only manifestation may be histrionic personality disorder which may not receive much attention. Diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion and appropriate investigation. Various psychotropic drugs exacerbate acute attacks. While it is important not to use the unsafe drugs in porphyric patients, it is also imperative to look for this diagnosis in cases where these drugs produce unprecedented drug reactions.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Over the past few decades, the use of opioids in the management of chronic pain conditions has greatly increased. As opioid utilization has expanded, so has the recognition of associated hormonal derangements. These hormonal disturbances involve disruption, predominantly of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and can affect both men and women treated with opioids. The best recognized of these hormonal disorders is opioid-associated androgen deficiency. Opioid-associated androgen deficiency is most likely to occur with prolonged, high-dose opioid therapy and may be associated with the development of other conditions such as depression, osteoporosis and possible hyperalgesia. Once identified, opioid-associated androgen deficiency should be managed with appropriate hormonal replacement therapy and patients should be closely monitored for adequacy of treatment and treatment-associated adverse events.",

      "title": "Interventions for the Prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Sudden Unexplained Death in Infancy: A Review of Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under the age of one (i.e., death for which a cause is not found even after a thorough investigation including review of clinical history, examination of death scene and a complete autopsy). Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) also known as Sudden unexplained infant death is a term used to describe sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant for which external risk factors may be present. SUDI is a blanket term that encompasses SIDS, other unexplained infant deaths, and explained infant suffocations. SIDS and SUDI are not diagnoses. Risk factors for SIDS fall under three groups: intrinsic risk factors (e.g., male sex, prematurity, exposure to cigarette smoke), extrinsic risk factors (e.g., prone or side sleep position, bed sharing, overheating) and exogenous factors (e.g., ethnicity, climate, geographical location). It has been shown that racial and ethnic disparities (such as Indigenous peoples and other racial minorities) and vulnerabilities (such as low socioeconomic status, fewer social supports, those experiencing problems with housing, violence or mental illness) may contribute to increased risk of SIDS.,In Canada, the incidence of SUDI was the highest in 1980 with a rate of 2.07 SUDI per 1,000 live births. The rates of SUDI and SIDS have since decreased, especially since the 1990s. In 2018, there were ten deaths classified as SIDS in Canada. A global decrease in the incidence of SIDS can be attributed to widespread “Back-to-Sleep” campaigns, which were aimed to promote placing babies in a supine position for sleeping., Several similar risk reduction strategies, primarily focused on sleep position, have been implemented globally with the aim of reducing the incidence of SIDS and SUDI., The “Back-to-sleep” campaign was later expanded to the “Safe-to-sleep” campaign in 2012 to involve new and evolved evidence for preventing SIDS. As a result of continued research, guidelines regarding the prevention of SIDS and SUDI have been developed and updated throughout the last three decades.A previous CADTH Summary of Abstracts report, published in 2016, briefly summarized evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of SIDS. The purpose of this report is to summarize and critically appraise evidence-based guidelines that were published within the last five years regarding interventions for the prevention of SIDS or SUDI.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

      "abstract": "Disulfiram is used in alcohol rehabilitation because it inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and consequently causes the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (vomiting, vertigo, anxiety, cardiovascular effects) after ingestion of alcoholic beverages. However, adverse effects on the central nervous system (for the most part psychotic reactions, acute organic brain syndrome, catatonia) may appear as a direct result of the drug itself. Disulfiram and its metabolite carbon disulfide inhibit dopamine beta-hydroxylase, increasing the levels of dopamine and reducing those of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. We observed direct disulfiram-induced toxicity on the central nervous system in 8 abstinent patients in whom a disulfiram-ethanol reaction had been excluded. Risk is increased when 1) excessive amounts of the drug are ingested; 2) the patient is already suffering from a major psychiatric illness; 3) the patient has anatomical brain lesions. In all cases observed, the toxic effects appeared in the first weeks and were reversed after suspension of the drug (except in one patient who died from severe bronchopulmonary infection). We thus suggest the following protocol: 1) physical examination and interview 3-4 weeks after initiation of treatment; 2) as a general rule, in abstinent patients, the lowest possible maintenance dosage should be administered. This strategy, despite the risk of underdosage, meets the goals inherent in an integrated medical and psychosocial approach to the treatment of alcoholism with which these patients seem better able to comply.",

Neurological complications increase the length of ICU and hospital stay, and reduce the likelihood of return to independent living. Minor neurological complications are very common and often go undiagnosed. It is now recognized that transient and early postoperative problems such as confusion, agitation, and delirium – previously considered self-limiting nuisances – are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a decline in cognitive function in the early postoperative period is predictive of late (five-year) cognitive decline. General considerations Clinical spectrum The spectrum of central nervous system injury during and after cardiac surgery encompasses a wide range of clinical entities ranging from death or persistent vegetative state to subtle changes in memory and concentration: Neurological injury may be: immediate – apparent soon after the patient recovers from anaesthesia; or delayed – with onset after a...",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is a form of anxiety disorder which is poorly known in children and manifests as a series of symptoms occurring after an extraordinary event outside the range of usual human experiences and responsible for a feeling of terror. Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

The state of ebriety is a poor incentive to precise neurologic analysis and follow-up. Nevertheless, only such surveillance in acute intoxication can distinguish a specific neurological complication, a complication following a fall or prolonged immobilisation, or rapid decompensation of alcoholic encephalopathy. Among the specific complications, myopathies and strokes are described here because of their rarity compared to the more common epilepsy and withdrawal syndromes. The neurologic semiology of ebriety is reviewed, including recent pathophysiological acquisitions specifying the mechanism of functional disorders in regions susceptible to alcohol such as the cerebellum and the reticular formation.",

      "abstract": "Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder present from childhood and often following individuals into adulthood. It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

An awareness and understanding of their potential effects on the central nervous system and their interactions with psychotropic agents is important in the evaluation of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms in patients. Since the introduction of antibiotic agents in the 1930s, numerous (primarily anecdotal) reports have appeared describing psychiatric side effects ranging from anxiety and panic to major depression, psychosis, and delirium in patients with and without a premorbid psychiatric history. Risk factors have included prior psychopathology, coexisting medical conditions, slow acetylator status, advanced age, concomitant medications, and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, as well as high antibiotic dosage and intrathecal or intravenous administration. Psychiatric toxicity may result from various mechanisms of action, including antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid or pyridoxine, adverse interactions with alcohol, or inhibition of protein synthesis. Adverse pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between antibiotics and concomitant medications including lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, valproate, neuroleptics, antidepressants, methadone, and disulfiram have also been reported. Because such effects are often not recognized by clinicians, accurate epidemiologic data on their incidence are not available.",

Making a correct diagnosis can be difficult as patients most often turn for help in the depression phase; they also tend to interpret the hypomania phase as a state of very good mood and increased creativity, not identifying it with the disease. A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it. The case report presented herein shows the difficulties in diagnosing severe cognitive disorders during a depressive episode in the course of BPAD and the difficulties in differentiating between them and dementia, as well as presents the effects of electroconvulsive therapy.",

Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time.

      "abstract": "The neurologic dysfunction underlying epilepsy can predispose patients to psychiatric disorders, and the incidence of both depression and psychosis is increased in people with epilepsy. Depressive disorders are the most frequently recognized psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, but depression in children can be particularly difficult to recognize. Clinicians need to inquire about not only classic symptoms of depression such as anhedonia but also less obvious symptoms such as unprovoked irritability, unsubstantiated complaints of lack of love from family members, somatic complaints, and problems with concentration and poor school performance. The diagnosis of depressive disorders in children with epilepsy and mental retardation is even more difficult. Physicians need to be alert for the presence of iatrogenic depression, which may result from antiepileptic drugs or epilepsy surgery. People with epilepsy are also at increased risk for psychosis, which can be interictal, postictal, or (rarely) an expression of ictal activity. This psychosis can be related to seizure remission (ie, alternative psychosis) or iatrogenic (eg, related to antiepileptic drugs or following temporal lobectomy). Although both antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs have the potential to lower the seizure threshold and increase seizures, careful drug selection, dosing, and slow titration can minimize this risk, allowing treatment to proceed.

Depuis la découverte des effets antidépresseurs de la kétamine, il existe un regain d’intérêt pour cette classe de molécules. En effet, la psilocybine et l’acide lysergique diéthylamide (LSD) gagnent de la popularité en tant que traitement pour la dépression et l’addiction, la 3,4-méthylènedioxyméthamphétamine (MDMA) pour l’état de stress post-traumatique, et l’ibogaïne pour l’addiction. Malgré des profils pharmacologiques distincts, ces différentes drogues partagent une cinétique d’action similaire : leurs effets thérapeutiques se font ressentir dans les heures suivant l’administration et perdurent au-delà de leur élimination par l’organisme. Ceci suggère des mécanismes plastiques et neurogéniques impliquant entre autres des facteurs trophiques.

      "abstract": "Abstract When pain is moderate and can’t be controlled by the non-opioid (nonnarcotic) drugs, the next step is to use a weak opioid, of which codeine is the most well known. Like the strong opioids, these drugs typically cause constipation, which can be prevented with laxatives (such as senna [Senokot-S], Metamucil, Milk of Magnesia, Dulcolax, or suppositories), stool softeners (such as Colace), or enemas as needed (see Chapter 10). Nausea and vomiting are also sometimes a side effect, although these side effects usually last only a few days with consistent use of these medications. Although physical dependence (which means withdrawal symptoms would occur if the drug were stopped suddenly) and tolerance (which means that, as the body adapts to the dose, more is needed to achieve the same painrelieving effect) sometimes occur, they are usually not important problems when the weak opioids are used for pain. These drugs are not really ‘‘weak’‘; they are just considered weaker than the ‘‘strong’‘opioids (such as morphine) because their dosage is limited by the other compounds with which they are formulated, such as Tylenol or aspirin. Because the dosing guidelines and side effects are so different for the so-called ‘‘strong’‘opioids, a fuller discussion of their use will be explored in the next chapter.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

      "title": "Therapeutic recommendations for management of severe hyponatremia: current concepts on pathogenesis and prevention of neurologic complications.",
      "abstract": "Patients with hyponatremia are exposed to major neurological complications. On the one hand hyponatremia itself produces brain edema, increased intracranial pressure which potentially leads to subsequent neuropathological sequelae or death. On the other hand excessive correction could be followed by development of brain demyelinating lesions (central pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis) with major disability or fatal outcome. Understanding of brain adaptative mechanisms to changes in osmolality largely contributes to explain these neurological events. When serum sodium decreases, the brain prevents swelling by extruding electrolytes and organic osmolytes, a process almost fully achieved after 48 h. Conversely, during subsequent increase in serum sodium, reestablishment of intracerebral osmolytes occurs but their reuptake is more delayed (+/- 5 days). In both circumstances, these mechanisms can be overwhelmed, leading to brain damage. Acute hyponatremia (< 48 h) is generally hospital-acquired, mainly in the postoperative state and/or after excessive fluid administration. After abrupt fall in serum sodium, seizure, respiratory arrest and coma may develop and these manifestations are sometimes explosive in nature. Recognition of even minor symptoms is crucial and implies prompt correction. There is generally no risk of brain myelinolysis in acute hyponatremia. Some factors are suspected to aggravate the prognosis of hyponatremic encephalopathy, including female gender (menstruant women), hypoxia and young age. Chronic hyponatremia (> 48 h) usually develops outside the hospital and is generally better tolerated. The risks of brain myelinolysis can be largely reduced by limiting the correction level to < or = 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, if necessary, the initial rate of correction can be rapid provided that the final correction remains < 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, when other recognized risk factors for myelinolysis (hypokalemia, liver disease, poor nutritional state, burns) are present, correction should not exceed 10 mEq/1/24 h. Demyelinization is also observed in hypernatremia but it follows greater (50%) increase in serum sodium than from hyponatremic baseline. For symptomatic hyponatremia, rapid correction is usually obtained by hypertonic saline (3%) infusion. Another option consists in administration of intravenous or oral urea. Urea allows a rapid reduction of brain edema and intracranial pressure which is followed by subsequent correction of hyponatremia. Experimental data also suggest that treatment of hyponatremia with urea is associated with a lower incidence of myelinolysis. In hyponatremic patients without symptoms, there is no need for rapid correction and the treatment should be more conservative. Close monitoring of the serum sodium is indicated initially and if necessary, correction must be stopped and diuresis interrupted with dDAVP. Given recent experimental data, in patients overly corrected (delta SNa > 15 mEq/1/24 h), the risk of myelinolysis could be greatly reduced by rapidly decreasing the serum sodium through hypotonic fluids administration and dDAVP.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Cardiovascular agents can be associated with a negative effect on cognition, especially in older adults, critically ill people, and those with baseline cognitive impairment. Negative effect on cognition is commonly reported as uncomplicated acute confusion and delirium and, less commonly, chronic cognitive changes due to drug-induced depression and/or dementia. Methods: A literature review of case reports, case series, prospective cohort studies, clinical trials, and literature reviews were included in this study. Articles were located using online databases PubMed and Medline using the following keywords: antiarrhythmic agents, anticholinergic burden, antihypertensive agents, beta-blockers, cardiovascular agents, cognitive impairment, delirium, cognition, dementia, depression, digoxin, diuretics, and drug-induced cognitive impairment. Results: In general, use of all antihypertensives, especially in the case of polypharmacy or inappropriate dosing, can lead to hypotension and/or bradycardia, and thus lead to mental/cognitive status change due to decreased cerebral perfusion. Use of diuretics can be associated with fluid/electrolyte and/or acid-base imbalance, resulting in the onset of confusion and delirium. In addition, cardiovascular agents with central bioavailability, such digoxin and select antiarrhythmics, and antihypertensives may carry a risk for cognitive impairment due to various mechanisms proposed, such as antagonism of central muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, neurotransmission imbalance in the brain, and disruption of physiologic function of sodium/potassium ATPase in the neuronal cells. Discussion: When dealing with an individual who presents with acute, subacute, and chronic changes in cognitive function, one should perform a thorough medication history as the first step in order to aid in the identification of drug-induced cognitive impairment.",

Ces patients souffraient de demence de type Alzheimer, a corps de Lewy, mixte ou non specifiee et presentaient des troubles de comportement moderes a graves. Les chercheurs ont tente d’exclure les patients presentant une depression associee a leur demence. Ainsi, les patients ayant presente un episode depressif majeur dans les six derniers mois ou des symptomes depressifs cliniques lors du recrutement en etaient exclus. Ont egalement ete exclus les patients presentant un diagnostic de schizophrenie, de desordre schizo-affectif, psychotique ou bipolaire, un retard mental, un deficit cognitif secondaire a un traumatisme crânien ou un delirium induit par une substance, l’abus d’alcool ou de drogues, une dependance ou la maladie de Parkinson. D’autre part, une maladie physique instable, une creatinine = 177 umol/l, une enzyme hepatique (AST) ou une bilirubine superieure a deux fois les limites normales, des causes de demence potentiellement reversibles, un traitement avec un neuroleptique depot dans les deux mois precedant le recrutement ou avec de la fluoxetine dans les quatre semaines precedant le recrutement menaient aussi a l’exclusion. Cet echantillon de 103 patients devait suffire a detecter une difference de 15 % entre les deux traitements, avec une puissance de 80 % et un alpha de 0,05. Interventions : L’etude a dure douze semaines. Les patients etaient randomises dans deux groupes et recevaient soit de la risperidone (n = 50), soit du citalopram (n = 53). La dose initiale quotidienne de risperidone etait de 0,5 mg et elle etait titree a 1 mg apres trois jours. Au besoin, elle pouvait etre augmentee de 0,5 mg chaque deux semaines jusqu'a la dose quotidienne maximale de 2 mg. La dose initiale quotidienne de citalopram etait de 10 mg et elle etait titree a 20 mg apres trois jours. Au besoin, elle pouvait etre augmentee de 10 mg chaque deux semaines jusqu'a la dose quotidienne maximale de 40 mg. Les patients etaient examines au recrutement, au moment de la repartition aleatoire, apres trois jours, sept jours, chaque semaine pendant cinq semaines et toutes les deux semaines par la suite. Les interventions etaient evaluees au moyen d’echelles analogues validees (NBRS : Neurobehavioral Rating Scale et UKU : Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser). Les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase, la memantine et le lorazepam etaient les seuls traitements concomitants permis pendant l’etude.

      "title": "Experience with Drugs and Driving in Queensland, Australia",
      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms.

      "abstract": "Making the differential diagnosis of a psychosis associated with psychedelic drugs is a difficult and confusing, but very important, clinical problem. Understanding the interaction between the drug effect, the current stress on the individual, and his characteristic level of ego function not only makes differential diagnosis possible, but has ramifications for treatment and prognosis. This interaction can best be understood by clarifying a number of different factors including the extent of drug use, past personal history, prepsychotic level of functioning, mode of onset of the psychosis, nature of external precipitating factors, and presenting mental status. Three different clinical entities can be found when this is done, each of which presented a psychotic appearance, and in each of which past drug use was involved. These are: 1) An acute response to a drug effect, in which the weakened ego of a borderline individual is overwhelmed and not able to reintegrate when the drug effect wanes. This individual responds well to short term hospitalization with supportive treatment. 2) A gradual shift toward projection, denial and then delusions, and withdrawal even in relatively healthy individuals who take drugs very frequently at a time of a life crisis. The development of alloplastic ego defenses is to avoid a dealing with painful affect, and hospitalization or any treatment which would require confronting this was unsuccessful and just reinforces the new defense structure. 3) Occasional drug use in a schizophrenic may well have no effect on that individual's overall clinical course or response to any mode of treatment. Why the drug experience, a transient stress of ego function, does not have long range consequences is not known, but may be because the ego has learned to adapt to these transient episodes, which are much less threatening than actual events in the individual's life. Three patients were presented who demonstrated these three clinical conditions and their different responses to treatment were noted.",

      "title": "The Role of NMDA Receptors in Opiate Tolerance, Sensitization, and Physical Dependence",
      "abstract": "When administered acutely, opiates such as morphine produce characteristic behavioral effects, including a decrease in pain responsiveness (analgesia) and an increase in pleasure (euphoria). Because of their profound ability to produce analgesia, opiates are the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe or chronic pain. Because of their ability to produce positive reinforcement and pleasure, these drugs are widely self-administered and, therefore, represent an important class of abused drugs. Long-term treatment with opiates, as well as other drugs of abuse, leads to three well-known consequences: tolerance, which is a decrease in an effect of a drug with chronic use; sensitization, which is an increase in an effect of drug with chronic use; and physical dependence, which is a physiological change produced by chronic use, such that the absence of the drug results in an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome* (1–3). Tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence are important in both the clinical use of opiates and in their self-administration. For example, the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of opiates may lead to the need to escalate the dose during the treatment of chronic pain, whereas tolerance to the euphorigenic effect may be a factor in the escalation of drug use in addicts (4). Conversely, tolerance to dose-limiting side effects may allow addicts to escalate drug intake and achieve greater euphorigenic effects. The development of sensitization is thought to be involved in the craving that occurs following chronic use of drugs of abuse and, therefore, critical to addiction (5,6). Finally, the avoidance of withdrawal in physically dependent individuals is considered to be an important factor in maintaining self-administration (2,4).",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The most relevant risk factors for the development of chronic constipation are neurologic disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, immobility, and some drugs, in particular opioids. A proctologic exam and exclusion of red flags form part of the basic assessment. The currently available laxatives are effective and safe, habituation and tolerance (tachyphylaxis) being an exception. Also long-term intake of laxatives is of no concern when taken in recommended doses (no relevant hypokalemia!). Though the newer compounds (e. g., prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone) are not more effective than the older ones, developing new drugs with alternative mode of action is reasonable since there are patients not satisfied with the currently available substances. Macrogol, Bisacodyl, and sodium picosulfate are the laxatives of first choice. Their selection depends on the individual preference of the patient. Opioids often induce constipation which can be ameliorated by laxatives or PAMORAs (peripherally acting µ-opioid antagonists).",

The disease is often manifested as perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Positive symptoms refer to abnormal or hyperactive mental functions, including abnormal sensations (visual and auditory hallucinations), delusions, confused thoughts, disorganized speech and behavior, etc. Negative symptoms refer to reduced or absent mental functions, including lack of motivation, lack of pleasure, social withdrawal, reduced willpower, etc. Cognitive deficits include impaired attention, decline in executive function and working memory, etc. Although the use of chlorpromazine in 1950 cured or alleviated the psychiatric symptoms of most SCZ patients, there were still 20% of the patients who were drug-resistant or dissatisfied with psychotropic treatments. So far, SCZ treatment mainly includes medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychotherapy, and rTMS treatment.",

In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

Symptoms commonly include hallucinations, mostly of the auditory type, and affective disturbances, in a background of clear consciousness. In this case series, four subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption were evaluated for hallucinatory symptoms after chronic alcohol intake. All of them had auditory hallucinations, with an anxious affect and no cognitive deficits. Only one case had visual hallucinations. The psychotic symptoms in all the patients were completely remitted with antipsychotics. Resumption of alcohol consumption increases the risk of relapse. The pathophysiology of alcoholic hallucinosis is not yet established and needs to be studied further for better diagnosis and management.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

There are data that prove the fact that patients with bipolar disorder show cognitive deficits in all stages of the disorder, but also during remission phases. Within bipolar disorder, bipolar depression occurs more frequently, lasts longer and has a higher rate of relapses than mania. Bipolar patients usually complain of cognitive deficits such as attentional or memory deficits Patients with bipolar disorder experiment during depressive episodes dysfunctions in attention (difficulties in focusing and maintaining attention), memory (deficits of declarative and nondeclarative memory, affected verbal recall and recognition), language (bradyphemia with longer moments of pause during speech), psychomotor performance (psychomotor inhibition, slowness of motor functions when the number of tasks increases), executive functions (limited ability to acquire or relearn different skills), general intellectual functioning (information processing deficits). Recent studies have made some suggestion regarding a certain degree of cognitive impairment that is also found in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. In order to have a more accurate assessment regarding the degree of cognitive dysfunctions both during depressive episodes and euthymic phases in bipolar disorder, diagnosis criteria for depression and for remission should be strictly respected and coexisting factors that may influence the results should not be taken in consideration.",

It was already known at the time of Hippocrates, and it was well described by Johanne Baptista Margagni, teacher at the Padua Medical School, in the 18th century. Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in the pres­ ence of hepatic functional impairment secondary to acute liver failure or chronic parenchymal liver disease with or without spontaneous or surgi­ cally induced portalsystemic shunting of portal blood. The neuropsychiatric symptoms of liver failure are varied and range from subtle alterations, including mild personality change and disturbance in sleep rhythm, to confusion, drowsiness, stupor, and finally deep coma. In acute liver failure the progression of events may be extremely rapid, taking place in only a few hours. In chronic encephalopathy, in contrast, consciousness may be slowly altered over months, and may occasionally present as progressive and irre­ versible neurological symptomatology with dementia, parkinsonism, or other extrapyramidal signs suggesting involvement of the cerebellum or basal ganglia (170). Most often in the chronic situation, however, episodes of mental impairment are episodic, the result of defined stresses, and recov­ ery to the premorbid state is the rule. Other symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are not specific for liver disease. Asterixis (flapping tremor of the extremities) is probably the most characteristic neurological sign of hepatic encephalopathy, is more common",

Not all alcohol abusers show alcoholic brain damage, since environmental and genetic influences, as well as an individual's acquired and inherent modifying factors, play important roles. This chapter is directed at the alcoholic brain damage induced by high alcohol intake over a long period of time <5-10 years. Chronic alcohol abusers during alcohol intoxication exhibit a variety of acute adverse effects which include ataxia of gait, slurred speech, prolonged reaction times, poor memory consolidation, impaired emotional modulation and compromised judgement. Overall this induces impaired judgement, blunted affect, poor insight, social withdrawal, reduced motivation, distractibility, and attention and impulse-control deficits. Ethanol has a modulating effect on immunity, inducing neuroinflammation, particularly when other stimulating molecules are present, which may be an important factor in the aetiology of alcoholic brain damage.",

Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

Les sujets predisposes peuvent declencher des troubles psychopathologiques nevrotiques (hysteriques, phobiques ou obsessionnels) ou des desordres psychotiques (trouble reactionnel post-traumatique, trouble psychotique bref, bouffees delirante ou autres affections psychotiques vraies). – Ces reactions disparaissent souvent au bout de quelques jours ou de quelques semaines. Cependant, certaines jeunes victimes voient leurs troubles persister et d’autres commencent a souffrir de symptomes prefigurant un syndrome psychotraumatique. D’autres encore vont inaugurer ou confirmer une psychopathologie nevrotique ou psychotique. – Generalement, chez les jeunes victimes, le syndrome post-traumatique apparait rapidement apres l’evenement critique. Il s’observe frequemment des l’âge de 3 ans. Il se caracterise par la reviviscence de l’evenement adverse sous forme de symptomes intrusifs (flash-back, souvenirs repetitifs, cauchemars, impression que l’evenement pourrait se renouveler, phenomenes moteurs elementaires, conduite de repetition et jeux repetitifs, detresse et reactivite physiologique a l’exposition d’indices rappelant l’evenement), par l’emoussement de la reactivite generale (desinteret pour l’entourage et les activites) et l’evitement des stimuli qui lui sont associes (lieux, personnes, conversations, pensees et sentiments) ainsi que par une hyper activation neurovegetative. – Les nourrissons, les enfants et les adolescents manifestent frequemment des troubles non specifiques aux syndromes post-traumatiques tels les troubles anxieux (crises d’angoisse, agitation, surveillance inquiete de l’environnement, attachement anxieux, exacerbation des peurs infantiles), des symptomes depressifs (desarroi, tristesse, sentiment de solitude, inhibition motrice et intellectuelle, repli sur soi, sentiments de culpabilite excessifs et inappropries), des desordres psychosomatiques (symptomes neurovegetatifs, asthenie, douleurs psychogenes, regain d’une maladie psychosomatique preexistante), des perturbations du comportement (auto – et hetero-agressivite, conduites a risque, instabilite motrice, troubles du sommeil, desordres alimentaires, dependances) ainsi que des comportements regressifs et des difficultes d’apprentissage. – Le DSM-IV repertorie l’Etat de Stress Aigu englobant tant les reactions de survenue immediate durant au moins deux jours que les reponses post-immediates perdurant jusqu’a quatre semaines apres l’incident. La CIM-10 decrit la reaction aigue a un facteur de stress apparaissant dans les minutes suivant l’incident critique et disparaissant en quelques heures, tout a plus en quelques jours.",

      "abstract": "espanolLa sedacion paliativa se define como la disminucion deliberada del nivel de conciencia del enfermo mediante la administracion de los farmacos apropiados con el objeto de evitar un sufrimiento intenso causado por uno o mas sintomas refractarios; la sedacion en la agonia se asume como continua y tan profunda como sea necesario. La experiencia clinica muestra situaciones concretas donde es probable que exista una cierta confusion de terminos. Asi, se pueden entender de manera erronea como sedacion paliativa los casos de tratamiento sintomatico del delirium hiperactivo en la etapa de ultimos dias (una situacion que se presenta a menudo como la primera causa de sedacion en agonia) o aquellos en que se lleva a cabo un aumento progresivo de la medicacion paliativa, que con frecuencia puede tener un efecto sedante, paralelo a la mayor intensidad de los sintomas en enfermos con un deterioro severo debido a la progresion de la enfermedad. En ambos casos se emplean farmacos con efecto sedante para aliviar las complicaciones clinicas y el sufrimiento en un enfermo que tiene la muerte cercana pero las circunstancias del enfermo, el objetivo de estos tratamientos y el modo en que se emplean no coinciden con la definicion de sedacion paliativa. EnglishPalliative sedation in defined as the deliberate reduction in the level of consciousness of the patient by administering the appropriate drugs in order to avoid intense suffering caused by one or more refractory symptoms; sedation in the patient who is in his last days or hours of life is assumed to be continuous and as deep as needed. Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

The results of recent studies shown in this review proved effectiveness of pharmacotherapy with pyritinol in children with perinatal injury of central nervous system and its consequences, psychomotor and speech development delay, dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, cognitive disorders and learning disabilities (including manifestations of epilepsy, chronic tic disorders and Tourette syndrome). Due to its ability to optimize metabolic processes in central nervous system, pyritinol is used in treatment of vegetative dysfunction in children and adolescents, especially associated with asthenical manifestations, as well as in complex therapy of exertion headache and migraine. The drug is effective in treatment of cognitive disorders in children and adolescents with epilepsy, pyritinol was administered without changing of the basic anticonvulsive therapy and no deterioration (increase of severity of seizures or intensity of epileptiform activity on electroencephalogramms) was observed. Significant nootropic effect of pyritinol, including neurometabolic, neuroprotective, neurodynamic and other mechanisms, in association with safety and rare side effects of this drug determines its wide usage in pediatric neurology.",

      "title": "Opioid Crisis—An Emphasis on Fentanyl Analogs",
      "abstract": "Opioids are the mainstay for the management of moderate to severe pain. However, their acute use is associated with several side effects, ranging from nausea, itching, sedation, hypotension to respiratory depression, and death. Also, chronic use of these drugs can lead to the development of tolerance, dependence, and eventually addiction. The most serious side effect, lethality due to opioid-induced overdose, has reached the level of national emergency, i.e., the opioid crisis, which is now the forefront of medicine. In a detailed review (Novel Synthetic Opioids: The Pathologist's Point of View), Frisoni and colleagues have discussed the side effects of novel licit and illicit fentanyl derivatives, as well as the related compounds which are more potent and faster acting than morphine and other conventional opioids (Frisoni, et al., 2018). These drugs affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can promote the development of addiction due to the quick rush they induce because of their faster entry into the brain. These drugs also arrest the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, increasing the chance of respiratory arrest, leading to opioid-induced overdose morbidity and mortality. The respiratory arrest induced by opioids can be potentiated by other CNS depressants, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, and therefore may occur more frequently in polydrug users. Therefore, the use of these newer fentanyl derivatives as well as other fast acting opioids should be avoided or limited to specific cases and must be kept out of the reach of children and adolescents who are more vulnerable to become addicted or overdose themselves.",

      "title": "Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy: Pathogenetic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications",
      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

      "abstract": "While opioid dependence has more treatment agents available than other abused drugs, none are curative. They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses. The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine. alpha-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

      "title": "Chronic Psychosis in Dual Disorder Heroin Use Disorder Patients",
      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder, manic or depressive episodes and mixed states are frequently marked by psychotic symptoms. Moreover, psychosis may occur after substance use disorder, often intervening with the effect of making the clinical picture indistinguishable from that of a primary psychosis. Cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, alcohol and poly-use most commonly develop psychosis induced by the non-medical use of substances. Among substance use disorder users, it has not yet been ascertained whether opioids exert a psychotic effect. Still, some authors have supported the view that opioids have antidepressant, antipanic and antipsychotic effects. It has also been hypothesized that affective disorders, coupled with genetic disposition rather than affective disturbance or psychosis, result in bipolar psychosis or schizoaffective disorder, respectively. In the history of chronic psychotics, heroin use is relatively infrequent. Chronic use of psychotogenic substances and autonomous chronicity of psychotic symptoms may root in a bipolar substrate. Substance use among people with schizophrenia cannot always be justified in terms of dysphoria. Still, the number of depressive symptoms can significantly influence the risk rate for alcohol, cannabinoid use or poly-use. Dual disorder psychotic heroin-addicted patients usually enter treatment with more severe psychopathological aspects and a shorter, less severe addiction history than their non-psychotic peers suggesting that these patients are likely to benefit from opioid medication. These data indirectly confirm the antipsychotic effects of opioids and Khantzian's self-medication hypothesis. For further confirmation, patients affected by chronic psychosis and anxiety disorders tend to progress from a psychiatric disorder to a substance use disorder. In contrast, patients with mood disorders are initially affected by drug addiction. As far as dual disorder is concerned, it is advisable to employ agents that do not heavily affect dopamine metabolism in an inhibitory way since the worsening of use hampers the effectiveness upon psychotic symptoms. On the other hand, when the tie with substances is more robust, their use may amplify as a direct consequence of dopamine antagonism, as a compensatory mechanism effective throughout the reward pathway. Novel antipsychotics seem to permit equivalent effectiveness on psychotic symptoms without promoting drug use, at least to the same extent, and might have anticraving properties.",

      "title": "The Role of NMDA Receptors in Opiate Tolerance, Sensitization, and Physical Dependence A Review of the Research, A Cellular Model, and Implications for the Treatment of Pain and Addiction",
      "abstract": "When administered acutely, opiates such as morphine produce characteristic behavioral effects, including a decrease in pain responsiveness (analgesia) and an increase in pleasure (euphoria). Because of their profound ability to produce analgesia, opiates are the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe or chronic pain. Because of their ability to produce positive reinforcement and pleasure, these drugs are widely self-administered and, therefore, represent an important class of abused drugs. Long-term treatment with opiates, as well as other drugs of abuse, leads to three well-known consequences: tolerance, which is a decrease in an effect of a drug with chronic use; sensitization, which is an increase in an effect of drug with chronic use; and physical dependence, which is a physiological change produced by chronic use, such that the absence of the drug results in an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome* (1–3). Tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence are important in both the clinical use of opiates and in their self-administration. For example, the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of opiates may lead to the need to escalate the dose during the treatment of chronic pain, whereas tolerance to the euphorigenic effect may be a factor in the escalation of drug use in addicts (4). Conversely, tolerance to dose-limiting side effects may allow addicts to escalate drug intake and achieve greater euphorigenic effects. The development of sensitization is thought to be involved in the craving that occurs following chronic use of drugs of abuse and, therefore, critical to addiction (5,6). Finally, the avoidance of withdrawal in physically dependent individuals is considered to be an important factor in maintaining self-administration (2,4). Although tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence have been widely studied, there is still an incomplete understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in their development and expression. Recent experiments suggest that excitatory amino acid systems and, in particular, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may have an important role in these phenomena. This review will explore the role of NMDA receptors in the behavioral changes that occur following long-term opiate administration, including tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence.

Common opioid adverse effects include constipation, sedation, and nausea. A lesser-known sequelae is opioid induced androgen deficiency (OPIAD). The objective of this review was to better characterize the effects of opioids on the endocrine system. Published data were evaluated to identify links between opioid use and hypogonadism, as well as to describe proposed physiological mechanisms. Chronic opioid use may predispose to hypogonadism through alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis. The resulting hypogonadism and hypotestosteronism may contribute to impaired sexual function, decreased libido, infertility, and osteoporosis- none of which may be clinically recognized as opioid related. OPIAD is a recognized consequence of long-term opioid therapy. Patients initiated or maintained on opioids should be queried about symptoms that might suggest hypogonadism including irregular menses, reduced libido, depression, fatigue, and hot flashes or night sweats. Some clinicians recommend assessment of baseline testosterone levels prior to initiating therapy. Additional data appear necessary to formulate guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of OPIAD. Options include, rotating, reducing the dose or type, or cessation of opioid therapy or adding hormonal supplementation in the form of androgen replacement therapy. There are multiple formulations of testosterone available for replacement therapy, which is usually guided by laboratory measurements.",

      "abstract": "Delirium (acute confusional states), a common and often overlooked psychiatric disorder, can occur at any age, but elderly persons are especially prone to develop it. In later life, it is often a conspicuous feature of systemic or cerebral disease and drug (notably anticholinergic) toxicity, and it may constitute a grave prognostic sign. Its development in a hospitalized patient may interfere with his or her management, disrupt ward routine, and cause medicolegal complications as a result of patient injury. Acute onset of a fluctuating level of awareness, accompanied by sleep-wake cycle disruption, lethargy or agitation, and nocturnal worsening of symptoms, are diagnostic. Early recognition of delirium and treatment of its underlying cause are essential. (<i>JAMA</i>1987;258:1789-1792)",

      "title": "Bouncing back: Brain rehabilitation amid opioid and stimulant epidemics",
      "abstract": "Recent methamphetamine and opioid use epidemics are a major public health concern. Chronic stimulant and opioid use are characterized by significant psychosocial, physical and mental health costs, repeated relapse, and heightened risk of early death. Neuroimaging research highlights deficits in brain processes and circuitry that are linked to responsivity to drug cues over natural rewards as well as suboptimal goal-directed decision-making. Despite the need for interventions, little is known about (1) how the brain changes with prolonged abstinence or as a function of various treatments; and (2) how symptoms change as a result of neuromodulation. This review focuses on the question: What do we know about changes in brain function during recovery from opioids and stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine? We provide a detailed overview and critique of published research employing a wide array of neuroimaging methods – functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, event-related potentials, diffusion tensor imaging, and multiple brain stimulation technologies along with neurofeedback – to track or induce changes in drug craving, abstinence, and treatment success in stimulant and opioid users. Despite the surge of methamphetamine and opioid use in recent years, most of the research on neuroimaging techniques for recovery focuses on cocaine use. This review highlights two main findings: (1) interventions can lead to improvements in brain function, particularly in frontal regions implicated in goal-directed behavior and cognitive control, paired with reduced drug urges/craving; and (2) the targeting of striatal mechanisms implicated in drug reward may not be as cost-effective as prefrontal mechanisms, given that deep brain stimulation methods require surgery and months of intervention to produce effects. Overall, more studies are needed to replicate and confirm findings, particularly for individuals with opioid and methamphetamine use disorders.",

An individual may suffer an accident such as a car crash or near-drowning while under the influence (consequences related to use in dangerous situations). An individual may acknowledge the need for treatment after losing his/her job, home, car, friends, and family (job and personal role and social consequences).

      "abstract": "Background: The Stroop effect is a simple phenomenon that reveals a lot about the brain processes information. The Stroop effect is our tendency to experience difficulty naming a physical color when it is used to spell the name of a different color. It is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. The childhood disorder is an any illness, impairment, or abnormal condition that affects primarily infants and children. Some of the childhood disorders like Mild Mental Retardation, Learning Disorders, Motor Skills Disorders, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders, Eating disorders of infancy or early childhood, Tic disorders. Visual perceptual discrimination is the brainÂ’s ability to accurately perceive information in a complex, fluid and confusing situation and, even more importantly, to accurately differentiate amongst confusable types of information and ability to identify detail seeing Items like differences in shape, color and orientation. Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to assess the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders. To evaluate the level of visual perceptual discrimination before and after administration of Stroop task performance among various childhood disorders. To associate the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. Materials and Methods: The research approach used in the study was Quantitative in nature. Pre Â–Experimental One group Pre- test Post test design was used. Purposive Sampling technique was used to select the samples. A total of 30 ChildrenÂ’s with various childhood disorders were selected for this study. Visual Perceptual Discrimination checklist was used to assess the Visual Perceptual Discrimination Problems among children with childhood disorder and administering stroop task performance using Flashcard was used for intervention and Post test was conducted by using same tool in same manner. Results and Conclusion: The result showed that majority of the childhood disorders at selected home 26(86.7%) had low and 4(13.3%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination during Pre test. The Calculated pairedÂ‘tÂ’ value was t= -8.55 and was found to be statistically significant at -P=&lt;0.001 level. After Intervention majority of childhood disorders at selected home 16(53.3%) had low and 14(46.7%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination. There was area of residence and type of childhood disorders had shown statistically significant association between post testlevel of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. The other demographic variable had not shown statistically significant association between the post-test level of visual Perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables .The researcher concluded that by administering Stroop task performance shows that the intervention helps in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination in good range and found to be one of the helpful interventions in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination among children with various childhood disorders. The study had proved that Effectiveness and excellent changes in improvement of visual perceptual discrimination among Children\\s with various childhood disorders.",

The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history.

However, it has not been found a unique profile of impairment associated with cocaine addiction.To review the studies about neurocognitive performance in cocaine addicted patients, with special attention to the research method used.A great diversity in the research methodology of cognitive deficits associated with cocaine addiction has been used. These differences make difficult to compare results and obtain a clear profile of neuropsychological deficits. Even though, most of studies find neuropsychological deficits (mainly of medium size) associated with cocaine addiction. These problems are usually related to attention, verbal and visual memory and executive functions (working memory, mental flexibility, verbal fluency, inhibition and decision making). Moreover, in some studies a dissociated profile of cognitive performance has been found.Chronic use of cocaine is associated with worse cognitive performance. Therefore, the cognitive assessment of cocaine addicted patients can improve the understanding of the nature of the difficulties that these patients exhibit in everyday life and also can help to guide the treatment. Probably, the presence of subtle cognitive changes has important consequences on the behaviour of these patients. However, neuropsychological performance is not usually assessed in the assessment guidelines of this disorder. Therefore, it is proposed to include a neuropsychological assessment for initial assessment of cocaine addicted patients, as well as to tailor treatment to the found deficit.",

      "abstract": "Nos dias atuais, o menor indicador de sofrimento psíquico tende a ser caracterizado como patológico, sendo imediatamente administrado um psicofármaco. Nesse sentido, emerge-se o conceito de “ overtreatment ”, que é o ato de medicar em excesso ou então não plenamente condizente com o quadro clínico do paciente, sendo a elevação da prescrição de psicofármacos na última década uma de suas principais manifestações. Portanto, se o uso excessivo de medicamentos já se configura como um panorama preocupante em adultos, a conjuntura torna-se ainda mais grave tratando-se de crianças, haja vista toda a imaturidade neuropsicomorfofuncional. Haja vista toda a polêmica e controvérsia que permeiam a sua abordagem terapêutica, é nesse cenário em que se enquadra o Transtorno de Déficit de Atenção e Hiperatividade (TDAH), transtorno do neurodesenvolvimento definido por níveis prejudiciais de desatenção, desorganização e/ou hiperatividade-impulsividade. Diante do exposto, o desenvolvimento desta pesquisa foi motivado pela necessidade de conhecer os reais impactos do uso de metilfenidato, de modo a compreender terapêuticas alternativas multidisciplinares utilizadas no tratamento do TDAH. O trabalho teve como objetivo a avaliação dos benefícios e malefícios no tratamento medicamentoso com Metilfenidato, além da qualificação dos impactos do uso do Metilfenidato na vida dos pacientes diagnosticados com TDAH e atendidos no Conjunto Hospitalar de Sorocaba (CHS) Como metodologia, realizou-se um estudo longitudinal de modo a acompanhar crianças entre seis e doze anos, durante o seu tratamento para o TDAH por um período de um ano no ambulatório de neuropediatria do CHS. Foram aplicados bimensalmente os questionários “The Behavior Problems Inventory” e “SNAP IV” aos pacientes no intuito de avaliar a evolução de seus respectivos transtornos. Assim sendo, observou-se um total de 17 pacientes, dos quais 11 faziam uso de Metilfenidato (grupo A) e 6 não utilizavam tal medicamento (grupo B). De todas as crianças analisadas, 76,5 % faziam acompanhamento regular com psicoterapia (72,7 % do grupo A e 83,3 % do grupo B) e 64,7 % praticavam regularmente atividades físicas (81,8 % do grupo A e 33,3 % do grupo B). Ademais, foi constatada acentuada melhora dos sintomas (diminuição da frequência e severidade de comportamentos agressivos, estereotipados, hiperativos e desatentos) do TDAH no grupo A, em comparação ao grupo B (sintomas se mantiveram em 100% dos indivíduos observados). Dessa forma, foi consensual, tanto pelos relatórios escolares, quanto pela impressão pessoal dos pacientes e familiares, que a utilização do Metilfenidato acarretou maiores benefícios do que malefícios sobre a qualidade de vida diária de cada criança e, especialmente, no rendimento escolar. É válido ressaltar a importância de uma abordagem multidisciplinar em relação ao diagnóstico e seguimento do paciente com TDAH.",

Characteristics of OIH are worsening pain over time despite an increased dose of the opioid. It is often recognized neither by the physician nor the patient, and it results in increasing doses of opioid medications and continued unsatisfying pain levels experienced by the patient. The increased use of narcotics has a negative impact on patient outcome, as patients suffer from increased pain levels and often develop depression. Patients with OIH require frequent assessment for aberrant behaviors as an indicator of addictive use. Opioid-seeking behavior may complicate the clinical picture of failed opioid therapy. The treatment of OIH is to discontinue the opioid medication and to treat the patient’s withdrawal symptoms, if necessary, in an inpatient setting with medical monitoring.

      "abstract": "Titulo de la Tesis Doctoral: Differential modulation by sigma-1 receptors of µ- opioid-induced antinociception and side effects: Role of peripheral sigma-1 receptors\nDoctorando: Cristina Sanchez Fernandez\nIntroduccion\nLos agonistas opioides se usan en clinica como analgesicos, principalmente aquellos del subtipo µ, tales como fentanilo, oxicodona, morfina, buprenorfina y tramadol. Esta accion analgesica la producen principalmente a nivel central (p.ej. Christie et al., 2000; Khalefa et al., 2012). Ademas de la analgesia, estos farmacos producen otros efectos derivados principalmente de sus acciones a nivel central, incluyendo confusion mental y depresion respiratoria, entre otros efectos adversos de relevancia clinica (revisado en Waldhoer et al., 2004 y Al-Hasani and Bruchas, 2011). Los opioides tambien producen efectos perifericos, ya que disminuyen el transito intestinal principalmente por su efecto inhibitorio de la actividad del plexo mienterico (Holzer et al., 2009; Brock et al., 2012). Este efecto de los opioides se utiliza clinicamente para el tratamiento sintomatico de la diarrea, concretamente mediante el uso de loperamida. Este farmaco es un agonista opioide que actua exclusivamente a nivel periferico (Menendez et al., 2005), y que, por lo tanto, es capaz de inhibir el transito intestinal aunque carece de efectos centrales (Gallelli et al., 2010), por lo que no se utiliza clinicamente como analgesico.\nEl receptor sigma-1 (sigma-1) es una proteina neuromoduladora cuya farmacologia esta bien descrita en la actualidad, habiendo disponibles tanto antagonistas (BD-1063, BD-1047, NE-100 y S1RA) como agonistas (PRE-084 y (+)-pentazocina) selectivos (Cobos et al., 2008; Romero et al., 2012). Se sabe que la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 a nivel central potencia la analgesia opioide (Mei y Pasternak, 2002 y 2007; Marrazzo et al., 2006). Sin embargo, se desconoce si este receptor es capaz de modular la analgesia opioide a nivel periferico o si su inhibicion tambien podria incrementar los efectos no analgesicos de los opioides, lo cual limitaria su utilidad clinica. Desafortunadamente, la inhibicion del transito intestinal tambien es producida por los opioides analgesicos (con penetrabilidad central) y tiene un gran impacto en la calidad de vida del paciente, ya que el estrenimiento producido por estos farmacos es la causa principal de abandono voluntario de medicacion opioide por los pacientes (Dhingra et al., 2013).\n Objetivos\nEl objetivo principal de esta Tesis fue estudiar el papel neuromodulador del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica en el raton, asi como en varios efectos no analgesicos (adversos) de los opioides.\n Resultados\nLos resultados mostraron que la inhibicion genetica del receptor sigma-1 (KO-sigma-1) o farmacologica, administrando por via subcutanea (s.c.) o intraplantar (i.pl.) antagonistas selectivos sigma-1 (BD-1063, BD-1047, NE-100 y S1RA) carecia de efectos antinociceptivos por si mismo. Sin embargo, la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 potencio el efecto analgesico de los agonistas opioides al aplicar un estimulo mecanico doloroso (450 g de presion en la pata trasera). Los ratones KO-sigma-1 tratados s.c. con opioides fentanilo, oxicodona, morfina, buprenorfina, o tramadol, mostraron un marcado aumento del efecto analgesico respecto a los ratones salvajes (WT). La administracion sistemica (s.c) de antagonistas selectivos sigma-1 a ratones WT tratados por via sistemica con dosis bajas de agonistas opioides consiguio una potenciacion similar a la registrada en ratones KO-sigma-1. El efecto de los antagonistas sigma-1 fue totalmente revertido por el agonista selectivo sigma-1 PRE-084, indicando la selectividad de los efectos observados.\nPara estudiar la importancia de los receptores opioides perifericos en el efecto analgesico de los opioides administrados por via sistemica, observado tanto en una situacion normal o de bloqueo del receptor sigma-1, se administro naloxona metiodida, un agonista opioide periferico (Menendez et al., 2005). Los resultados mostraron que la potenciacion del efecto analgesico de los opioides por la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1, era marcadamente mas sensible al antagonista periferico que la analgesia observada en una situacion normal, indicando el papel clave de los opioides perifericos en la potenciacion del efecto analgesico al bloquear el receptor sigma-1.\nAdemas, la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 (en ratones KO-sigma-1 o mediante antagonistas sigma-1 en ratones WT) fue capaza desenmascarar el efecto analgesico de la loperamida, que en circunstancias normales no induce ningun efecto antinociceptivo. Estos datos refuerzan la importancia de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica.\nPosteriormente estudiamos si el bloqueo del receptor sigma-1 a nivel local era suficiente para aumentar el efecto analgesico de ratones tratados sistemicamente con dosis bajas de opioides. La administracion i.pl. de los antagonistas selectivos BD sigma-1 (BD-1063 y S1RA), potencio el efecto analgesico de los opioides solo en la pata adminsitrada, no observandose un aumento en la contralateral, confirmandose asi el efecto a nivel periferico de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1. Esta potenciacion fue revertida por el agonista selectivo sigma-1 PRE-084 asi como por la administracion de naloxona metiodida, lo que indica que el efecto observado depende de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 y de la activacion de los receptores opioides perifericos.\nPor ultimo, evaluamos los efectos de la adminsitracion local (i.pl.) de morfina en ratones WT y KO-sigma-1. En ratones WT no se observo efecto alguno, mientras que en los ratones KO-sigma-1 se observo un claro efecto dosis-dependiente en la pata tratada pero no en la contralateral. Ademas, la coadministracion i.pl. de morfina con BD-1063 indujo un marcado efecto antinociceptivo comparable al de los ratones KO-sigma-1. Cabe destacar que la administracion de diversos antagonistas sigma-1 carecio de efectos en ratones KO-sigma-1, como cabria esperar, ya que su diana farmacologica esta ausente en estos animales (y confirmando la especificidad del efecto de los farmacos). Estos resultados indican que pese a que la morfina en una situacion normal no ejerce efectos analgesicos locales, estos pueden desenmascararse mediante la inhibicion de los receptores sigma-1.\nNuestros resultados obtenidos en ratones KO-sigma-1 no pueden explicarse por posibles cambios adaptativos en los receptores µ en los ratones mutantes, ya que estudios con el radioligando selectivo µ [3H]DAMGO, mostraron que los ratones de ambos genotipos poseen receptores µ farmacologicamente equivalentes (en afinidad y densidad de sitios de fijacion reconocidos por el radioligando) en tejido de cerebro, medula espinal y piel plantar. Ademas, tambien descartamos que hubiera interacciones cruzadas entre los ligandos sigma-1 y los receptores opioides, o los farmacos opioides y los receptores sigma-1, que pudieran interferir en nuestros resultados, ya que los ligandos sigma-1 no desplazaron la union del radioligando µ [3H]DAMGO, y los farmacos opioides no desplazaron la union del radioligando sigma-1 [3H](+)pentazocina.\nLa aparente importancia del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica se vio respaldada por los resultados de expresion del receptor sigma-1 obtenidos mediante la tecnica de Western blot, que desvelaron una expresion del receptor sigma-1 de en torno a diez veces superior a nivel del sistema nervioso periferico (ganglios de la raiz dorsal) que a nivel central (medula espinal y diversos nucleos supraespinales).\nPese a que nuestros datos ilustran la gran importancia del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide, la hiperlocomocion y el estrenimiento inducidos por la administracion de opioides no se vieron alterados en ratones KO-sigma-1 o en WT tratados con antagonistas sigma-1. Conclusion\nConsiderando los resultados aqui resumidos, podemos concluir que la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1, tanto a nivel sistemico como local, incrementa la antinocicepcion opioide a nivel periferico frente a un estimulo mecanico, de lo que se deduce que el receptor sigma-1 es un freno biologico a la analgesia opioide periferica. Esta potenciacion de la analgesia opioide no conlleva un incremento de efectos no analgesicos centrales o perifericos (hiperlocomocion e inhibicion del transito intestinal, respectivamente) derivados de la administracion de opioides. Por lo tanto, el antagonismo sigma-1 podria tener relevancia clinica como adyuvante, a nivel sistemico o local, para incrementar la analgesia opioide sin incrementar los efectos adversos de los opioides.\n Referencias\nAl-Hasani R y Bruchas MR, Anesthesiology. 115:1363-1381 (2011).\nBrock C et al., Drugs. 72:1847-65 (2012).\nChristie MJet al., Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 27:520-523 (2000).\nCobos EJ et al., Curr Neuropharmacol. 6:344-366 (2008).\nDhingra L et al., Palliat Med. 27: 447-56 (2013).\nGallelli L et al., Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 66:37-144 (2010).\nHnasko TS et al., Nature. 438:854-857 (2005).\nHolzer P, Regul Pept. 155:11-7 (2009).\nKhalefa BI et al., Eur J Pain. 16:690-705 (2012).\nMarrazzo A et al., Life Sci. 78:449-53 (2006).\nMei J y Pasternak GW, J.

In addition to doses lower than those used for oral treatment, a more rapid onset of therapeutic effect and a better tolerance, the beneficial effect seems also to depend on the setting in which the treatment takes place. Infusion-therapy is a combined pharmacopsychotherapeutic procedure. Next to infusion-treatment a pretreatment with neuroleptics is advised either via the oral or parenteral route. In extremely refractory depression the infusion-therapy can be applied twice a day; in some cases we resort to continuous infusion for a few days. Infusion-therapy is not applicable in patients prone to epileptic seizures or with serious cerebral dysfunction with a risk of delirium. In case of doubt an EEG is mandatory. Tricyclic antidepressants may not be used in cardiac diseases especially those with troubles of the conduction propagation or repolarization.",

      "title": "Disulfiram-induced seizure in a patient with alcohol dependence syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Disulfiram (DSF) has been used in the management of alcohol dependence as a deterrent agent for over 50 years, and it has been shown to be efficacious when taken under supervision. In addition to the physical symptoms associated with the concomitant use of alcohol, DSF may lead to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) when used alone, which are flushing, throbbing headache, perspiration, etc., DSF has an acceptable risk profile. However, it is associated with many adverse events and drug–drug interactions, including death. The most common less serious adverse effects include headache, sleepiness, tiredness, and halitosis (or metallic taste). Its toxicity may present different clinical aspects, though the mechanism (direct or idiosyncratic) remains unclear. Dermatological, neurological, psychiatric, and cardiac events have been reported. Serious side effects include hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, psychosis, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuritis.[1] There are very few case reports regarding DSF-induced seizures.[23] This shows the need for research, especially in the Indian context, when alcohol consuming population and the wide use of DSF (sometimes surreptitiously) in de-addiction centers are considered. However, because of the ADRs and the dangerous effects of DSF with alcohol, it has to be prescribed with caution and always monitored by medical supervision. Mr. SD, a 40-year-old married male, diagnosed with alcohol dependence for the past 5 years, presented with uncomplicated withdrawal symptoms. Detoxification was done using benzodiazepines in tapering dose, and oral thiamine supplementation was initiated. Investigations including complete blood count, blood sugar, and liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. After he gave written informed consent, DSF was started at a dose of 250 mg at daytime as an aversive agent and increased to 500 mg per day after 1 week. He was also receiving quetiapine 50 mg for sleep disturbances. His birth and developmental history was unremarkable. There was no past or family history of major medical or psychiatric illness. He had been on regular medications under the supervision of a family member and abstinent from alcohol. After 6 weeks, he presented with an episode of generalized tonic–clonic seizure, characterized by sudden-onset, tonic–clonic movements of the extremities with up rolling of the eyeball, frothing from the mouth, and tongue bite. Although there was no incontinence, the whole episode lasted for about 1–2 min. The patient remained confused for few minutes after the event. Subsequently, he was rushed to the hospital and admitted in the neurology ward. There was no history of alcohol intake during this period, or history of other substance abuse. After admission, he was treated with tablet phenytoin 300 mg/day. All routine blood investigations (random blood sugar, serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and complete blood count) were normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy, and electroencephalogram showed generalized spikes. He was discharged after 2 days with tablet quetiapine 50 mg/day, tablet lorazepam 1 mg at night, and tablet phenytoin 300 mg/day. After discharge, he continued to follow-up in the psychiatric outpatient department (OPD). Tablet phenytoin was tapered up after 1 month. After 4 months of discharge, there was no relapse of seizure. We did not restart tablet DSF considering a possibility of DSF-induced seizure. The patient is continuing to follow-up in the psychiatry OPD, maintaining abstinence now and seizure free without antiepileptic. Isolated seizure episode in a patient with alcohol dependence can be because of various reasons such as alcohol withdrawal, head injury under the influence of alcohol, or electrolyte imbalance or related to drugs. The Possibility of withdrawal seizure was ruled out as he had one episode of seizure after 6 weeks of stopping alcohol. As per family members and his gamma-glutamyl transferase level, it was clear that he did not take alcohol before admission to the hospital. As CT scan of the brain did not reveal any head injury and his electrolyte levels were normal, these two reasons can be excluded as the reason for seizure. When the patient had seizure, he was on tablet DSF 500 mg/day, tablet lorazepam 1 mg/day, and tablet quetiapine 50 mg/day. As there was no history of seizure in the past and no relapse of seizure after stoppage of DSF and antiepileptic, it indicates a possibility of DSF-induced seizure. To substantiate our assumption, we applied Naranjo Scale for adverse effect and the score was 7, which indicates its probable causal relation between DSF and seizure.[4] This pattern of adverse effects appearing with increase in duration of drug exposure has been described in the nervous system. There is literature to suggest that the latency time from the start of treatment to the manifestation of the ADR differed according to the organ. Hepatitis occurred with a distinct peak after 2 months of treatment, skin reactions peaked after 2 weeks, and the rate of neurological ADR increased with the duration of therapy.[5] There are rare case reports of seizures associated with DSF. A recent review of literature revealed few reports in which the patients had generalized convulsions.[6] Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), a toxic metabolite of DSF, increases the release of glutamate from striato-cortical synaptic vesicles, suggesting a possible mechanism for DDC-mediated neuronal damage and development of seizures.[7] Norepinephrine depletion with DSF exacerbates seizures and facilitates seizure kindling.[8] DSF has a moderate record of adverse effects. Apart from DSF alcoholic reaction, evidence suggest that DSF when used alone can cause various side effects including seizures, which are rare but need to be considered. Awareness among clinicians about DSF-induced seizures in the management of alcohol dependence appears practical to prevent misdiagnosis of seizures attributable to other reasons.

Idiopathic hypersomnia is excessive sleeping without obvious cause. Idiopathic hypersomnia diagnosis can be explained as follows: One could be chronically sleepy due to either something wrong with sleep that makes it non-refreshing, or a problem with the brain mechanisms which normally should keep one alert whether caused by primary problems within the brain or its chemistry, or by other factors (such as sedating medications or thyroid problems). A 71-year-old male who had suffered from excessive sleeping was admitted to our department for oriental treatment on 7th of July, 2003. He was diagnosed as an idiopathic hypersomnia for excessive sleeping without obvious cause. Initial treatment modalities with administration of SoonHwanGi1HoBang(循環器1號方) were not effective. However, after administration of YukMiGiHwangTang(六味地黃湯) desirable effects were seen.】",

      "abstract": "The hippocampus (named after its resemblance to the seahorse, from the Greek ἱππόκαμπος, \"seahorse\" from ἵππος hippos, \"horse\" and κάμπος kampos, \"sea monster\") is a major component of the brains of humans and other vertebrates.Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each side of the brain.It belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory and spatial memory that enables navigation.The hippocampus is located under the cerebral cortex; (allocortical) [1][2][3] and in primates it is located in the medial temporal lobe, underneath the cortical surface.It contains two main interlocking parts: the hippocampus proper (also called Ammon's horn) [4] and the dentate gyrus.In Alzheimer's disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage; short-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms.Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy.People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia (the inability to form and retain new memories).In rodents as model organisms, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation.Many neurons in the rat and mouse hippocampus respond as place cells: that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a specific part of its environment.Hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex.",

      "title": "Lithium for Bipolar Disorder: A Re Emerging Treatment for Mood Instability: Low Dosage, Slow Titration Might Mitigate Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Lithiwn is among the most effective therapies for bipolar disorder (BD), and enthusiasm for this simple molecule is waxing. The history of lithium is fascinating, (1) and recent considerations include that this element, the third on the periodic table, has few, if any, industry champions. The recent renaissance is caused by a groundswell of appreciation for the clinical efficacy of lithium and an increasing number of providers who are willing to manage patients with lithium. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Target: Bipolar disorder The target illness for lithium is BD, a spectrum of mood disorders with characteristic features of unstable mood and affect. Shifts in mood include recurrent episodes of mania, which are pathologically energized states with misguided volition and behavior with intoxicating euphoria (or irritability).(2) Psychomotor activity is elevated and out of character; speech and body movements are revved up, with a diminished need for sleep. The social, personal, and vocational consequences often are disastrous. The most common mood state of BD is depression. Depressive episodes consist of pathologically compromised energy and volition with a slowing of bodily functions, most prominently cognition and concentration; a pervasive depressed or sad mood is common but not always present. Presence of mixed states, when features of depression and mania are present simultaneously, is one of the many challenges of treating BD; an elevated volitional or energized state may occur with a depressed, dysphoric mood. Evidence for lithium Efficacy studies of lithium have focused on managing mood disorders, treating mania and depression, and prevention or maintenance care. (3) Most were performed during the 1970s and 1980s, (3) but recent studies have been comparing lithium with other mood stabilizers (4-7) and searching for a genetic basis for lithium response.(8-10) Other researchers have examined the use of lithium to prevent suicide. (11) Some have suggested a neuroprotective effect of lithium, which may have profound implications for neuropsychiatry if valid. (12-14) Results of additional studies, which are at different stages of completion, will clarify lithium use, (15), (16) and characterize the genetic makeup of individuals who respond to lithium. (17) The primary evidence for lithium, however, is for maintenance treatment of BD and for preventing manic and depressive episodes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Biochemistry and physiology of lithium. rhe biochemical and physiological effects pf lithium are complex, wide-ranging, ind likely to affect hundreds, if not thou-;ands, of genes and gene products. The mechanisms of action remain a focus of aca-lemic pursuit (for a review of hypotheses 7elated to these mechanisms see Goodwin and Jamison(2) and Can et al (18)) Lithium is involved in cell signaling pathways that involve complex molecular mechanisms of inter- and intracellular communication; (19) some neural receptors are down-regulatee (20) and others show inhibition (21) which is thought to be a mechanism of lithium. The hypothesized neuroprotective effect of lithium (22) may be mediated through an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain tissue. (14) Recently, investigators using induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons have shown that patterns of calcium-related cell signaling in bipolar neurons are affected specifically by lithium in the culture media. (23) There likely are many mechanisms through which lithium's effects are mediated, including a series of dynamic pathways that vary over time and in reaction to the internal and external environments of the cell and person. The lithium renaissance In the past decade, there has been an increase in interest and use of lithium because clinicians recognize its efficacy and advantages and can monitor serum levels and gauge the patient's response and side effects24 against the lithium level. …",

O termo transitorio e usado como demarcador de tempo, para inicio e fim da crise. A crise neonatal constitui-se a mais frequente manifestacao de disfuncao neurologica no recem-nascido, com maior incidencia no primeiro ano de vida, e apresenta risco de morte, lesao neuronal, morte neuronal, alteracoes de redes neuronais ou prejuizos neurologicos e cognitivos de longo prazo dependendo do tipo de duracao da crise. Entretanto, cerca de 40%-50% das criancas afetadas se desenvolvem normalmente. Estudos em modelos animais demonstram que as convulsoes neonatais em roedores produzem efeitos adversos neurologicos de longo prazo, tais como: deficits na aprendizagem, memoria visuo-espacial, prejuizo na flexibilidade cognitiva, comportamento autista, caracterizado pela baixa preferencia pela novidade social, deficit de discriminacao social e comportamento tipo ansioso. Com base no conjunto de alteracoes desencadeadas pelas crises neonatais em roedores, o modelo pode ser util para a investigacao da relacao entre as convulsoes no inicio do desenvolvimento e as funcoes executivas. Assim, este projeto pretende avaliar comportamentos relacionados as funcoes executivas de animais que foram expostos ao SE neonatal. Ratos Wistar machos ao nono dia de vida (P9) foram submetidos ao SE pela administracao da policarpina (350 mg/kg, ip) e os controles receberam salina 0,9% (0,1 mL/10 g). Em P60 os animais foram avaliados pelos seguintes paradigmas: a caixa de condicionamento operante e o labirinto em T. A amostra foi composta por 25 animais, 11 controles e 14 experimentais. Estes testes avaliam: aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, consolidacao da memoria, memoria de trabalho, comportamento perseverante, controle inibitorio e flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que o grupo experimental, na caixa de condicionamento operante, nao exibiu prejuizo na aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, que houve a consolidacao da memoria, nao apresentou comportamento perseverante, prejuizo na memoria de trabalho e nem comportamento perseverante. No labirinto em T o grupo experimental mantiveram preservadas a memoria de trabalho, a memoria de referencia e motivacao, e nao exibiram prejuizo na flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que um unico episodio SE neonatal nao impacta a aprendizagem associativa, a memoria de longo prazo, as memorias de trabalho e de referencia e a flexibilidade comportamental.",

      "title": "A case of clozapine-induced stuttering in a HIV-positive individual",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Stuttering, a speech disorder marked by disruptions in fluency, can be developmental or acquired. Acquired stuttering often stems from neurological causes, psychological trauma or certain medications, with antipsychotics such as clozapine implicated in several cases. Clozapine, particularly at higher doses, has been associated with dose-dependent stuttering although the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. While clozapine’s effects dopamine pathways and seizure thresholds are proposed mechanisms, movement disorders such as focal dystonia and prior extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSEs) are also implicated. Patient presentation: A 40-year-old man with HIV, schizophrenia and a history of previous severe dystonic reaction to typical antipsychotics, developed stuttering after initiation of clozapine. His stuttering was accompanied by involuntary oral movements. Management and outcome: The patient’s psychotic symptoms were found to be treatment-resistant, unresponsive to trials of two antipsychotics, and thus necessitating the initiation of clozapine. Following clozapine administration, the patient developed stuttering, which was unresponsive to benzodiazepine therapy and showed no abnormalities on electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment. Gradual resolution of stuttering was observed upon clozapine discontinuation and a switch to amisulpiride. Conclusion: Clozapine was identified as the likely cause of stuttering in the presence of additional risk factors such as HIV and a history of EPSEs. Contribution: This case highlights the importance of recognising clozapine-induced stuttering.",

      "title": "Opioids for Chronic Nonterminal Pain",
      "abstract": "This article first reviews the evidence for and against chronic opioid therapy. Evidence supporting the opioid responsiveness of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, includes multiple randomized trials conducted over months (up to 8 months). Observational studies are conducted for longer, and many also support opioid analgesic efficacy. Concerns have arisen about loss of efficacy with prolonged use, possibly related to tolerance or opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Mechanisms of tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia are explored. Evidence on other important outcomes such as improvement in function and quality of life is mixed, and is less convincing than evidence supporting analgesic efficacy. It is clear from current evidence that many patients abandon chronic opioid therapy because of the unacceptability of side effects. There are also concerns about toxicity, especially when opioids are used in high doses for prolonged periods, related to hormonal and immune function. The issue of addiction during opioid treatment of chronic pain is also explored. Addiction issues present many complex questions that have not been satisfactorily answered. Opioid treatment of pain has been, and remains, severely hampered because of actual and legal constraints related to addiction risk. Pain advocacy has focused on placing addiction risk into context so that addiction fears do not compromise effective treatment of pain. On the other hand, denying addiction risk during opioid treatment of chronic pain has not been helpful in terms of providing physicians with the tools needed for safe chronic opioid therapy. Here, a structured goal-directed approach to chronic opioid treatment is suggested; this aims to select and monitor patients carefully, and wean therapy if treatment goals are not reached. Chronic opioid therapy for pain has not been a universal success since it was re-established during the last two decades of the twentieth century. It is now realized that the therapy is not as effective or as free from addiction risk as was once thought. Knowing this, many ethical dilemmas arise, especially in relation to patients' right to treatment competing with physicians' need to offer the treatment selectively. In the future, we must learn how to select patients for this therapy who are likely to achieve improvement in pain, function and quality of life without interference from addiction. Efforts will also be made in the laboratory to identify opioids with lower abuse potential.",

      "title": "Troubles neuropsychologiques dans les addictions : dépistage, évolution et pronostic",
      "abstract": "La présentation est centrée sur une partie des troubles neuropsychologiques, les troubles cognitifs, qui sont une complication importante des consommations de produits psychoactifs. Ces troubles sont fréquents dans la maladie alcoolique : 60 à 80 % des malades immédiatement après sevrage. La nicotine pourrait être un produit stimulant de la concentration et de la mémoire de travail. Toutefois, le tabagisme chronique est clairement associé à une altération globale des fonctions cognitives et en particulier des fonctions exécutives et de la mémoire prospective. Concernant les drogues illégales, il existe un risque significativement augmenté d’altérations cognitives pour le cannabis, les psychostimulants (cocaïne et ecstasy), les hallucinogènes et l’héroïne. Le dépistage de ces troubles est important pour plusieurs raisons : – en raison de la grande fréquence des troubles qui sont souvent infra cliniques ; – les co-consommations de produits psychoactifs sont très fréquentes et il est probable qu’une association de toxiques se traduise par une altération cognitive plus profonde ; – des troubles cognitifs pourraient être un frein à la prise en charge addictologique puisqu’ils sont associés à une baisse de motivation pour le soin et à des difficultés pour intégrer les informations données pendant le soin ; – enfin, l’existence de troubles cognitifs pourrait être un facteur pronostique péjoratif (difficultés pour prendre les bonnes décisions et donc taux de rechutes augmentés). Le dépistage nécessite l’utilisation d’un test fiable, assez simple de réalisation et suffisamment sensible. Le Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) répond à ces critères et permet un premier screening. En fonction des résultats obtenus, des tests plus spécifiques, ainsi que des séances de réhabilitation adaptées peuvent être proposés. En dehors des atteintes les plus sévères, l’arrêt du toxique va permettre une amélioration des compétences cognitives qui va débuter dès les premières semaines et se poursuivre parfois pendant plusieurs mois.",

Dopamine blocking agents such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, may induce akathisia. Particular care must be taken to distinguish akathisia from psychotic agitation and restless legs. The prevalence of akathisia in patients using classical antipsychotics is 20-30% and for users of clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (atypical antipsychotics) it is lower. Risk factors are a high dosage of antipsychotics, akathisia in a previous treatment, and diabetes mellitus. The treatment of akathisia starts, if possible, with the antipsychotic being withdrawn or the dose administered being lowered. Another treatment possibility is switching to clozapine, olanzapine or quetiapine, or adding a beta-blocking agent, an anticholinergic or mianserin.",

Visual hallucinations may reflect delirium or neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Lewy body disease. This chapter focuses only on non-schizophrenic late-life psychosis. Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

Most troublesome of these are psychotic states and aggressive behavior, but a large variety of undesirable changes in cognition and affect can be induced. Adverse effects occur more frequently with higher dosages and long-term use. They can subside over time but some persist long-term. Multiple alterations in the gray and white matter of the brain assessed as changes in tissue volume or metabolism, or at molecular level, have been associated with amphetamine and methamphetamine use and the psychiatric adverse effects, but further studies are required to clarify their causal role, specificity, and relationship with preceding states and traits and comorbidities. The latter include other substance use disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Amphetamine- and methamphetamine-related psychosis is similar to schizophrenia in terms of symptomatology and pathogenesis, and these two disorders share predisposing genetic factors.",

      "title": "Tinjauan hukum pidana Islam terhadap pasal 59 ayat (2) uu nomor 5 tahun 1997 tentang psikotropika: studi analisis pidana mati bagi pengedar psikotropika golongan I",
      "abstract": "Penyalahgunaan narkotika saat ini termasuk salah satu tindak pidana yang paling banyak terjadi di antaranya penyalahgunaan psikotropika. Psikotropika merupakan obat atau bahan yang bermanfaat di bidang pengobatan atau pelayanan kesehatan dan pengembangan ilmu pengetahuan, dan di sisi lain, dapat menimbulkan ketergantungan yang sangat merugikan apabila dipergunakan tanpa pengendalian dan pengawasan yang ketat dan seksama. Perkembangan penyalahgunaan psikotropika dalam kenyataan semakin meningkat, mendorong Pemerintah Indonesia menerbitkan Undang-Undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1997 tentang Psikotropika.\r\nPsikotropika Golongan I mempunyai potensi amat kuat yang berakibat pada sindrom ketergantungan. Psikotropika golongan I hanya diperuntukkan untuk penelitian dan ilmu pengetahuan. Penyalahgunaan psikotropika golongan I sangat membahayakan jiwa dan raga dari pengkonsumsinya. Psikotropika golongan I dapat mengakibatkan gangguan terhadap kesehatan fisik, keracunan, dan gejala putus obat, psikotropika juga menimbulkan gangguan psikis pada penggunanya. Antara lain gelisah, cemas, takut, curiga, paranoid, mudah panik, disorientasi, bingung, fotofobia, mudah tersinggung, depresi, halusinasi visual, euphoria, agresif, ganggan daya ingat, gangguan nalar, banyak bicara, gangguan kesadaran, kognitif, afektif, persepsi, dan perilaku.\r\nTindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika dan Psikotropika dapat menghancurkan masa depan suatu bangsa dengan membunuh secara perlahan tapi pasti seluruh potensi dan aset berharga sebuah bangsa. Mulai dari generasi muda, kinerja manusia, dana negara untuk penyediaan obat dan pemeliharaan korban, biaya sosial ekonomi akibat penyalahgunaan dan peredaran gelap narkotika dan psikotropika. \r\nTindak pidana penyalahgunaan psikotropika golongan I seperti tindak pidana produksi, pengimporan, dan pengedaran psikotropika golongan I yang dilakukan secara ilegal dan terorganisir dengan tujuan agar psikotropika golongan I tersebut disalahgunakan, pelakunya dapat dihukum dengan hukuman mati. Karena sangat besar akibat dan bahaya yang ditimbulkan bagi jiwa pemakai psikotropika, bagi keluarga, masyarakat sekitar, dan bagi bangsa Indonesia, maka hukuman mati harus tetap ditetapkan bagi pengedar psikotropika golongan I. Penghapusan hukuman mati justru akan mengundang pengedar-pengedar dari Negara lain masuk ke Indonesia.",

Analysing such questions is indispensable during criminal actions where the responsibility and culpability of the offender is to be considered. The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness. The alcoholic state does not limit culpability, while epileptic disturbance of consciousness may exempt the offender.",

      "title": "Sensitization and Relapse",
      "abstract": "A consequence of repeated use of cocaine or other drugs of abuse is a transition in drug consumption from a casual and recreational style of use to a more compulsive and excessive pattern. Acute administration of psychomotor stimulants is associated with numerous effects that can contribute to casual drug consumption, including feelings of euphoria and increased energy, which can contribute to repeated recreational consumption. However, chronic administration of psychomotor stimulants results in the emergence of persistent craving and paranoia that contributes to compulsive drug-taking behavior (1,2). The transition in drug use from casual to compulsive likely occurs as a result of drug-induced plasticity in brain functioning that is pathogenic for the relapse of drug-taking behavior (3,4). Accordingly, identification of drug-induced plasticity that underlies the emergence and maintenance of compulsive drug-taking behavior is considered to be critical to the development of effective pharmacotherapies. Toward this end, the circuitry underlying compulsive drug-taking behavior must be delineated in order to narrow the search for drug-induced plasticity. Next, plasticity in brain functioning occurring following drug administration must be identified. Finally, the relevance of plasticity to drug-seeking behavior should be determined because plasticity in brain functioning could contribute, oppose, or be unrelated to compulsive drug-seeking behavior.",

      "abstract": "While opioid dependence has more treatment agents available than other abused drugs, none are curative. They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses. The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine. alpha-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

      "title": "A survey of peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) use",
      "abstract": "EDITOR: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants retain a vital place in anaesthetic practice. The number of available muscle relaxants has increased in recent years. All of these drugs vary in speed of onset, duration of action and in speed of offset. The manufacturers produce guidance for the use of these drugs in the form of data sheets. These may give recommendations for initial dose, speed of onset and duration of action. Clinical practice is however, likely to vary considerably with the manufacturer's guidance for the following reasons: 1. Variable individual response to muscle relaxants. Marked variation has been shown between healthy individuals for the same dose of muscle relaxant [1] 2. Renal function. Impaired renal function may prolong the duration of action. 3. Liver disease or reduced hepatic blood flow. These may prolong the duration of action. 4. Electrolyte disturbances. These may prolong the duration of action. 5. Other drugs. Aminoglycosides prolong the duration of action, other drugs may also affect the duration of action. 6. Obesity. Dose requirements are affected with variation between the different muscle relaxants. Knowledge about the state of neuromuscular blockade is important from induction through to recovery. Inadequate neuromuscular blockade during the procedure may make surgery difficult, and has the potential to be extremely dangerous to the patient. At the end of the procedure there is the potential for an awake patient with residual paralysis or for recurarization during the recovery period. Residual neuromuscular blockade may increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [2]. The peripheral nerve stimulator is not the perfect monitor; it measures neuromuscular function in the periphery, which is more sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants than is diaphragmatic muscle [3]. It may give an inaccurate test due to poor electrical contact or incorrect placement. At present, it is the most common monitor of neuromuscular function. This is due to its simplicity, ease of use, portability and cost. We have undertaken a survey to establish current practice in respect of PNS usage at five hospitals. We aimed to assess use and availability of the PNS. We also wanted to identify the factors which influence PNS usage, such as duration of anaesthesia and the muscle relaxant used. A questionnaire was sent to all grades of anaesthetist at five hospitals. Three teaching hospitals and two district general hospitals. The questionnaire asked a number of questions about PNS usage. One hundred questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 57%, of these, replies were from consultants (48%), from training grades (48%) and from other grades (4%). Question 1: Is there a place for using a peripheral nerve stimulator while using a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in your practice? Yes 89% No 11% Question 2: If a PNS is available in the theatre, how often do you use it? Never 8% Sometimes 74% Always 17% Question 3: Will you use a peripheral nerve stimulator if the duration of operation is less than 20 min, 20-40 min, 40-60 min and over 60 min? (Table 1)Table 1: Use of PNS with duration of operation Question 4: How often is a peripheral nerve stimulator available? (Table 2)Table 2: Availability of PNS in theatre (%) Question 5: How often do you use a peripheral nerve stimulator with different muscle relaxants? (Table 3)Table 3: Use of PNS with particular relaxants as percentage The response rate of 57% was disappointing but did show some marked differences. The large majority of anaesthetists (89%) in our survey have a need for a peripheral nerve stimulator in their practice. Most use it for selected cases, with a small group using it for all cases in whom a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is used (17%). This survey found that a factor affecting usage was the duration of anaesthesia with the number of anaesthetists always using a PNS rising from 11% for operations of 20-40 min duration to 21% always using a PNS for operations of 40-60 min. This may reflect the fact that an induction dose of muscle relaxant will often last between 20 and 40 min, but repeat doses are likely if the duration exceeds 40 min. There appeared to be a relation between the choice of muscle relaxant and the duration of drug action, with the least use for the short-acting mivacurium and most use for the long-acting pancuronium. It was interesting to find no increase in PNS use for the newer agents. This may reflect their predictability, although there are reports of recurarization with rocuronium [4]. It is of concern that in some hospitals there are insufficient nerve stimulators. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland recommends that a means of assessing neuromuscular block should be available whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are used [5]. In the case of one teaching hospital, 40% of respondents reported that peripheral nerve stimulators were 'rarely available' or 'never available'. While their use is not mandatory they should be readily available in every theatre complex. The results of this survey were presented to this hospital and have resulted in the provision of four extra peripheral nerve stimulators for the theatre complex. The use of the PNS helps with anaesthetic training and with the introduction of new or modified muscle relaxants but above all it may improve anaesthetic standards by preventing over- or under-curarization. We are grateful to Dr Hugh James and audit secretary Dawn Burt for their help in carrying out this survey. J. SHAH O. OWEN-SMITH S.

There appeared to be a relation between the choice of muscle relaxant and the duration of drug action, with the least use for the short-acting mivacurium and most use for the long-acting pancuronium. It was interesting to find no increase in PNS use for the newer agents. This may reflect their predictability, although there are reports of recurarization with rocuronium [4]. It is of concern that in some hospitals there are insufficient nerve stimulators. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland recommends that a means of assessing neuromuscular block should be available whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are used [5]. In the case of one teaching hospital, 40% of respondents reported that peripheral nerve stimulators were 'rarely available' or 'never available'. While their use is not mandatory they should be readily available in every theatre complex. The results of this survey were presented to this hospital and have resulted in the provision of four extra peripheral nerve stimulators for the theatre complex. The use of the PNS helps with anaesthetic training and with the introduction of new or modified muscle relaxants but above all it may improve anaesthetic standards by preventing over- or under-curarization. We are grateful to Dr Hugh James and audit secretary Dawn Burt for their help in carrying out this survey. J. SHAH O. OWEN-SMITH S.

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

The utility of continuous levodopa treatment is therefore limited by motor complications. Pharmacologic options to treat wearing off include adding (or increasing the dosage of) levodopa, adding (or increasing the dosage of) a dopamine agonist, or adjunctive treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor or catechol-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase inhibitor. Dyskinesias will respond to a reduction in levodopa dosage at the expense of worsening parkinsonism and an increase in the number of \"off\" episodes. Continuous dopamine stimulation may overcome the pulsatile stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors produced by standard oral formulations of levodopa that lead to motor complications.",

Four clinical entities are described: Wernicke's encephalopathy is the most frequent of these, with progressive development of disorders of consciousness, oculomotor palsies and ataxia. The condition regresses under massive vitamin BA therapy, but it often leaves neuropsychological sequelae (e. g. Korsakoff's syndrome). The best treatment is prevention by giving thiamine to alcoholics and to malnourished subjects who receive glucose infusions. Cerebellar atrophy of alcoholic origin is responsible for subacute ataxia which, as a rule, is definitive. Central pontine myelinolysis is rare and presents as sudden quadriplegia with pseudobulbar palsy and sometimes \"locked-in\" syndrome. Beside alcohol, a frequent cause is major ionic disorders, such as hyponatraemia or its excessively rapid correction. Pellagra is a classical disease rarely seen in this country.

Aux Etats-Unis les abus et detournements des opioides sur prescription ont mene a une veritable epidemie d'overdoses et l'addiction aux opioides est aujourd'hui l'un des plus gros defis lies aux substances d'abus. L'hypothese dopaminergique, formulee dans les annees 1980, stipule que le point commun des substances addictives est leur faculte d'augmenter les niveaux meso-limbiques de dopamine, resultant en un renforcement du comportement d'auto-administration, amenant potentiellement a l'addiction. Un nombre considerable de donnees experimentales obtenues avec les psychostimulants supportent cette hypothese qui a cependant ete questionnee pour une autre categorie de drogues d'abus, les opioides. Pour l'heroine en particulier, l'implication de la dopamine dans ces proprietes renforcantes demeure controversee, et notamment dans la phase initiale d'exposition a l'heroine, c'est a dire avant qu'une dependance s'etablisse. Dans cette etude nous confirmons les proprietes renforcantes de l'heroine a l'aide d'un modele murin d'auto-administration. Nous avons ensuite controle quels etaient les effets initiaux de l'heroine sur la souris en utilisant des indicateurs calciques genetiquement encodes, un capteur fluorescent a la dopamine et le gene d'activation immediate cFos. Nous avons cartographie le circuit implique dans ces effets initiaux en nous servant de traceurs neuronaux retrogrades et nous avons observe une activation selective des neurones dopaminergiques de la partie ventro-laterale de l'aire tegmentale ventrale (VTA), une population de neurones projetant sur le noyau accumbens. Nous avons ensuite tire profit d'outils opto et chemogenetiques, exprimes dans les neurones dopaminergiques ou GABAergiques de la VTA afin d'inhiber ou d'occlure l'activite neuronale dans le systeme meso-limbique. Ces experiences etablissent un lien de causalite et demontrent de facon non equivoque le caractere necessaire et suffisant d'une desinhibition des neurones dopaminergiques de la VTA dans la nature renforcante des opioides. Nos donnees confirment un mecanisme de desinhibition ou l'heroine cible les neurones GABAergiques de la VTA resultant en une augmentation de l'activite des neurones dopaminergiques.

Accidental poisoningThis is usually a problem of the young child or toddler, with a mean age of presentation of 2.5 years.Accidental poisoning usually occurs when the child is unsupervised, and there is an increased incidence in poisoning following recent disruption in households, such as a new baby, moving house or where there is maternal depression.

Drug abuseAlcohol and solvent abuse are among the commonest forms of drug abuse in children. Iatrogenic drugsThe commonest offender is diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil).This combination is toxic to some children at therapeutic doses.The most frequently fatal drug is digoxin.

      "title": "Commentary on Foot <i>et al</i>.: Clinical considerations in addressing comorbid stimulant use in opioid use disorder",
      "abstract": "The opioid overdose crisis has been worsened by the increasing prevalence of comorbid stimulant use together with opioid use disorder. Individuals who also use stimulants are at higher risk of relapse and treatment dropout. Further research is desperately needed to guide clinicians in the treatment of this high-risk population. The United States opioid overdose crisis continues to claim tens of thousands of lives a year [1]. This crisis has been worsened by the introduction of high-potency synthetic opioids into the illicit drug supply, but is further complicated by the increasing prevalence of comorbid stimulant use together with opioid use disorder [2, 3]. In some cases, illicit drug suppliers are adding synthetic opioids to products sold as crystal methamphetamine or other stimulants, and in others, stimulants (usually methamphetamine) are being mixed with opioids to increase the potency of the ‘high’ or to counteract the sedating effects of high-dose opioids [4-6]. Although the increase in overdose deaths is probably fentanyl-associated, there might be a synergistic increase in the toxicity and lethality in individuals combining illicit stimulants with fentanyl [2, 7]. Three effective medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorder: an opioid agonist (methadone), a partial agonist (buprenorphine) and an antagonist (XR-naltrexone) [8]. Despite these treatments, only a fraction of patients engage in treatment and, among those who initiate the medication, many continue to use illicit opioids and discontinue medication for OUD within the first few months of treatment [9]. The increase in comorbid stimulant use among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) only exacerbates these issues, as Foot and colleagues demonstrated in their secondary analysis of a series of large community-based opioid use disorder treatment trials [10]. Our experience in more recent OUD treatment trials echo these findings and has highlighted a clinical challenge for medication-based opioid treatment programs, which primarily have a medical focus. These programs may not be adequately prepared to treat patients presenting with concurrent opioid and stimulant addiction, especially those with major behavioral pathology (e.g. psychosis). Conversely, general addiction treatment programs, which are mainly behaviorally focused, might not be positioned to offer pharmacotherapy for opioid or stimulant use disorder. Unfortunately, decades of pharmacological research trials have yielded no FDA-approved treatments for stimulant use disorders [11], but there are several medications and psychosocial approaches that have proven effective in clinical trials that providers may integrate into treatment of individuals with comorbid opioid and stimulant use disorder. While there might not be an intervention reliably producing abstinence, treatments may be able to facilitate reduction of use. A recent large multi-site trial testing the combination of long-acting injectable naltrexone (XR-naltrexone) and bupropion for methamphetamine use disorder showed that the combination product was more effective than placebo [12]. Although this trial did not specifically recruit individuals with comorbid methamphetamine use disorder and OUD, XR-naltrexone is approved for the treatment of opioid use disorder, and the addition of bupropion for methamphetamine use disorder treatment in individuals maintained on XR-naltrexone for OUD is a straightforward clinical intervention [12]. In individuals maintained on buprenorphine, the addition of bupropion may also be a reasonable intervention, as its partial agonism at the opioid receptor may have some similar benefit to naltrexone on methamphetamine, although no trials have been performed using this combination. Other medication-based options include the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant mirtazapine, which has shown some promise for methamphetamine use disorder alone, particularly in low severity users [13]. There is also strong evidence for the use of a prescription stimulant in extended-release formulation to treat methamphetamine use disorder [14]. This approach may be practiced in individuals with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for whom treatment with a stimulant is FDA-approved. The use of a stimulant in this population comes with both practical and regulatory concerns due to concern for misuse and diversion, but many clinicians use this approach with appropriate safeguards (small quantities prescribed, frequent callbacks or observed therapy, etc.) with good effect. Clinicians may also consider the addition of further psychosocial interventions in this population, although few trials have been performed. In individuals with methamphetamine use disorder, contingency-based management (CM) therapy has shown the strongest evidence of benefit, although its delivery is challenging in real world clinical settings [15]. Despite the available treatment options, patients with comorbid OUD and methamphetamine use often struggle to remain engaged in treatment, and further research is desperately needed to guide clinicians in the treatment of this high-risk population. Providing a range of services is probably needed, with intensive outreach and provision of food and shelter, with a non-stigmatizing low-barrier, supportive treatment environment. Treatment must also address co-occurring psychiatric and medical problems, medications to help reduce craving and distress and decrease drug use, therapy to retain patients in treatment and teach new skills as well as connecting with peer-support networks and recovery-oriented services, harm reduction and other services [15].

Individuals with substance use disorders (eg, alcohol use disorder) are at high risk of manifesting extrapyramidal side effects or extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during treatment of alcohol-induced mental illness symptoms especially psychosis. EPS management poses a challenge since some of the drugs used for treating EPS have addictive properties. The knowledge about EPS diagnosis and treatment is not well distributed across the health system, with health workers at lower health facilities having least awareness. The present case gives details of a patient who developed EPS during the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Following cessation of alcohol use, a 54-year-old man with alcohol use disorder presented with a one-week history of visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations, illusions, insomnia, extreme fear and irritability. He was managed with several daily doses of intramuscular chlorpromazine 100 mg, whenever he woke up aggressive from sedation from a peripheral health facility. Four days after his admission, he became mute, stiff, immobile, triple-flexed, tremulous and was drooling saliva. He was referred to a secondary facility for further management while on antipsychotic medication. Finally, he was referred to a tertiary facility, managed with tablets of benzhexol 5 mg twice daily and intravenous diazepam 20 mg per day. Daily follow-up was done using the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) for EPS. EPS symptoms resolved ten days after initiation of treatment.EPS among individuals with addictive disorders poses a challenge in its management, especially in countries where the mental health care system is not well developed at lower-level health facilities. The mental health system has to prepare sustainable interventions to properly manage EPS among the growing population of individuals with addictive disorders through strengthening the mental health policy by training and equipping all health providers with knowledge and skills in managing EPS, increasing finances allocated for mental health and controlling the production and use of addictive substances.",

      "title": "Trihexyphenidyl Use Disorder and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic drug commonly used in treating movement disorders.[1] The widespread use of trihexyphenidyl has led to the exploration of its abuse potential due to its anxiolytic, euphoriant, hallucinogenic, and sexual stimulant effects.[2] It is a popular drug of abuse among the thrill-seeking adolescent male population, used either orally or smoked in a powdered form mixed with tobacco.[3] The prevalence of trihexyphenidyl abuse has been reported to vary from 6.5% to 34% among schizophrenia patients, with doses of trihexyphenidyl abuse varying from 28 mg/day to as high as 200 mg/day.[4] The risk factors for trihexyphenidyl abuse are male gender, unemployment, concomitant use of other illicit substances, family history of substance dependence, long-term use of trihexyphenidyl, and severe mental disorders.[4] The most common aim of abuse is anxiolysis, sedation, or a mood-enhancing euphoric effect to alleviate depressive and negative symptoms.[4] Even though trihexyphenidyl dependence has been previously described, the literature is scanty as it may mimic a primary psychiatric illness leading to misdiagnosis further compounded by a lack of awareness about the drug's abuse potential. We describe a case where prescribed trihexyphenidyl use gradually progressed to a use disorder, leading to social, financial, occupational, and biological dysfunctions. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old male with a history of possible dissociative episodes of unresponsiveness associated with anxiety, currently in remission and off all medications, presented to the psychiatry outpatient department with the inability to stop consuming trihexyphenidyl tablets. For the past 4 years, the patient has had bilateral fine hand tremors, for which tablet trihexyphenidyl was initiated for possible essential tremors, titrated to 4–5 mg per day. After 2 years of regular use, he noticed that his tremor completely resolved after the trihexyphenidyl dose and would aggravate after 4–5 h of the last dose of trihexyphenidyl, along with slurring of speech. Over the next year, the use frequency increased to more than 6–8 mg per day as the duration of relief from tremors decreased with each dose. He started experiencing other difficulties whenever the effect of trihexyphenidyl wore out, such as a generalized feeling of the slowness of movements, stiffness in body parts, difficulty walking, and difficulty in writing. Patient's writing samples, with and without consumption of trihexyphenidyl are attached in Figure 1. Simultaneously, he also noticed that trihexyphenidyl ingestion made him feel energetic, increased his self-confidence, and made him happier. He would get a high with its consumption and described it as if \"everything was possible\" for him. He took trihexyphenidyl first thing in the morning to get out of bed and start his day. He would also spend more money under the effect of trihexyphenidyl than his usual self, would at times be involved in activities that caused him financial harm, such as lending money to people recklessly and also experienced substantially increased libido. Over the next few months, he noticed that after the effects of THP waned off, he would start to experience low mood, reduced interest in carrying out activities, would feel that life is vain, had to struggle with all the movements and started to have suicidal ideations. Later, he started using trihexyphenidyl without prescription at about 10–12 mg per day in divided doses, sourcing it from his workplace pharmacy. He experienced side effects of the medication, like dry mouth, but chose to ignore it to alleviate the depressive symptoms. A representation of illness graph of the patient is given in Figure 2.Figure 1: Handwriting samples of the patient before and after taking a dose of trihexyphenidyl. The image is not reused from any source or copyrightFigure 2: Illness graph of the patient. THP: Trihexyphenidyl, TDS: thrice dailyOn examination, he had fine bilateral hand tremors, the speech was slurred, facial expressions were reduced, gait with a forward stooped posture and bradykinesia. On mental status examination, depressed affect and decreased self-esteem were present. He had taken trihexyphenidyl 4 h before this examination. Various differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out systematically. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was ruled out due to nonspecific motor symptoms and symptom onset only after trihexyphenidyl withdrawal. Drug-induced Parkinson's was ruled out as the current symptoms from the past 4 years have been without the use of any neuroleptics. Vascular Parkinsonism was ruled out due to prominent upper limb involvement and a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Wilson's disease evaluation was negative. With a provisional diagnosis of trihexyphenidyl use disorder based on tolerance, craving, and use despite harm and withdrawals, he was started on tablet escitalopram 5 mg and up-titrated to 10 mg to counter the depressive and anxiety symptoms during withdrawal; tablet propranolol 20 mg was started to manage the tremors, and trihexyphenidyl tapered slowly over 6 months. At the follow-up, he had decreased trihexyphenidyl dose gradually to 2 mg per day without any withdrawal. He maintained well without any tremors. Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication as a case report. DISCUSSION DSM 5 recognizes the antiparkinsonian drugs (including trihexyphenidyl) abuse under the \"other (or unknown) substance use disorder\" category. ICD 10 did not clarify any such category, and ICD 11 describes \"disorder due to use of other specified psychoactive substances including medications.\" However, it does not describe the classes of medications. Hence, whether nonprescription misuse of trihexyphenidyl should be regarded as psychoactive substance use is still questionable. The euphorigenic effects of trihexyphenidyl can be explained by the inhibition of dopamine reuptake and storage consequent to the strong muscarinic receptor blockade[4] as well as its increased affinity for dopamine receptors in the limbic area at higher dosages. Thus, it stimulates the central nervous reward system leading to a \"high.\"[5] Similar stimulant effects have been described with other anticholinergics, such as biperiden and procyclidine.[6] However, tolerance to these effects also develops fast, compelling the patient to increase the doses, which may lead to exaggerating its adverse effects and psychosis-like behavior alterations.[4] This anticholinergic abuse has also been associated with withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs in Parkinson's disease often markedly exacerbates Parkinsonian symptoms, movement disorders,[7] depressive or dysphoric mood symptoms, and even results in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[8] This could be due to acetylcholine receptor hypersensitivity in response to long-term anticholinergic use. The sudden anticholinergic withdrawal might worsen the severity of the symptoms than the initial presentation.[9] A similar phenomenon was observed in our patient, who developed motor symptoms following the discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl. Ruberg et al.[10] in 1982 reported increased acetylcholine receptor densities in the frontal lobes of patients on anticholinergics; similar changes are expected to be seen in nigrostriatal cholinergic receptors.[9] The hypersensitive cholinergic receptor state is similar to the cholinergic excess stage in Parkinsonism, leading to various movement dysfunctions. However, it is essential to mention that going by this mechanism of action, all anticholinergics would have an abuse potential, which is not evident. Therefore, the exact pathophysiological mechanism is yet to be elicited. An image representing possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal is given in Figure 3.Figure 3: Possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal effects. Ach: Acetylcholine, DA: Dopamine, \"rec\": ReceptorsIn this case, evidence suggesting trihexyphenidyl withdrawal-induced movement and mood disorders is the presence of a temporal relationship between trihexyphenidyl dosing and symptom onset which appears to be very similar to the \"on-off\" phenomenon seen with levodopa use in patients of Parkinson's disease. Among various management options, one study suggests tapering 1 mg of trihexyphenidyl every 2 weeks. Another deprescribing guideline by the University of Sydney and Macquarie University recommends a relatively slow tapering, reducing 25% of the daily dose in 1–4 weeks, depending on the nature and severity of withdrawal symptoms, and ending the treatment 2 weeks after giving the lowest dose. Nonpharmacological support such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, exercise, and social support should be given. If tapering is ineffective, consider switching to another anticholinergic agent, with minimal side effects. Tapering off trihexyphenidyl within 3 months of starting has been recommended.[5] Therefore, in light of such reported cases, it is essential to realize that easy affordability, availability, and prolonged prescription would lead to easy escalation of trihexyphenidyl doses leading to potential misuse among patients and this needs to be dealt with caution.

      "title": "Opioid Toxicity",
      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in opioid use and abuse, and in opioid-related fatal overdoses. The increase in opioid use has resulted at least in part from individuals transitioning from prescribed opioids to heroin and fentanyl, which can cause significant respiratory depression that can progress to apnea and death. Heroin and fentanyl may be used individually, together, or in combination with other substances such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, or other drugs that can have additional deleterious effects on respiration. Suspicion that a death is drug-related begins with the decedent's medical and social history, and scene investigation, where drugs and drug paraphernalia may be encountered, and examination of the decedent, which may reveal needle punctures and needle track marks. At autopsy, the most significant internal finding that is reflective of opioid toxicity is pulmonary edema and congestion, and frothy watery fluid is often present in the airways. Various medical ailments such as heart and lung disease and obesity may limit an individual's physiologic reserve, rendering them more susceptible to the toxic effects of opioids and other drugs. Although many opioids will be detected on routine toxicology testing, more specialized testing may be warranted for opioid analogs, or other uncommon, synthetic, or semisynthetic drugs.",

      "abstract": "Background: Alcohol use disorders, defined as the maintenance of alcohol use for at least a 12-month period despite negative psychological, biological, behavioral, and social consequences, are frequently associated with psychotic symptoms. Objective: Our aim in this paper is to review alcohol-related clinical conditions that are accompanied by psychotic symptoms, alcohol-induced psychotic disorder, alcohol withdrawal delirium, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, Korsakoff’s dementia, comorbid schizophrenia, or delusional disorder. Methods: This is a non-systematic, narrative review based on the relevant literature indexed in PubMed and Google Scholar databases [2000-2020]. Results: Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is characterized by the presence of auditory hallucinations or delusions. In the state of alcohol withdrawal, tactile, visual hallucinations and delusions are common. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, caused by malnutrition secondary to chronic alcohol misuse, is characterized by the presence of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and a range of mental disturbances. The dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder rests on shared biological impairments, as shown by neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies. The subtype of the delusional disorder called Othello’s syndrome, or delusional jealousy based on false beliefs of infidelity, is often seen in the context of alcohol alone or alcohol and neurological disorder. Treatment for alcoholic disorders with psychotic symptoms are dietary, psychological, and pharmacological. Conclusions: There are a number of alcohol-related psychotic syndromes, each requiring its own specific treatment approach.",

      "title": "The Treatment of Acute Agitation in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute agitation is a nonspecific term applied to an array of syndromes and behaviors. It is frequently defined as an increase in psychomotor activity, aggression, disinhibition/impulsivity, and irritable or labile mood. Etiologies of acute agitation include medical disorders, delirium, substance intoxication or withdrawal, psychiatric disorders, and medication side effects. Treatment of acute agitation requires both environmental and pharmacologic intervention. Patients should be calmed with sedating agents early in the course of treatment, allowing for diagnostic tests to take place. Failure to correctly diagnose causes of agitation may lead to delayed treatment for serious conditions, and can even exacerbate agitation.The most common cause of agitation in patients with schizophrenia is psychotic relapse due to medication nonadherence. Pharmacologic treatment options for these patients include lorazepam and antipsychotic agents. Lorazepam causes nonspecific sedation and treats some substance withdrawal, but has little effect on psychosis. First-generation antipsychotics treat psychosis and, at high enough doses, cause sedation, but may induce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Some second-generation antipsychotics have been approved for the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia. These agents treat psychosis with a favorable EPS profile, but are comparatively expensive and cause risks such as hypotension. However, avoiding EPS may reduce patients' resistance to antipsychotic treatment. In this expert roundtable supplement, Joseph Battaglia, MD, provides an overview of the definition of acute agitation. Next, Delbert, G. Robinson, MD, outlines evaluation methods for actue agitation. Finally, Leslie Citrome, MD, MPH, reviews interventions for acute and ongoing management of agitation.",

      "title": "Adjuncts to opioid therapy.",
      "abstract": "Administration of opioids to alleviate moderate to severe acute pain and chronic cancer pain is an established management process. However, advancements in clinical pharmacologic research have shown that opioids are also effective in chronic noncancerous pain. Many patients properly treated for prolonged periods with opioids develop tolerance and subsequently, physical dependence. This process is not necessarily harmful to the patient and will not cause the patient to develop an addiction (properly defined as psychologic dependence). For many patients who have been on opioid therapy for months or years, analgesic effectiveness tragically becomes less. In addition, opioid-induced constipation can be severe and cause pain; patients do not develop tolerance to this adverse reaction. Therefore, such issues become a management problem and require additional intervention. Currently, many different classes of drugs can serve as effective adjuncts to opioids for treatment of pain. Adding adjunctive medication to opioid therapy improves pain management primarily by nonopioid mechanisms of action. Clinical outcomes of such combinations include greater analgesia and attenuation of opioid-induced adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, sedation, and respiratory depression. Adjuncts include acetaminophen, antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, capsaicin, calcium channel blockers, clonidine hydrochloride, central nervous system stimulants, corticosteroids, local anesthetics, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, pentoxifylline, and scopolamine. Some adjuncts (eg, acetaminophen) are routinely used today, whereas others (eg, nifedipine [calcium channel blocker]) are used on a limited basis but have great potential for more widespread application. All professionals (eg, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, physicians' assistants, social workers, members of the clergy) involved in treating patients with unresolved pain recognize this to be an extraordinary and delicate time. It is when patients are likely to request physicians to provide some method to accelerate their death. Thus, inadequate analgesia can become a suicidogen, ie, any factor that causes a patient to want to commit suicide. Incorporation of adjuncts to opioid therapy can serve to lessen pain and improve quality of life for a suffering patient.",

It is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide, but with the availability of modern diagnostic tools and therapeutic measures the outcome has been increasingly improved during the last years. Disregarding these achievements, about one third of the epilepsies remains refractory to treatment and requires special attention of treating epileptologists and basic scientists. Refractory epilepsy is associated with a high prevalence of complications such as sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, poor adherence, cognitive decline, long-term side effects, and a poor outcome. In case of refractory epilepsy, alternative therapies to antiepileptic drugs should be considered which include ketogenic diet, hypothermia, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, propofol, ketamine, inhalative anesthetics, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, or epilepsy surgery. Particularly status epilepticus, which may be convulsive or nonconvulsive, requires aggressive emergency treatment. With the invention and approval of new therapeutic agents, it should be possible to further narrow the segment of intractable epilepsies, not only in human but also in veterinary patients. Experimental and spontaneous animal models are used to find clinically useful therapies for symptomatic management of epilepsies and to understand the basic pathomechanism of novel forms of epilepsies.",

      "abstract": "The use of cocaine, which is a stimulant substance that can quickly develop addiction, is increasing in Europe and Turkey. Cocaine use can cause psychiatric and physical diseases in the individual, but it can also cause social and legal problems. Genetic, sociocultural and pharmacological factors, some factors related to learning and conditioning have an important role in the etiology of cocaine addiction. Cocaine exerts its psychoactive and addictive effects through the limbic system in the brain, which regulates pleasure and motivation. The nucleus accumbens, which is a part of the limbic system, is the most important region that mediates the effect of cocaine. Cocaine use can often be seen together with other psychiatric diseases, and it can also cause damage by affecting other system organs, especially the central nervous system. In this article, the neurochemical effects of cocaine, related psychiatric/physical diseases and treatment options are presented in the light of current information.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

It is seen less frequently in conjunction with opioid discontinuation (opioid withdrawal myoclonus [OWM]). Only a few case reports from palliative medicine and anesthesia have highlighted the development of OWM. We report an unusual case of a 35 years old, opioid-dependent (smack) adult male who developed abnormal involuntary jerky movements of limbs and torso in the withdrawal phase. There was no change in the level of consciousness. The neurological examination as well as serum biochemistry was normal. The electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform activity. The patient was started on oral substitution therapy (tramadol 150 mg/day) after which abnormal movements subsided within 72 h. We conclude that myoclonus can be a part of opioid withdrawal.

      "abstract": "The neuropsychiatric symptoms of old patients with disturbed cerebral metabolism or blood flow mostly lead to great individual difficulties and make those patients difficult to handle: in the family as well as in hospital such patients develop alienation, isolation and therefore adaptation to a social structure deteriorates with time. In the course of a test program for medicinal therapy of this syndrome we studied the efficacy of a vincamine containing formulation (Pervincamin forte retard or Pervincamin ampoules, respectively) on the symptoms of a chronical brain disturbance. The study was randomised double-blind. We found that under the influence of the vincamine formulation the subjective symptoms, such as lack of interest, apathy, aggressiveness, raging, psychomotoric retardation, lack of concentration, dysmnesia, decreased with a statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Also the subjective symptoms, reported by the patients, such as tinnitus and vertigo decreased significantly under the treatment with the vincamine preparation. Therefore some of the parameters important for resocialisation and revitalisation of old patients could be influenced in a favourable way. Basing on the good results of our investigations, the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in old patients with vincamine containing drugs seems to be justified.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree, distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required. Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Сочетание дисфагии с нарушениями речи и других высших психических функций у лиц с последствиями инсульта делает их зависимыми от окружающих. Обезвоживание и недоедание достаточно распространены у этой категории пациентов, что требует применения методик модификация диеты. Данная категория больных находится в группе риска летального исхода вследствие развития аспирационной пневмонии, обусловленной дисфагией, а невозможность или недостатки общения не позволяют им сообщить о потребностях в питье и еде, что приводит к снижению потребления пищи, активизации катаболических процессов, обезвоживанию, появлению постинсультной усталости, депрессии и снижению качества жизни. Сочетание дисфагии и афазии у пациентов в постинсультном периоде является осложняющим фактором реабилитации функции глотания из-за нарушения речи. Без специальных логопедических занятий восстановление нарушенных речевых функций, как и глотания, затруднено или невозможно. Пациентам с дисфагией и афазией с целью стимулирования понимания речи в процессе выполнения ими инструкций по преодолению дисфагии, с одной стороны, и восстановления речи – с другой, необходим персонифицированный подход к подбору коммуникативных моделей. Соблюдение рекомендаций логопеда по восстановлению речевых функций пациента с использованием методик нутритивной поддержки (загустителей пищи и продуктов специализированного питания) позволяет минимизировать осложнения дисфагии, уменьшить выраженность речевых нарушений и повысить реабилитационный потенциал больных. В статье описан опыт применения персонифицированных коммуникативных моделей у 128 пациентов с постинсультной афазией и дисфагией. Учет структуры и выраженности речевого дефекта, правильная организация ухода за пациентами и использование коммуникативных моделей во время кормления позволили перевести больных на пероральное питание. Таким образом, использование персонифицированных видов коммуникативных моделей для пациентов с сочетанием афазии и дисфагии позволяет уменьшить или полностью нивелировать нарушения глотания, значительно улучшить состояние речи, сократить сроки реабилитации и повысить качество жизни больных. The combination of dysphagia with speech disorders and other higher mental functions in people with the consequences of a stroke makes them dependent on others. Dehydration and malnutrition are quite common in this category of patients, which requires the use of diet modification techniques. This category of patients are at risk of death due to the development of aspiration pneumonia caused by dysphagia, and the impossibility or lack of communication does not allow them to report their needs for drinking and eating, which leads to a decrease in food intake, activation of catabolic processes, dehydration, and the appearance of «post-stroke fatigue», depression and a decrease in the quality of life. The combination of dysphagia and aphasia in patients in the post-stroke period is a complicating factor in the rehabilitation of swallowing function due to the presence of speech impairment. Without special speech therapy classes, the restoration of impaired speech functions, as well as swallowing, is difficult or impossible. For patients with dysphagia and aphasia, in order to stimulate speech understanding in the process of fulfilling instructions for overcoming dysphagia, on the one hand, and restoring speech, on the other hand, a personalized approach to the selection of communication models is needed. Compliance with the recommendations of a speech therapist can minimize the complications of dysphagia, reduce the severity of speech disorders. The use of thickeners and specialized food products when feeding patients can minimize the complications of dysphagia and increase the rehabilitation potential of patients. The article describes the experience of using personalized communication models for 128 patients with post-stroke aphasia and dysphagia. Taking into account the structure and severity of the speech defect, the correct organization of patient care and the use of communication models during feeding made it possible to transfer patients to oral nutrition. Thus, the use of personalized types of communication models for patients with a combination of aphasia and dysphagia can reduce or completely eliminate swallowing disorders, significantly improve the state of speech, shorten the rehabilitation period and improve the quality of life of patients.",

      "abstract": "Intractable pain, headache or otherwise, is a devastating and life‐controlling experience. The need to effectively and aggressively control pain is a fundamental tenet of clinical care. In the past several years, increasing advocacy for continuous opioid therapy has become an important, if not controversial, theme in the development of treatment guidelines and teaching programs. Ironically, the increasing willingness of physicians to prescribe scheduled opioids for their headache and pain patients has occurred in the absence of compelling data demonstrating efficacy or long‐term safety. To the contrary, two meta‐analyses on chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) and one long‐term uncontrolled study on headache patients demonstrate a relatively small number of patients benefiting from the treatment. Recent neuroscience data on the effects of opioids on the brain raise serious concern for long‐term safety and also provide the basis for the mechanism by which chronic opioid use might induce progression of headache frequency and severity. Significant adverse effects, including influence on sexual hormonal balances, physical and psychological dependence, the development of opioid‐induced hyperalgesia, and cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death that can be seen with standard dosages of methadone, make a strong argument against widespread use of continuous opioid therapy (COT) in otherwise healthy young and middle‐aged headache patients. We believe that COT should be used in rare circumstances for chronic headache patients, and propose initial guidelines for selecting patients and monitoring treatment. The physician should be well versed in the details of opioid prescribing, administration, and monitoring, and should be prepared to discontinue opioids when clinical justification, patient behavior, or failure to achieve therapeutic goals make discontinuance necessary.",

Sometimes however, symptoms of dizziness or oscillopsia appear, due to loss of the vestibulo-ocular reflexes efficiency. A diplopia or a blurred vision by double outline could be suggestive of an ocular motor paresis or a loss of the binocular fusion due to drugs action.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC.

They mistakenly assume that starting opioids means that they can no longer expect to be alert, take part in conversation, read the newspaper, etc. There are several possible reasons why a patient becomes drowsy. One of these is an excessive dose of opioids, but there are others that must be considered. Sedation is a very common side-effect of opioid drugs. The sedative effect of opioid drugs is normally short-lived. The effect will be aggravated by the concomitant use of other sedative drugs, such as benzodiazepines. If the dose of opioid is escalated rapidly, then sedation will be a greater problem.",

From an evolutionary perspective, it is not surprising that the neurocircuitry and neurochemistry of physical pain would overlap with that involved in complex social emotions. Exposure to trauma as well as a range of gene variants in the opioid system may be associated with alterations in opioid systems function, with changes in reward processing, and with vulnerability to substance abuse. A role for interventions with opioid agents in depression and anxiety disorders has been suggested.",

      "abstract": "The number of people diagnosed with opioid use disorder has skyrocketed as a consequence of the opioid epidemic and the increased prescribing of opioid drugs for chronic pain relief. Opioid use disorder is characterized by loss of control of drug taking, continued drug use in the presence of adverse consequences, and repeated relapses to drug taking even after long periods of abstinence. Patients who suffer from opioid use disorder often present with cognitive deficits that are potentially secondary to structural brain abnormalities that vary according to the chemical composition of the abused opioid. This review details the neurobiological effects of oxycodone, morphine, heroin, methadone, and fentanyl on brain neurocircuitries by presenting the acute and chronic effects of these drugs on the human brain. In addition, we review results of neuroimaging in opioid use disorder patients and/or histological studies from brains of patients who had expired after acute intoxication following long-term use of these drugs. Moreover, we include relevant discussions of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in promoting abnormalities in the brains of opioid-exposed patients. Finally, we discuss how novel strategies could be used to provide pharmacological treatment against opioid use disorder.",

While the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown, it often runs in families, and factors like premature birth, low birth weight, alcohol, smoking, and drug abuse during pregnancy may contribute to it. ADHD is typically classified into three main types: hyperactive/impulsive type, which involves excessive movement, restlessness, and impulsive actions; inattentive type, which includes difficulty staying focused on tasks, organizing work, losing things, and being easily distracted; and combined type, which is diagnosed when both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms are present.",

      "title": "Risk Factors for Prolonged Postoperative Opioid Use After Spinal Fusion for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis",
      "abstract": "Opioids are commonly used after posterior spinal instrumented fusion (PSIF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Prescription opioids use can potentially lead to misuse, abuse, dependence, and overdose death. Prolonged opioid use has not been extensively studied in the postoperative AIS population. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors associated with prolonged opioid use after PSIF for AIS.A large insurance database was queried for AIS patients undergoing PSIF. Patients with prolonged postoperative opioid use were defined as those receiving new prescriptions for an opioid medication >6 weeks following the date of surgery, up to 8 months postoperatively. Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for prolonged opioid use were then examined, including the number of spinal levels fused, preoperative opioid prescriptions, demographic variables, pertinent comorbidities (anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism) and other preoperative prescriptions (anxiolytics, antidepressants, nonopioid analgesics, neuropathic medications, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications). Each variable's independent risk for prolonged postoperative opioid use was examined utilizing a multivariable binomial regression analysis. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 511 patients were included in the study. Of this 50 patients (9.78%) were found to have prolonged opioid use following scoliosis surgery. Preoperative opioid use (odds ratio, 2.93; P<0.001) was the most significant predictor of prolonged postoperative opioid use. In addition, female sex, obesity, a preoperative diagnosis of anxiety and a preoperative prescription for a muscle relaxer were also significant positive risk factors for prolonged postoperative opioid use. Several factors were found to be protective against prolonged postoperative opioid use. Fewer total fusion levels, compared with ≥13 levels, had a significantly lower risk of prolonged opioid use. Preoperative anxiolytic and antidepressant use were also both negative predictors of prolonged opioid use.Efforts at addressing preoperative opioid use, anxiety, obesity, and providing multimodal pain management strategies should be considered to reduce additional postoperative opioid prescriptions after PSIF for AIS.Level III-retrospective comparative study.",

      "title": "Non-Opioid Peptides Targeting Opioid Effects",
      "abstract": "Opioids are the most potent widely used analgesics, primarily, but not exclusively, in palliative care. However, they are associated with numerous side effects, such as tolerance, addiction, respiratory depression, and cardiovascular events. This, in turn, can result in their overuse in cases of addiction, the need for dose escalation in cases of developing tolerance, and the emergence of dose-related opioid toxicity, resulting in respiratory depression or cardiovascular problems that can even lead to unintentional death. Therefore, a very important challenge for researchers is to look for ways to counteract the side effects of opioids. The use of peptides and their related compounds, which have been shown to modulate the effects of opioids, may provide such an opportunity. This short review is a compendium of knowledge about the most important and recent findings regarding selected peptides and their modulatory effects on various opioid actions, including cardiovascular and respiratory responses. In addition to the peptides more commonly reported in the literature in the context of their pro- and/or anti-opioid activity-such as neuropeptide FF (NPFF), cholecystokinin (CCK), and melanocyte inhibiting factor (MIF)-we also included in the review nociceptin/orphanin (N/OFQ), ghrelin, oxytocin, endothelin, and venom peptides.",

This leads to the depletion of adenosine triphosphate, the failure of the sodium-potassium pump, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately, the release of a variety of toxic substances. Eventually these given rise to irreversible cardiovascular collapse because of their effects on the microcirculation. Shock may arise due to a failure of preload (hypovolaemic shock), myocardial contractility (cardiogenic shock), afterload (septic shock) or combinations of these (for example, anaphylactic shock, traumatic shock and neurogenic shock). During shock, important physiological changes occur in the nervous, respiratory, renal and gastrointestinal systems, as well as in intermediary metabolism. Hypotension is not synonymous with shock, and emphasis should be placed on the detection of more subtle, early signs. Management requires a systematic approach in which diagnostic and therapeutic processes take place in parallel. Particular attention must be paid to ventilation, oxygenation, fluid and electrolyte therapy, haemodynamic monitoring and, where appropriate, inotropic drugs. Corticosteroid and opioid antagonist agents probably do not have a role, but other agents, such as thyroid hormones, are under investigation.",

Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking. The findings suggest that early-onset depression is associated with a greater degree of comorbidity and may represent a more serious form of the disorder.",

The emotional outcome most often associated with stroke is depression (or depressed mood), and its frequency after stroke has led some to suggest that post-stroke depression is a distinct type. The increased recognition of mood disorders, behavioural changes, and cognitive impairment and their effects on patients, has resulted in the development of new interventions, a greater number of professionals skilled to intervene, and increased research evidence on intervention effectiveness. Psychological disorder and distress continue to be under-recognised, some disorders are incorrectly diagnosed and treated, and the relative lack of a research base means that nurses and doctors may be treating disorders in their patients without much certainty about the effectiveness of the interventions.

Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Under certain conditions, information may become stressful. In the initial stages of our research we found that informational stress can result in fatigue, anxiety, sleeplessness, and excitability. Later we found further symptoms, such as tachycardia, palpitations, chest pain, abdominal pain, increase or decrease of appetite, diarrhoea or constipation, muscle cramps, back pain, headache, tremor, dizziness, diaphoresis, tics, and so on. Some of these symptoms might be the result of cathecholamine increased secretion, others of a decrease of endogenous opioids. Because in the initial stage of stress analgesia may occur, we studied the clinical and experimental evolution of the pain threshold and its clinical manifestations. We found that after the initial analgesia, there follows a stage of hyperalgesia; the symptoms of this stage very much resemble those of the opioid abstinence syndrome. The evolution of this syndrome is enhanced by naloxone, an opioid antagonist, and it is attenuated by clonidine and propranolol, used in the treatment of opioid abstinence syndrome.

In this article, we will be discussing a young male who presented himself complaint of persistent and distressing thoughts about contamination, and on further evaluation, it was found that besides having those thoughts, he was also experiencing strong negative emotional responses to specific sounds, such as chewing, swallowing, and tapping. He was started on a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and showed a good response on fluoxetine, along with cognitive behavioral therapy, and various coping strategies that were taught to him. This case brings into focus the distress associated with misophonia which is a less understood topic and discussion of its presentation, underlying mechanisms, and treatment which are still ambiguous and require further research.",

Opioid OD is typically defined by exposure to an opioid that results in decreased mental status and/or unconsciousness, shallow breathing, constricted pupils, and respiratory depression which, if left untreated, may lead to cardiorespiratory arrest and death. The opioid antagonist naloxone (Narcan) is a first-line treatment for opioid overdose and is very effective at reversing opioid-related respiratory depression. The current chapter will review the etiology of opioid OD, including risk and protective factors, the pharmacological factors relevant to opioid OD as well as naloxone-based reversal of OD, additional medications under investigation for overdose reversal, and the clinical presentation of opioid over-intoxication and a lay-person reversal using naloxone.",

He presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms primarily slurring of speech, ataxia followed by delusion and hallucinations which resolved within 2 weeks with parenteral thiamine and an antipsychotic. Symptoms reappeared after a re-exposure, this time with more prominent psychiatric symptoms which were late to resolve (4 weeks) with similar treatment. Neuroimaging revealed hyperintensities in posterior regions of the brain which resolved after 4 weeks. The patient had prominent neurocognitive deficits which were persistent.

      "abstract": "Insight is a multidimensional construct, defined as the awareness of having a mental disorder, of specific symptoms and their attribution to the disorder, the awareness of social consequences, and of need for treatment. Although insight has been studied specifically in schizophrenia and its study in mood disorders has traditionally received limited attention, the evaluation of this concept in mood disorders is also very important because of the impact on treatment compliance and outcome. In bipolar disorder (BD), clinical insight varies substantially over time. Most researchers observed that insight is more impaired during an illness episode than during remission, in mixed than in pure manic episodes, in bipolar II than in bipolar I patients, and in pure mania than in bipolar or unipolar depression. Lack of insight is a consistent factor of non-adherence to medication in bipolar patients, along with severity of BD, side effects of medication, effectiveness, and patient-related factors. Also, impaired insight into treatment and a great number of previous hospitalizations are associated with poorer clinical outcomes (psychiatric hospitalization, emergency room visits, violent or suicidal behavior) among the patients with bipolar I disorder. In the management of bipolar disorder, improving quality of life (QoL) and outcome should be one the most important goals.",

Em algumas pessoas, a enxaqueca pode ser antecedida por sintomas como parestesia, afasia, vertigens e escotoma. Essa condição é denominada como aura, também podendo ser encontrada em outras patologias, como a epilepsia. Considera-se a enxaqueca como uma das vinte doenças mais debilitantes e pode-se relacionar o uso inadequado de medicamentos, absenteísmo, diminuição da produtividade e mudança de humor como fatores impactantes. Tendo na população, uma prevalência de 5-25% em mulheres e 2-10% em homens, sendo que no curso de medicina é de 8,5%. As crises podem ser desencadeadas por fatores ambientais, emocionais ou dietéticos, por exemplo, a mudança de temperatura, alterações hormonais, excesso de exercício físico, automedicação, poluição, uso de contraceptivos, alergias, depressão, queijos e vinho, dentre outros. A vida acadêmica, principalmente no curso de medicina, proporciona inúmeros fatores desencadeantes, como o alto nível de estresse e exigência, acarretando limitações no rendimento durante as crises. O tratamento das crises é feito de maneira emergencial na maioria dos casos, sendo que os pacientes com crises frequentes apresentam geralmente tolerância aos analgésicos comuns. Pacientes com aumento progressivo na frequência de crises, ocorrência de crise uma ou mais vezes por mês, incapacitação devido à dor ou abuso medicamentoso para tratar as crises são recomendados a fazerem tratamento profilático, tratamento que apresenta uma variedade de contraindicações e efeitos colaterais, não sendo eficazes em todos os casos. O objetivo deste trabalho é verificar a prevalência da enxaqueca nos estudantes do curso de medicina do UniFOA e constatar a necessidade da analgesia ao catalogar os principais fármacos utilizados e sua eficácia associada aos principais efeitos colaterais.",

      "abstract": "Systemic infection is often revealed by or associated with brain dysfunction, which is characterized by alteration of consciousness, ranging from delirium to coma, seizure or focal neurological signs. Its pathophysiology involves an ischemic process, secondary to impairment of cerebral perfusion and its determinants and a neuroinflammatory process that includes endothelial activation, alteration of the blood–brain barrier and passage of neurotoxic mediators. Microcirculatory dysfunction is common to these two processes. This brain dysfunction is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and long-term cognitive disability. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurological examination that can lead to specific investigations, including electrophysiological testing or neuroimaging. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis is indisputably required when meningitis is suspected. Hepatic, uremic or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, sedative or opioid withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium or Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses. Currently, treatment consists mainly of controlling sepsis. The effects of insulin therapy and steroids need to be assessed. Various drugs acting on sepsis-induced blood–brain barrier dysfunction, brain oxidative stress and inflammation have been tested in septic animals but not yet in patients.",

      "title": "Alcohol use disorder following traumatic brain injury: Lessons learned from bench to bedside",
      "abstract": "Introduction and objectives Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in a variety of neuropsychiatric disturbances ranging from subtle deficits to severe intellectual and emotional disturbances, including cognitive impairments, mood and psychotic disorders and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and TBI are closely related. The reward-mediated behaviors central to alcohol addiction seem to interact with the cognitive dysfunction of TBI. First, a significant proportion of patients with TBI have a history of alcohol abuse. Second, AUD might jeopardize TBI recovery and trigger or lower seizures threshold. Third, both AUD and TBI share a negative impact on mental functioning (from memory and cognitive performance to mood impairment). Finally, there is some limited and recent evidence that TBI can increase AUD in patients with no history of substance use prior to the injury, by disrupting incentive-motivation neurocircuitry. Methods We aim to present a 27-year-old Portuguese male patient without prior psychiatric history who developed AUD and epilepsy after TBI (from a work-related fall). Results After 3 years of treatment, the patient's hasn’t achieved abstinence. His treatment included pharmacological therapy with mood stabilizers, flufenazine injections and naltrexone, psychotherapy and rehabilitative interventions. Conclusions Given the sparse knowledge about this dual diagnosis, the approach of AUD after TBI is still challenging and the best treatment remains to be determined. Monitoring alcohol consumption should be considered in all patients presenting with TBI. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Sedation with Antipsychotics: Manage, Don't Accept Adverse 'Calming' Effect",
      "abstract": "Sedation is a frequent side effect of antipsychotics, especially at relatively high doses. Antipsychotics' sedative effects can reduce agitation in acute psychosis and promote sleep in insomnia, but long-term sedation may: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * interfere with schizophrenia patients' efforts to go to work or school or engage in normal socialization * prevent improvement from psychosocial training, psychiatric rehabilitation, and other treatments. This article discusses how to manage acute psychosis without oversedation and ways to address persistent sedation and chronic insomnia with less-sedating antipsychotics or adjunctive medications. Neurobiology or psychopharmacology? Many patients experience only mild, transient somnolence at the beginning of antipsychotic treatment, and most develop some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. Others may have persistent daytime sedation that interferes with normal functioning. Sedation is especially common in elderly patients receiving antipsychotics. Compared with younger patients, older patients receiving the same doses of the same medications become more heavily sedated for longer periods of time. The resulting sedation can impair arousal levels during the day and increase the risk of falls. Sedation can occur with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), but it is seen more commonly and tends to be more severe with low-potency FGAs than with SGAs. Clinical challenges come with: * distinguishing between sedation and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, amotivation, withdrawal, and anhedonia * determining whether an individual's cognitive impairment is related to the antipsychotic's sedative properties. Because the treatments are different, it is important to try to distinguish negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment related to schizophrenia's neurobiology from sedation related to the antipsychotic. Ask patients if they nap during the day or just lie around, and if they want to do things but can't: * If they want to do things but feel too tired, this likely is sedation caused by the antipsychotic. Treatment might be a dose reduction. * If they are not interested in doing things, the likely cause is negative symptoms. Treatment might be a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. * If they want to do things but cannot organize themselves to be able to do them, this likely is cognitive impairment. Treatment might be cognitive training or remediation. Efficacy and sedation Antipsychotics are thought to exert their effect by antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and possibly other receptors in the brain. Four SGAs--risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone--act as dopamine D2 and 5HT2A antagonists. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5HT1A partial agonist, and serotonin 5HT2A antagonist. (1) Efficacy data comparing SGAs with each other and with FGAs vary, but all 5 of these SGAs have been shown to be effective antipsychotics. (2-4) They also generally cause less sedation than FGAs. Patients with acute exacerbation of psychosis often have insomnia and frequently report paranoia that something will happen to them while they sleep. When treating agitated patients, many clinicians consider calming effects and true antipsychotic effects to be one in the same, which is not correct. All available antipsychotics are, on average, equally effective in treating acute psychotic symptoms but vary considerably in the amount of sedation they produce. Studies of short-acting injectable SGAs, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, have shown that agitation and acute symptoms can be controlled without significant sedation. (5,6) Antipsychotic effects are not immediate and historically were thought to occur over several weeks. …",

Hierzu zählen z. B. männliches Geschlecht, hohe Anfallsfrequenz, medikamentöse Polytherapie und junges Alter bei Epilepsiebeginn. Als hauptsächliche Pathomechanismen werden eine zentrale Apnoe, kardiale Arrhythmien oder Fehlregulationen im autonomen Nervensystem vermutet. Die einzige wirksam belegte Prophylaxe bei SUDEP ist eine Optimierung der Epilepsietherapie.",

These stages represent diverse neurobiological mechanisms that are differentially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use and from positive to negative reinforcement. The progression from recreational to compulsive substance use is associated with downregulation of the brain reward systems and upregulation of the brain stress systems. Individual differences in the neurobiological systems that underlie the processing of reward, incentive salience, habits, stress, pain, and executive function may explain (i) the vulnerability to substance-use disorder; (ii) the diversity of emotional, motivational, and cognitive profiles of individuals with substance-use disorders; and (iii) heterogeneous responses to cognitive and pharmacological treatments. Characterization of the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie individual differences in addiction-like behaviors is the key to understanding the mechanisms of addiction and development of personalized pharmacotherapy.",

As a part of that medications can be very helpful in managing and/or treating a variety of drug use disorders and health conditions due to drug use, such as acute intoxication and overdose, withdrawal syndromes, as well as a variety of comorbid disorders. Pharmacological interventions should be administered, when appropriate, alongside psychosocial interventions. Majority of these abusive drugs, medications or their metabolites are excreted through the kidneys. Therefore renal complications including wide range of glomerular, interstitial and vascular diseases leading to acute or chronic renal failure of these drugs are very common. The present review discusses the possible renal complications associated with pharmacotherapy",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental condition characterized by multiple psychological and physiological impairments in young children. According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "title": "Models of Pediatric Epilepsies: Strategies and Opportunities",
      "abstract": "Pediatric epilepsies are among the most devastating of neurologic disorders. The developing brain is particularly susceptible to seizures, and seizure activity early in brain development can cause profound neurologic impairment, enhance subsequent seizure propensity during maturation and in adulthood, and lead to abnormalities in cognitive function (1). In infancy and childhood, two broad categories of epilepsy are of particular concern because of their intractability to treatment and association with cognitive decline: (a) The so-called “catastrophic” childhood epilepsies (including infantile spasms, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, and the progressive myoclonic epilepsies) are characterized by numerous etiologies, by age-specific developmental windows of seizure onset, by refractoriness to medical treatment, and by progressive cognitive deterioration (epileptic encephalopathy). Seizures associated with catastrophic epilepsy syndromes tend to have bilateral/generalized manifestations: (b) Refractory partial epilepsies are often associated with dysplastic brain lesions (i.e., tuberous sclerosis complex, TSC), or severe perinatally induced injuries (i.e., perinatal stroke or hypoxia); seizures of this type may be also seen with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, but this latter condition is more prevalent in late childhood and adolescence. Often an overlap exists between these two broad categories of medically intractable epilepsies; for example, TSC is commonly associated with generalized infantile spasms as well as with multifocal partial seizures. This overlap suggests that common features may exist in the pathogenesis of different epilepsy types during early brain development. Regardless of the epilepsy type, etiology, or syndrome, the mechanisms of epilepsies in infancy and early childhood likely differ significantly from those of epilepsies in older children and adults. These mechanistic differences have important implications for therapeutic strategy and therapeutic efficacy (2,3). The lack of appropriate animal models is a major impediment to a more complete understanding of pediatric epilepsy and to more effective treatments. Animal models serve numerous functions. They provide opportunities to investigate and elucidate basic mechanisms, to test and/or develop new antiepileptic medications (AEDs) and other therapeutic modalities, to devise new diagnostic approaches, and to study the neurologic consequences of seizures at various stages of brain development (4–7). Given the many (and often significant) differences between human and animal (i.e., rodent) brain structure and developmental profiles, no animal model is likely to reproduce faithfully every aspect of a human epilepsy syndrome. However, the insightful use of such models can play a pivotal role in generating hypotheses about the mechanisms, pathogenesis, and consequences of seizures in the developing brain, and for testing potential therapies. This report summarizes discussions held during a workshop on Models of Pediatric Epilepsies, held in Bethesda, MD, on May 13–14, 2004. The Workshop was sponsored by NINDS/NIH and supported by grants from the American Epilepsy Society and the International League Against Epilepsy. Whereas previous NIH workshops have examined general priorities for epilepsy research (8,9), the current Workshop focused explicitly on epilepsies in the developing brain. Invited participants included clinical pediatric epileptologists, basic epilepsy researchers, and developmental neurobiologists (Appendix A). The general goals of the Workshop are shown in Table 1. They arose from the following questions: Given the wide diversity of seizure types presenting at different developmental ages, certain clinical questions must be considered (i.e., what clinical problems are most pressing and what additional information is needed to guide model development? Are clinical disorders sufficiently well defined to provide guidance for the laboratory researcher attempting to model a human clinical condition? How do we deal with the observation that, in humans, numerous etiologies can cause the same epilepsy syndrome (and, in some cases, a given etiology will result in different seizure phenotypes)? What is presently known about existing models of catastrophic generalized epilepsy and intractable partial epilepsy? Why has it been so difficult to develop models of pediatric epilepsies? Challenges to development of animal models of pediatric epilepsy include the uncertainty of what constitutes analogous developmental ages in humans and experimental animals (especially rodents), vast interspecies differences in the rate and patterns of brain growth and neuronal maturation, and dissimilarities of seizure phenotypes and EEG manifestations seen across different species. A goal of the Workshop was to derive recommendations on the use of current (and future) animal models, including suggestions about the appropriateness of different species, genetic background, seizure etiologies, and other clinically relevant variables. How can we generate specific modeling targets, and what criteria can we use for “validating” the models? Although broad agreement was reached that catastrophic generalized epilepsies and intractable focal epilepsies are important targets for model development, many questions remained about how to prioritize these targets (pressing clinical need? highest likelihood of rapid returns? pathophysiologic relevance?). Given the complexity of the clinical conditions in question, what subset of experimentally approachable features should to be reproduced in useful models? What are the bases for accepting or rejecting these models as clinically relevant/useful? What conceptual and technologic advances would facilitate our attempts to understand developmental epilepsies? Technologic developments, development of modeling approaches at different levels (computer simulations, tissue-culture preparations, intact animals), and consideration of animals species not currently exploited for model development may be key directions for future progress. Finally, how can we establish networks of collaboration among laboratories involved in pediatric epilepsy research, and how can our limited resources be maximized? To facilitate model development, a variety of common strategies can and should be used. A more complete understanding of salient clinical features (e.g., epidemiology, etiology, pathology, and natural history of intractable developmental epilepsies) will undoubtedly facilitate the generation of models with features that are clinically relevant. Toward this goal, it is necessary to elucidate the developmental progression of key biomarkers (e.g., neurotransmitters, membrane ion channels, subcellular signaling cascades), behavioral phenotypes, and numerous other factors to understand their relations to age-specific epilepsies. Age-related differences in neuronal plasticity and glial function are emerging as key modulators of pediatric epilepsy. Other avenues of potential importance are just beginning to receive experimental attention, such as the role of stress in epileptogenesis, the effects of seizure-induced acute and chronic inflammation, and subtle circuit reorganization associated with neurogenesis, axonal sprouting, and molecular plasticity. In any model of epileptic encephalopathy, a concerted effort should be made to determine long-term consequences of the neurobiologic abnormalities, including behavioral changes, cognitive dysfunction, and seizure susceptibility. In generating models of pediatric epilepsies, it is important to remember that in some children with an epileptic encephalopathy, the seizures themselves may be less impairing to the child than the associated cognitive deficits. In other cases, the seizures may exacerbate the cognitive deficits. Further, the effects of anticonvulsant drugs and other treatments on parameters of brain development and cognition must be considered in parallel with their effects on seizures themselves. Model development should involve, as a key goal, efficient means for the testing new anticonvulsant/antiepileptic (and even antiepileptogenic) medications, as well as for evaluating novel therapies such as special diets targeted to seizure control (e.g., ketogenic diet, low-glycemic-index diet), a variety of implantable stimulation devices (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation), and novel drug-delivery systems. These models should also allow us to test the potentially beneficial effects of environmental enrichments that may reduce the morbidity of epilepsy in children. The models should be useful for investigating if/how treatments might slow (or halt) the progression of epilepsy (antiepileptogenesis). The Workshop's recommendations with respect to general strategies for model development are shown in Table 2. Workshop participants defined an ideal model as one in which one or more aspects of human pediatric epilepsy could be studied, recognizing that inherent species differences preclude exact replication. To model a given type of pediatric epilepsy accurately, the investigator must be aware of the diversity of seizure manifestations and etiologies associated with the targeted human epilepsy syndrome. For example, what appear to be similar lesions may cause severe epilepsy in one patient and minor or no dysfunction in another. Seizures differ according to etiology, age at onset, genetic predisposition, EEG findings, treatment responsiveness, natural history, and numerous other factors. In the complex task of designing a clinically relevant animal model, two complementary approaches should be considered. An “intuitive” or “face-value” model attempts to replicate the human disease as closely as possible; this approach is likely to be high risk and may not readily yield insights into mechanism. Alternatively, a “reductionist” model isolates specific components of the pathophysiology and allows the investigator to study underlying mechanism; it may, however, provide limited data about clinically relevant behaviors and/or responses to treatment. As a first step in establishing criteria for an “ideal” model, the definition of epilepsy as unprovoked, recurrent seizures must be considered. Seizures induced immediately by chemical agents and electrical stimulation can yield important, age-specific mechanistic information. However, for a model to be truly “epileptic,” seizures should occur spontaneously, without provocation, during an appropriate age window. Worthy of consideration, however, are models in which only EEG abnormalities are apparent, or in which enhanced seizure-propensity occurs (which is manifest when the animal is challenged in some way). Second, the investigator should recognize that human epilepsy syndromes often involve multiple etiologies. An ideal animal model might incorporate similar etiologies, such as an acquired insult (trauma, fever) or a genetic mutation. In reality, it is unlikely that the most popular current methods used to induce seizures in animal models (e.g., kainic acid, pilocarpine, fever, hypoxia/ischemia) are “equivalent” to the factors that lead to human epilepsies. This lack of generalizability may affect our ability to “validate” a given model. However, because these factors can be experimentally manipulated, they give the investigator an opportunity to consider how such insults (or genetic factors) interact. Multiple insults, occurring at different times of development, may reflect a clinically realistic approach to generation of pediatric epilepsies. A third criterion for an ideal animal model is that the seizure phenotype of the model should resemble the phenotype of the seizure of interest in the humans, with site-specific behavioral manifestations. Whereas the focus of many epilepsy models has been on the hippocampus and neocortex, the brainstem and other brain regions should be considered, especially because many subcortically mediated behaviors may be critical for seizure manifestations in young rodents. Realistically, it is unlikely that rodent seizures, and particularly seizures in young rat or mouse pups, will fulfill this phenotypic ideal. It is our challenge to determine what seizure phenomena in rodents—behavioral and/or electrical—correspond to salient seizure phenomena in human infants and babies. Fourth, although species differences probably preclude an exact correlation between human and animal, EEG abnormalities should be present in the animal model; preferably, those EEG abnormalities should have common features with the human condition. For example, in the case of modeling infantile spasms (see later), specific interictal versus ictal EEG patterns (e.g., hypsarrhythmia vs. electrodecremental responses) would ideally be present in the animal model. Fifth, an ideal model would include responsiveness to syndrome-specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or other treatment modalities, as seen in the human disorder. Finally, the cognitive and behavioral consequences of seizures in an animal model should resemble those in the human syndrome. Long-standing uncertainty has existed as to whether seizures themselves cause brain damage and resultant neurologic/cognitive dysfunction, or whether underlying neurologic impairment leads to both seizures and cognitive consequences. Animal models maybe useful in sorting out these variables, because the animal-model approach offers the researcher a “normal” control brain as a starting point. Given that catastrophic epilepsies in the immature brain are relatively rare, one might argue that modeling resources could be better used to study more common—and easier-to-target—pediatric epilepsies. The Workshop participants were unanimous, however, in supporting the importance of developing a system in which we can more effectively study and treat catastrophic syndromes. Workshop participants discussed infantile spasms as an example of catastrophic generalized epilepsy, as this syndrome carries a particularly poor prognosis, and an optimal therapy does not exist (10). Infantile spasms is an age-specific epileptic encephalopathy, occurring primarily in the 4- to 10-month range. West syndrome consists of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia (on interictal EEG), and mental retardation. It may appear several months after virtually any insult to the developing brain, such as infection, cerebral dysgenesis, hemorrhage, or hypoxia–ischemia. Animal models of the human infantile spasms phenotype have been especially difficult to generate, perhaps because of our lack of understanding of the underlying causes and mechanisms. None of the recent attempts to model infantile spasms in animals has produced results that exactly “fit” the human syndrome (11). In addressing the question of what features would be important to reproduce in the animal, there was general agreement about the key characteristic factors required in an ideal model (Table 3), but considerable disagreement among Workshop participants about how to prioritize these targets. Certainly, it would be desirable to have seizures that resemble the spasms seen in infants, with sudden extension or flexion of the body, often occurring in clusters during sleep–wake transitions. Myoclonic seizures would be an alternative phenotypic target. Furthermore, an interictal EEG showing hypsarrhythmia, and an ictal electrodecrement EEG, would lend validity to the model. It was noted, however, that if hypsarrhythmia were defined to include the presence of multifocal, high-amplitude discharges, that pattern may be extremely difficult to document in a rat or mouse pup (where placement of multiple electrodes over the brain is limited by size and fragility). Therefore modeling of hypsarrhythmia may be restricted to larger animal models until technologic advances permit the development of “micro” electrode assemblies. An animal model of this disorder should also mimic cognitive stagnation or decline. Finally, the often-dramatic response in humans to administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) [or of vigabatrin (VGB) in a subpopulation], with resolution of both spasms and EEG abnormalities, would add credibility to a model. Various attempts to model infantile spasms in animals were discussed. One model involves intraventricular administration of picomolar amounts of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to neonatal rats (12), an interesting approach, given the peculiar response of infantile spasms to ACTH. Further, the perinatal stress caused by etiologies associated with infantile spasms has led to the hypothesis that stress may increase endogenous CRH levels in seizure-prone areas of the developing brain, leading to neuronal damage, axonal reorganization, long-term cognitive deficits, and possibly age-related seizures such as infantile spasms (13). The CRH-induced seizure phenotype (primarily “limbic”) and EEG abnormalities do not mimic features of infantile spasms. However, CRH-treated rats do display cognitive deficiencies. Although CRH-induced seizures are not responsive to ACTH, ACTH does reduce CRH gene expression in certain neuronal populations (14). Another attempt to model infantile spasms involves intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) in infant rats (15,16). This agent causes a clinical seizure described as emprosthotonus, consisting of whole-body tonic flexion with back-arching. Although EEG findings are variable, these seizures are often accompanied by a decrement of the EEG amplitude, resembling the electrodecremental response in the human EEG. However, interictal hypsarrhythmia is lacking, no spontaneous seizures have been recorded, and the seizures are not responsive to ACTH. Lennox–Gastaut syndrome is another age-specific human epileptic encephalopathy, consisting of intractable seizures of multiple types plus mental retardation. Lennox–Gastaut syndrome has also been resistant to animal modeling. The infantile spasms of West syndrome often evolve, as the infant develops, into the various seizure types associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. Investigators have focused on mimicking a single seizure type frequently seen in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome: atypical absence seizures (AASs) (17). Rats treated with an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis develop life-long recurrent episodes of bilateral synchronous slow spike–wave discharges (emanating from both hippocampi), characteristic of AAS; these discharges are associated with ictal clinical manifestations of staring and facial myoclonus. Later in life, these rats exhibit deficits in long-term potentiation and spatial learning and memory (18). These modeling attempts illustrate the difficulties that arise when trying to model a seizure type—and an epilepsy syndrome—as complex as infantile spasms and West syndrome. Clearly, one of the most difficult issues is the semiology of the seizures themselves. Infant rats (and mice) exhibit a variety of jerky movements and behaviors, especially during sleep (19), that can sometimes be confused with pathologic spasms. The differential occurrence of these spasm-like movements during wakefulness or sleep adds to the difficulty of the modeling challenge. Thus to be considered epileptic, any paroxysmal behaviors resembling spasms or myoclonus should be associated with an EEG seizure discharge. Ideally, a model of these pediatric epilepsy syndromes in mouse or rat would arise from some understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the disorder, an insight not yet achieved at the clinical level. The concept of “multiple hit” models of pediatric epilepsies was discussed in relation to model development for generalized catastrophic disorders. In some syndromes, epilepsy might occur as a consequence of two (or more) independent, but interdependent brain insults. An “acquired” insult (such as head trauma or hypoxia) may be superimposed on a background of genetic mutation; for example, mutation of the LIS1 gene (as seen in Miller–Dieker syndrome) is associated with neurodevelopmental pathology (20) and predisposes to infantile spasms. Such genetic-acquired two-hit models require further exploration. Whereas infantile spasms represents a generalized catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, other epilepsies appear to result from focal brain abnormalities and are reflected in partial seizures (for example, traumatic brain injury and developmental migration disorders that lead to cortical dysplastic lesions) (21,22). Discussion at the Workshop focused on TSC, a multisystem disorder often associated with refractory seizures (23); thus TSC can be considered an example of an intractable partial epilepsy of childhood. Epilepsy develops in >90% of children with TSC, and the severity of neurologic impairment in TSC is correlated with early onset of seizures (24). Because of the occurrence of multiple cortical tubers in a given patient, children may have one or several seizure foci that individually or together cause multifocal partial seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Although significant progress has occurred in understanding the genetic and molecular basis of TSC (25), still little insight into the pathogenesis of epilepsy exists in this disorder. The ideal TSC model (Table 4) would replicate the genetic defect (TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutation), the structural brain abnormalities (cortical tubers and subependymal nodules), spontaneous seizures with EEG correlates, and cognitive deficits seen in human TSC. Although several animal models of TSC are known, none provides representation of all of these TSC components. The Eker rat has a spontaneous germline mutation in which one TSC2 allele is inactivated, resulting in abnormal TSC2 gene product (tuberin). Eker rats have renal tumors and subependymal nodules, but cortical tubers are not ordinarily observed, even in two-hit models in which a somatic insult is superimposed on the genetic mutation (26,27). Eker rats exposed to a second hit do have a higher number of dysmorphic neurons and exhibit some level of cortical disorganization, but do not exhibit spontaneous seizures (although Eker rats may have a decreased threshold to induced seizures). Recently, memory alterations have been documented in Eker rats (28). In contrast, modeling attempts in mice, using conditional knockout strategies, have given rise to animals with spontaneous seizures but without the neuropathologic features typical of TSC. For example, a mouse conditional knockout of TSC1 (the gene that codes for the protein hamartin), in which the deletion is driven by the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, shows abnormal cortical excitability, astrocyte neuropathology, spontaneous seizures, and cognitive deficiencies (29,30). Complementary in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed decreased glutamate-transport currents and impaired uptake of potassium through inward rectifier channels (31), suggesting potential mechanisms for brain hyperexcitability in these mice. Still, the absence of cortical tubers weakens the validity of these mice as a model of the human disorder. Further work with the conditional genetic manipulation approach (e.g., using a neuron-specific promoter system) may provide additional insights and yield neuropathologic features that more closely resemble the pathology of TSC. A major need in developing appropriate models of pediatric epilepsy is a better knowledge base of the disorders in question. Laboratory research can contribute to that knowledge base through studies of human material from autopsy specimens as well as of surgically resected tissue. Such studies will provide a better understanding of the structural, molecular, and functional abnormalities underlying epileptic circuits. Clearly, however, this material is limited and rarely allows the experimenter to manipulate key variables. Thus animal models will continue to play a pivotal role in advancing knowledge about the developmental epilepsies (Table 5). The choice of species for these studies is critical, as species (and even strain) differences have been shown to result in very different susceptibilities to seizures and their consequences (32). The choice of rats and mice to model epilepsy phenomena has been based largely on experimental convenience and on the large background of information about brain function in these species. For studies of the genetic bases of epilepsy, mice will certainly continue to be a valuable resource (33); studies of human genetic mutations associated with pediatric epilepsy syndromes should be pursued in these versatile mouse systems. Rodents will also be helpful in assessing the roles of gender and hormones in developmental epilepsy (34). However, the sequence and rate of ontogenetic steps in rodent brain development differ in significant ways from human brain development; thus rodents may not always model epilepsy pathophysiology adequately. Consideration should also be given, therefore, to other animals such as primates and pigs, in which aspects of human brain development may be more precisely reproduced. For example, piglets are used extensively in neonatology laboratories, and experimental techniques for maintaining stable systemic parameters are well established in this field (35). In contrast, future model development should also take advantage of simple systems—such as zebra fish, flies, and invertebrates—in which large-scale, fast-throughput studies can screen for relevant genes and drug responsiveness, as well as address specific mechanistic issues (36). Workshop participants stressed the importance, particularly in these simpler systems (and in the in vitro preparations) of defining the seizure phenotype carefully. Finally, computer modeling represents a relatively untapped approach to explore certain questions of cellular and network function in pediatric epilepsies (37). In all such considerations of animal choice, the experimental question should determine the optimal approach. Extensive discussion was held regarding technical advances that might facilitate our study and understanding of pediatric epilepsies. At the top of the list (Table 5) was the development of reduced-scale (e.g., for rat and mouse pups) “neonatal intensive care units” that would allow concurrent monitoring of several aspects of neurologic function: video-EEG, motor activity, and blood pressure and respiration parameters. Metabolic parameters in young rodents, both during and between seizures, have been underemphasized in experimental work in this field; in particular, temperature measurement and its regulation are critical parameters that require assiduous attention in neonatal rodents (38). Another critical need is miniaturized systems for EEG recording, especially in freely moving animals. In the last several years, technical advances have made it possible to carry out both short- and long-term electrophysiologic monitoring of spontaneous seizures in adult rodents. However, it remains very difficult to record EEG reliably in rats younger than age postnatal day 10, and even more challenging to record from immature mice. Capabilities for small animal neuroimaging (in modalities such as MRI, functional MRI, and PET) will add significantly to the understanding of structural and functional substrates of epilepsy during development. Large-scale molecular screening techniques, including proteomics and gene profiling with microarrays, must be incorporated into experimental protocols for pediatric epilepsy studies. Finally, general agreement was reached about the urgent need to develop more precise methods for behavioral characterization and cognitive testing, to assess the long-term effects of seizures in (and on) the developing brain (39). One feature of the current Workshop was the participation of investigators working on pediatric models outside the epilepsy field (e.g., in genetics and neurogenesis, in brain development and plasticity, in sleep and mental retardation, and in pathologies associated with ischemia and traumatic brain injury). Investigators in these fields have developed modeling approaches and insights that should be incorporated into the epilepsy research arena. The sharing of such approaches, across fields and across laboratories, remains an untapped but potentially rich resource (Table 5). Innovative approaches to networking and collaboration, including web-based interactions, are needed. Such approaches would include resource “centers” that might be shared across institutions, such as rodent “neonatal intensive care units” (with video-EEG capability and apparatus for behavioral testing), neuroimaging facilities, and genetic profiling centers. Collaboration between networks of investigators, spanning the spectrum of clinical and basic research, is essential for substantial progress in the pediatric epilepsy field. The recent study by Dzhala et al. (40), which identified a novel treatment for neonatal seizures, represents an example of fruitful collaboration between institutions, involving the integration of data from human autopsy material and animal investigations (both in vivo and in vitro). The ready availability of web-based information, tissue-distribution resources, and genetic models make interinstitutional projects not only necessary but obviously feasible. Comprehensive discussion about funding resources yielded a broad array of possibilities. We, as investigators, must convince traditional funding mechanisms (including NIH and private foundations) of the urgency of research on pediatric epilepsy disorders. In addition to the hypothesis-driven NIH R01 grants, model-driven grants through the R21 mechanism should be considered. Sources of funding for pilot grants include private foundations. A listing of these potential funding sources can be found under Resources in Epilepsy Research on the American Epilepsy Society website (http://www.aesnet.org/Visitors/Research/index.cfm). Workshop participants enthusiastically supported the idea of specific model development in the pediatric epilepsies. Even in this era of limited funding, advances in the field are not only scientifically feasible but also crucial for the optimal care of children with epilepsy. Over the long term, investments of time, resources, and scientific effort should be cost-effective in terms of health and human needs. Some of the issues discussed in this workshop stemmed from the NIH-Curing Epilepsy Conference report (developed in 2000), which identified specific gaps in our understanding of epilepsy and epileptogenesis, and set specific benchmarks of attainable goals (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/about_ninds/epilepsybenchmarks.htm). Many of these benchmarks focus specifically on a more complete understanding pediatric epilepsies and their underlying bases, so that we can develop better treatment options—and eventually “cures”—for these often devastating disorders.",

      "abstract": "A stressor above a threshold magnitude, or multiple stressors applied simultaneously, cause an organism to alter its behaviour and physiology, with the aim of maintaining homeostasis. The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

For many AEDs, the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood. More than half of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieve sustained seizure freedom with their first or second drug trials. After a prolonged time of seizure freedom discontinuation of therapy may be considered; the risk of relapse after drug withdrawal can be estimated on the basis of a number of clinical factors.

Therefore, for cases in which verbal de-escalation fails, physical restraint and sedation may be required to ensure a safe environment where further acute care diagnosis and treatment can proceed., Treatment goals for this indication are rapid and safe sedation.Droperidol is a butyrophenone used in acute care settings for a variety of purposes, including the rapid sedation of patients with agitation, aggression, or who are exhibiting violent behaviour., Droperidol can be administered intravenously and it can also be administered intramuscularly, which has practical advantages when safely dealing with agitated patients. Many antipsychotic drugs, including droperidol, haloperidol, and olanzapine, have a similar adverse event profile that includes serious events such as respiratory depression, cardiac events, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).In 2001, a black box warning was issued by the US FDA for the use of droperidol based on post-marketing surveillance data., The black box warning emphasized careful patient selection and increased monitoring to prevent corrected QT (QTc) interval elongation in patients administered droperidol. QTc elongation can lead to sudden cardiac death. The extra burden placed on management of patients with droperidol has greatly decreased its use and availability in the US.The purpose of this report was to retrieve and review the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of droperidol for patients with agitation, aggression, or violent behaviour in acute care settings.

Affected children may and often do have soft signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read.

      "abstract": "Transient Epileptic Amnesia is a late-onset form of temporal lobe epilepsy characterized by recurrent attacks of transient retrograde and anterograde amnesia usually lasting less than one hour and beginning in late-middle to old age. Attacks commonly occur on waking, a potentially helpful diagnostic clue. The amnesic attacks may be associated with persistent memory complaints. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical history, wake or sleep - deprived EEG (often repeated) and/or a clear - cut response to anticonvulsivant therapy. The pathophysiology remains poorly understood. It is uncertain whether recurrent episodes of amnesia represent ictal or post-ictal phenomena.",

      "title": "Neuroanatomical and Etiological Approaches to Secondary Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "title": "Dynamique de l’excitabilité corticale dans l’épilepsie-absence et intégration sensorielle",
      "abstract": "Une crise d’epilepsie resulte de la survenue soudaine d’une activite neuronale anormalement intense, rythmique et synchrone dans une region plus ou moins etendue du systeme nerveux central. Les consequences cliniques sont extremement variees, selon les zones cerebrales affectees et la duree des crises, allant de breves secousses musculaires tres focalisees a une perte de conscience complete, eventuellement associee a des convulsions. Dans le cas de l’epilepsie-absence, une epilepsie generalisee d’origine genetique survenant frequemment chez les enfants, les crises s’expriment essentiellement par une suspension des processus conscients dans toutes leurs dimensions, y compris une interruption des perceptions conscientes. Ces symptomes sont correles a des decharges de pointes-ondes (DPO) dans les electroencephalogrammes (EEG) bilateraux. Les mecanismes physiopathologiques des alterations de conscience au cours des crises d’epilepsie-absence restent l’objet de debats intenses, opposant des alterations fonctionnelles a grande echelle a un filtrage des informations exogenes par les oscillations epileptiques. Au cours de mes recherches, j’ai explore l’hypothese alternative, mais non exclusive, d’un dysfonctionnement dynamique dans les processus d’integration sensorielle au sein des circuits thalamo-corticaux primaires. Des explorations electrophysiologiques fines n’etant pas realisables chez les enfants epileptiques, j’ai utilise un modele genetique presentant une forte homologie avec la pathologie humaine : le Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). En combinant in vivo des enregistrements electrocorticographiques (ECoG) et intracellulaires dans le cortex somatosensoriel primaire (S1), precedemment identifie comme le site de declenchement des crises, j’ai d’abord analyse les proprietes integratives et d’excitabilite des neurones pyramidaux du cortex S1, durant et en dehors des crises, et je les ai comparees a celles des neurones homologues chez des rats non epileptiques. J’ai montre que ces neurones presentent lors des periodes inter-ictales une excitabilite accrue, s‘exprimant par une augmentation de la decharge des neurones en reponse a des stimulations excitatrices d’intensite croissante ainsi qu’une tendance exacerbee a se re-polariser suite a une hyperpolarisation de grande amplitude, suggerant un accroissement du courant cationique h. Au cours des crises, les memes neurones montraient des changements differentiels dans leur excitabilite membranaire selon la composante pointe ou onde dans l‘ECoG correspondant. La pointe etait associee a une augmentation de decharge evoquee par un courant depolarisant et a une diminution de resistance membranaire. Symetriquement, l’onde etait correlee avec une augmentation de resistance membranaire et une diminution d’excitabilite. Ces changements dynamiques des proprietes integratives neuronales suggerent une instabilite des reponses corticales lors du cycle pointe-onde pouvant « brouiller » les signaux sensoriels lors des crises. J’ai teste cette hypothese en analysant les reponses des neurones corticaux, et des neurones thalamo-corticaux correspondants, a des stimulations appliquees sur les vibrisses controlaterales. Bien que les reponses synaptiques induites dans les neurones du cortex S1 par les stimulations sensorielles n’etaient pas globalement alterees lors des crises, elles etaient plus amples et plus efficaces pour declencher des potentiels d’action pendant l’onde compare a la composante pointe. Cet accroissement relatif de la reponse neuronale lors de l’onde ECoG resulte probablement de l’accroissement de resistance membranaire precedemment decrit, d’une augmentation de la force electromotrice des courants synaptiques glutamatergiques et de la forte probabilite de decharge des neurones thalamiques correspondants lors de cette composante.",

Any two of the following signs manifests catatonia: motor immobility, excessive motor activity, negativism or mutism, peculiarities of voluntary movement, echolalia, or echopraxia. 2 Motor immobility may be manifested as a waxy flexibility. The excessive motor activity apparently is purposeless and is not influenced by external stimuli. There may be extreme negativism that is manifested by resistance to all instructions or the maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved. Additional features may include stereotypes, mannerisms, and automatic obedience or mimicry. 2 What follows is a case in which etomidate produced an unexpected arousal effect, rather than sedation, in a patient with catatonia caused by a high dose of steroids.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion. Los farmacos con capacidad de bloquear los receptores de la dopamina en el cerebro, pero no unicamente ellos, causan con bastante frecuencia trastornos del movimiento secundarios. Estas alteraciones en el movimiento pueden ser por pobreza o dificultad para realizar movimientos del tipo que se observa en la enfermedad de Parkinson idiopatica (parkinsonismos secundarios a farmacos), o tambien por exceso de movimiento con cuadros distonicos o coreicos agudos o cronicos. La causa por la cual los mismos farmacos provocan efectos aparentemente opuestos no se conoce bien, aunque se supone que factores individuales de farmacocinetica, farmacodinamica y sensibilidad de distintos tipos de subreceptores desempenan un papel esencial. Desarrollo. Se exponen, divididos en dos partes segun el trastorno sea hiper o hipocinetico, los grupos sindromicos mas frecuentes, asi como los farmacos mas habitualmente responsables de dichos cuadros. Los trastornos por exceso de movimiento mas frecuentes son la discinesia aguda, la acatisia y la discinesia tardia. El trastorno por escasez de movimiento es un cuadro parkinsoniano que puede ser indistinguible de la enfermedad de Parkinson idiopatica. Conclusion. El conocimiento de la posible existencia de estos trastornos resulta esencial para la sospecha clinica y el diagnostico. En la mayoria de las ocasiones, la supresion del farmaco causal revierte los sintomas sin que hagan falta estudios diagnosticos complicados o costosos.",

The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in children does not reflect static disease entities, usually, but rather either diseases in process, which become evident in their final state in adulthood, or other social and cultural factors, such as abuse, trauma, and neglect. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states. Long-term randomized data with amphetamines indicate no greater functional benefit than with psychosocial interventions for ADD. Notable harms exist, including stunted height and possible neurotoxicity.",

Este artículo presenta el caso de un paciente de 80 años que ingresa tras un traumatismo craneoencefálico en el contexto de un brote psicótico, con síntomas como delirios de persecución, zoopsias, inquietud psicomotriz e ideación de fuga. El paciente no tenía antecedentes psiquiátricos ni deterioro cognitivo previo conocido. Durante su evolución, se perfila un cuadro clínico compatible con esquizofrenia de inicio tardío con posibles signos de deterioro neurocognitivo mixto (vascular y frontotemporal), complicando el diagnóstico diferencial con otros trastornos como las demencias. El abordaje terapéutico requirió varios ajustes, iniciándose con Aripiprazol y Olanzapina sin respuesta favorable. Posteriormente se introdujo clozapina, con mejoría del cuadro psicótico, aunque con necesidad de titulación cuidadosa y medidas preventivas ante posibles efectos adversos hematológicos. Se añadió Quetiapina y Lormetazepam por insomnio persistente y Pregabalina para la ansiedad diurna. Como efecto adverso relevante, el paciente desarrolló parkinsonismo inducido por neurolépticos, aumentando el riesgo de caídas, por lo que se implementaron medidas de rehabilitación física y estimulación cognitiva. Este caso subraya la importancia de considerar el diagnóstico de esquizofrenia de inicio tardío en personas mayores sin antecedentes psiquiátricos, y de manejar cuidadosamente el tratamiento farmacológico debido a la vulnerabilidad de esta población.",

Many of these effects take place at the mu opioid receptor (mOR), which is distributed throughout the brain. Significantly, genetic polymorphisms at the mOR may confer a greater dopamine response to the reinforcing effects of alcohol, and it has been suggested that addiction per se may be associated with alterations to the opioid system. There is evidence for the potential efficacy of mOR antagonists (e.g. naltrexone) in reducing drug and alcohol relapse, increasing treatment retention and attenuating the subjective effects of substances of abuse. Medications with partial agonist activity at the kappa opioid receptor (e.g. nalmefene) may also confer an additional clinical advantage by reducing binging following relapse.",

Dada su amplia distribución participa en la modulación de diversos procesos y funciones. Uno de estos procesos es el comportamiento social, que a su vez está íntimamente relacionacido con la depresión y la conducta suicida, sin embargo, los clínicos que atienden personas con trastornos por uso de opioides en tratamiento sustitutivo con metadona frecuentemente pasan por alto la desregulación de este sistema y su rol en la conducta suicida. Métodos: Presentamos el caso de un varón de 56 años, en tratamiento sustitutivo con metadona desde hace décadas, con buen control. Resultados: El paciente no presentaba antecedentes de trastornos depresivos. Comienza seguimiento tras intento de suicidio grave que requiere ingreso en UCI tras sobreingesta de medicación y lejía. El paciente presentaba un comportamiento social claramente alterado, en el que a lo largo de los años había presentado un progresivo deterioro de todas las relaciones sociales. Presentaba además ánimo depresivo, moderada apatía e hipohedonia e insomnio, sin otros signos o síntomas de trastorno afectivo mayor. Seis meses después del segundo intento realizo otro de características similares. Durante su estancia en UCI presentó síntomas de abstinencia a opiodes por lo que se reintrodujo metadona aumentando la dosis previa. Tras el aumento de dosis de metadona presentó una mejoría significativa en el ánimo e ideación suicida, siendo posteriormente dado de alta con seguimiento ambulatorio. Conclusiones: La disregulación del sistema opiode se ha propuesto como mediadora de experiacias sociales desaptativas, síntomas depresivos y conducta suicida. Se ha propuesto también el uso de opioides como la buprenorfina como agentes antidepresivos.",

      "abstract": "Atypical antipsychotics have, according to some, revolutionised the treatment of schizophrenia. These drugs are claimed to be better tolerated than older typical drugs largely because of their lower propensity to cause acute extrapyramidal side-effects (EPSE). Some atypicals cause little or no hyperprolactinaemia. Some are suggested to cause less tardive dyskinesia than typical drugs. Many are claimed to improve, to a relatively greater extent, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, one atypical, clozapine, is unarguably more effective than typical drugs in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Atypical drugs are now sometimes recommended as first choice treatment for schizophrenia (Lieberman, 1996; Taylor et al , 2000).",

      "abstract": "Emotionalism is an heightened tendency to cry, or more rarely, laugh. It is commonly associated with brain damage and is often distressing to both patients and carers. Emotionalism is easily confused with depression, and when severe it can interfere with treatment. The aetiology is poorly understood but its response to drugs with different modes of action suggests that there is more than one underlying mechanism. When the components of emotionalism are studied separately a wide range is observed and they combine in a more complex and varied way than commonly held stereotyped views suggest. Most patients with emotionalism are helped by simple education and reassurance. Some severe cases respond dramatically to tricyclic antidepressants, levodopa or fluoxetine.",

Patients who are intoxicated are more likely to be injured in traumatic accidents, and there is a significant association between having a SUD and injury from physical trauma. Risk-taking behavior associated with drug use can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and other infections, including those acquired through injection drug use (e.g., cellulitis, endocarditis, HIV, hepatitis C virus [HCV]). SUDs are more prevalent in patients who have depression or anxiety disorders or other psychiatric comorbidities (including personality disorders) and in those who use tobacco or alcohol. Patients with a dual diagnosis (i.e., both SUD and another major psychiatric disorder) may present with complex clinical histories and symptoms that make diagnosis challenging. Intoxication and withdrawal symptoms may be mistaken for other psychiatric or medical symptoms. Hospitalization may be prolonged by delirium due to intoxication or withdrawal.",

Nevertheless, a number of neurological adverse effects from use of medical cannabis on the short- and on the longterm have been reported, in addition to other adverse health events.It has been noticed that the use of medical cannabis can lead to a paradoxical effects depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -like cannabinoids the preparation contain. Accordingly, some neurological disorders or symptoms (e.g. multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may be caused or exacerbated by the same treatment supposed to cure them. The current review presents an update of the neurological adverse effects resulting from the use of cannabis for medical purposes, highlighting the need to weigh the benefits and risks, when using cannabinoidbased treatments.",

Este estudo tem por objetivo, descrever acerca do uso de psicotrópicos e a sua relação com a qualidade do sono no idoso. Trata-se de um estudo de cunho bibliográfico, realizado em publicações nacionais e internacionais, no presente ano, acerca da temática. Posteriormente, os dados coletados foram interpretados a luz da literatura. O uso de medicamentos para dormir, incluindo psicotrópicos, três vezes por semana ou mais, é uma porcentagem considerável entre os idosos, levando em conta os perigos ligados ao consumo desses fármacos. A utilização deste tipo de medicamento pode prejudicar, no idoso, aspectos psicomotores como a marcha, além de afetar negativamente as funções cognitivas. Portanto, sugere-se uma terapia individualizada, por períodos curtos, aliada a práticas de higiene do sono. A prescrição desses medicamentos deve ser precisa e breve, levando em conta seus efeitos positivos e negativos, a origem do problema de sono já existente e, sobretudo, a idade do paciente. Esta pesquisa proporcionou informações pertinentes sobre o uso de psicotrópicos e a qualidade do sono do idoso, permitindo a representação dessas características por meio de dados da literatura.",

Other sensory stimuli did not elicit an attack. Clinical evidence of diffuse brain damage from birth was present in all of them. The attacks developed before 2 years of age and were as frequent as 50 or more each day. Electroencephalographic recording during seizures revealed a similar pattern in all patients. Tactile stimulation evoked long-latency (60 to 125 msec), brief bursts of widespread, bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical EEG discharges. They occurred before, synchronous with, or after the myoclonus. A defective descending inhibitory system may lead to development of both the EEG discharges and the myoclonus in response to a peripheral sensory stimulus.",

      "abstract": "Amphetamines are central nervous system (CNS) stimulants and belong to psychoactive drugs that affect chemicals in the brain, nerves and exert a constant contribution to hyperactivity and impulse control. The communal group of amphetamines comprises amphetamine, dextroamphetamine and methamphetamine. Amphetamines show its action on the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system by inducing release of dopamine and to some extent norepinephrine, in the synaptic clefts of the nucleus accumbens and other terminal areas. They offer not only a sense of euphoric state, but also addiction. Amphetamines are frequently prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents and adults, narcolepsy and obesity. At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, improved cognitive control, etc. The balance of benefit/risk is the main challenge for its clinical use. When overused these medications can be highly addictive, are often diverted from the user to be used as recreational drugs. Adverse effects include anxiety, aggression, headache, insomnia, hyperactivity, palpitations, increased breathing rate, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, arrhythmia, dilated pupils, paranoia, etc. However, at large doses, these drugs may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Even higher doses may give rise to hallucinations, paranoia, psychosis and potentially lifethreatening conditions such as convulsions, stroke, kidney failure, etc. The furthermost serious health implications of amphetamine resulting from chronic use are dependence, considered by compulsive drug-seeking and drug use and a phenomenon notorious as amphetamine psychosis. Therefore the objective of this study was to explore the functions of the amphetamines as recreation drug of abuse.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common brain disorder in the elderly. In most patients who develop dementia the core syndrome of cognitive dysfunction is superimposed over the course of the disease by behavioral disorders that manifest at least temporarily to varying degrees. These include depression, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, aggression, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, delusions and hallucinations. Classical psychiatric exploration can be complemented by the use of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) which allows structured diagnosis and comparative documentation of the clinical course. The majority of psychotropic drugs used in psychogeriatics have not been specifically developed for or tested in elderly, often multimorbid patients. Substances used in psychogeriatrics are subject to special requirements due to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes specific to very old persons. They must show clinical efficacy and a low rate of cardiovascular, peripheral and central anticholinergic effects, a low delirogenic potential and favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Most of the newer atypical neuroleptics (e.g. risperidone) and the newer antidepressants (e.g. from the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, or selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs) tend to fulfill these criteria better than the high-potency neuroleptics of the butyrophene type (e.g. haloperidol) or the tricyclic antidepressants. For that reason, these newer products should usually be preferred over the conventional agents.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

Treatment was well tolerated and the side effects, consisting mainly of nausea or symptoms related with the nervous system, such as anxiety, depression, confusion or drowsiness, were mild or moderate in most cases and rarely led to the patient's giving up the treatment. The drug has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, with little potential to interact with other pharmaceuticals. It seems to have a synergic effect with modafinil, boosting its effects in the treatment of excessive sleepiness. Although it is a substance that has been used as a recreational drug, no cases of addiction or drug abuse have been observed in narcoleptic patients treated in a controlled manner.Sodium oxybate can be considered to be a first-choice drug in the treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy.",

      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

      "abstract": "Syndrome of dementia, which appears as a result of deterioration of brain structure that is caused by different factors, together with syndrome of psychomotor restlessness, represents one of the most common psychiatric conditions at patients of the geriatric population (older than 75 years). Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

Recent discoveries concerning the effects of ketamine and similar substances in the brain suggest that they may interfere with memory processes when given acutely and may affect synaptic plasticity when given chronically in high doses in certain animal models. It is thus of interest to examine the consequences, if any, of chronic use in humans. A case is here presented of long-term, high-dose ketamine use, in which the user described impaired recall and attention, and a subtle visual anomaly persisting after cessation of the habit. This history is considered in the context of other relevant studies.",

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from frequent migraine attacks or chronic tension-type headache are at risk of developing drug-induced headache (now called 'medication overuse headache' [MOH]) as described by the new classification of the International Headache Society. This headache entity is caused by frequent use of antiheadache compounds (non-opioid analgesics, ergot alkaloids, 5-HT agonists, combined preparations with caffeine or codeine) for more than 15 days/month. Most patients, however, use the medication daily. The standard therapy of MOH is withdrawal therapy (mostly under in-patient conditions) followed by prophylactic treatment of the primary headache. The relapse rate reaches up to 40% within 1 year after a previously successful withdrawal therapy. The pathophysiology of MOH remains to be determined and, consequently, therapy has been driven by experience rather than by scientific hypotheses. The identification of predictors for both medication overuse and relapse after successful withdrawal should improve prevention and therapy in the future. Several medical (e.g., class of overused drugs) and psychological (e.g., standard of performance) predictors were recently identified. Medication overuse in headache patients is based on multiple factors with physical, social and psychological impact. In view of the high prevalence and relapse rate, it is necessary to establish a structured post-treatment programme for patients after the acute withdrawal phase, which considers the predictors for relapse.",

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation.

      "abstract": "The clinical spectrum of Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis ranges from mild illusions to formed hallucinations or even frank delusions. Hallucinations occur in about one-third of PD patients treated with chronic dopaminergic therapy and are most often visual. Delusions are less common but typically consist of well-systematized, thematic ideas such as paranoia or infidelity. PD psychosis may be due to extrinsic (i.e., pharmacological treatment) and/or intrinsic (i.e., disease-related) factors. Risk factors for the development of psychosis include older age; advanced disease; akinetic-rigid motor phenotype; concomitant cognitive impairment, depression, or sleep disturbances; and multiple medical problems. When psychosis in PD develops acutely, becomes troublesome or frightening, or poses a safety risk, medical attention is necessary. Medical management of acute psychosis typically includes the following: identifying and addressing specific causes (e.g., infection, medications), reducing or discontinuing medications for PD and other conditions that may aggravate psychosis, and introducing antipsychotic medications. Since antipsychotics with dopamine-blocking properties may worsen parkinsonism, medications with greater serotonergic properties such as clozapine and quetiapine are favored. Effective and well-studied treatments that improve PD ­psychosis without worsening motor function are still needed.",

Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life.

Alcohol addiction encompasses a three-stage cycle that becomes more intense as alcohol use progresses: <italic>binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect</italic>, and <italic>preoccupation/anticipation</italic>. These stages engage neuroadaptations in brain circuits that involve the basal ganglia (reward hypofunction), extended amygdala (stress sensitization), and prefrontal cortex (executive function disorder). This chapter discusses key neuroadaptations in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic stress systems and the critical role of glucocorticoid receptors. These neuroadaptations contribute to negative emotional states that powerfully drive compulsive alcohol drinking and seeking. These changes in association with a disruption of prefrontal cortex function that lead to cognitive deficits and poor decision making contribute to the chronic relapsing nature of alcohol dependence.",

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

      "abstract": "Introduction Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone that are widely used both for sport and to achieve an athletic body image. Its use has increased greatly in recent years. The abuse is associated with side effects both physically (endocrine, cardiovascular, liver …) and psychological (anxiety disorders, depression, psychosis, aggression, suicide), in some cases severe and irreversible. Many sports supplements are contaminated with these substances. Methods Based on the exposure of a clinical case, we conducted a systematic review in various databases. Results and case report 25 year old male with no personal or family psychiatric history. It has no history of drug toxicity. Coinciding with a period of major stress (working as a private escort and simultaneously preparing exams for police) he started intensive physical training and sports supplements diet (including anabolic steroids). The patient gradually begins to appear nervous, irritable and sleep disturbance. Acutely presents a picture of delusions of prejudice, self-referentiality and elevated distress so he needed an urgent psychiatric income. Was treated with risperidone 4 mg/day and lorazepam 5 mg/day. Psychotic symptoms disappeared within two days. During outpatient follow-up medication was gradually reduced. The evolution has been favorable getting a full recovery in few weeks. Conclusions The steroid-induced psychotic episodes are rare, mainly consisting of paranoid delusions or grandeur, usually in the context of a manic episode. In most reported cases, the psychotic symptoms disappear quickly, within several weeks after discontinuation of the offending substance. Occasionally required a brief treatment with antipsychotics.",

      "title": "[Causes, diagnosis and treatment of neurogenic dysphagia as an interdisciplinary clinical problem].",
      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Dysphagia is a disruption in the swallowing process, which include difficulty in transporting (or a lack of transporting) a food or liquid bolus from the mouth through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal) according to Paradowski et al. Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes according to Waśko-Czopnik et al. are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation include history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). According to Halama radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation (Lazzar's) or tactilethermal application (Rosenbeck's) techniques which may be applied for abnormal duration of stage transition (DST). Abnormal duration of stage transition considerably increase probability of aspiration. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consist in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes--avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake. The basic principle of dysphagia rehabilitation is that the most effective way to regain efficiency is the regeneration on remains of lost function. Carrying out imperfect swallowing acts is probably the best way of increasing effectiveness and efficiency of swallowing. On the other hand imperfect swallowing acts may be hazardous because of the danger of aspiration and inhalation pneumonia.",

Many patients consume licit or illicit psychoactive substances in prescribed or uncontrolled ways. This chapter reviews the evidence of various relationships between drug consumption and behavior, with particular reference to the long-term neurobehavioral impact of drug abuse. It is commonly assumed that the abuse of most psychoactive substances results in neuropsychological deficit. Whether this attitude reflects a sense of moral retribution or the belief that repeated trips across the blood-brain barrier must exact their toll is an open question. Certainly, most psychoactive drugs affect neuropsychological functioning acutely. The acute effects can be studied in a straightforward way by administering the drug under study in known dosage to subjects and then comparing either pre-post or drug-placebo performance.",

HIE is the term used to describe the resultant condition due to a deficit in the oxygen supply to the brain. The neonatal brain can have a lack of oxygen through two major pathogenetic mechanisms, hypoxemia, which is a diminished amount of oxygen in the blood supply, and ischemia, which is a diminished amount of blood perfusing the brain. During the perinatal period hypoxemia or ischemia or both occur as a result of asphyxia, an impairement in the exchange of respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide. The duration and severity of HIE depend of the severity of asphyxia. Neonatal asphyxial encephalopathy occurs in 1–2 per 1000 births in the high income countries (Marlow & Budge, 2005; Pierrat et al., 2005; Barkovich, 2005), in low-income countries, the incidence is much higher (Ellis et al., 2000; Black et al., 2010).",

Il semble, parmi les médicaments, que l'incidence des convulsions induites par les antidépresseurs tricycliques était particulièrement importante. Parmi les substances illicites, l'utilisation accrue des psychostimulants, principalement de la cocaïne, s'accompagne également fréquemment de convulsions. Les crises convulsives induites par des toxiques sont souvent uniques et de courte durée, cédant parfois avant tout traitement. Elles peuvent cependant évoluer vers un état de mal épileptique. Si les mécanismes physiopathologiques sont similaires à ceux décrits dans l'épilepsie au sens large, il existe cependant quelques mécanismes de toxicité plus spécifique dont la connaissance peut avoir une implication thérapeutique. De même, des facteurs extraneurologiques peuvent aggraver la situation. De nombreuses complications des crises convulsives peuvent être décrites, notamment cardiocirculatoires. Acute or chronic poisoning by drugs, illicit substances, environmental agents can cause seizures with a variable incidence. Seizures may be explained by the intrinsic properties of the drug or toxic agent. Among drugs, the incidence of tricyclic antidepressants induced seizures was particularly high. The increasing use of psychostimulants, like cocaine, is also responsible for frequent seizures. Drug induced seizures are usually brief, single, generalized tonic–clonic and self-limiting. They can even stop before any drug administration. However, they may evolve in some instances to status epilepticus. The mechanisms involved in drug induced seizures are rather similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. Yet, more specific mechanisms are also encountered and they will modify the therapeutic decisions. Also, extraneurological disorders could worsen the clinical condition. Several complications are described, including cardiocirculatory failure.",

Thus, severe cocaine abuse appears to produce a neurophysiological addiction having a primarily psychological clinical expression.

Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders including chorea, dystonia, tics, myoclonus, and parkinsonism are among the multiple acute and long-term complications of substance use disorders (SUD), including amphetamines, cathinones (“bath salts”), cocaine, opioids. Although not frequently reported, they might significantly affect the lives of people with SUD. For instance, chorea, tics, and stereotypies are hyperkinetic movements reported in people taking amphetamines. Symptoms usually manifest within the first hours of drug use, subsiding thereafter. In some patients, however, movement disorders can have a chronic course, persisting even after the end of amphetamine misuse. This chapter reports the diversity of movement disorders in SUD and their clinical implications, focusing on the manifestations outside the intoxication phase.",

      "abstract": "Antiepileptic drug treatment is essential and provides excellent therapeutic effects in more than the two-third of the epileptic patients. The antiepileptic drugs influence the chronic hyperexcitability of the brain developed during the epileptogenesis. As an effect, it decreases the excitability and/or increases the inhibition of the pathological cells, which prevents the precipitation of the epileptic seizure (anticonvulsive effect). The anticonvulsive effect comes into operation by the influence of the transport of one ore more ion-channels. The anticonvulsive effect is only symptomatic and it doesn't cure the disorder. The drug selection is based on the knowledge of the therapeutic markers and the effectiveness of the drug to be used. This can occur on the basis of the action of the drug or in syndrome-specific way. The pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs determine how they can be used in the practice. The drug interactions can take place in several levels. Among them, the change of the metabolism is the most important. Acute dose-dependent side effects, organ-specific chronic interactions and idiosyncratic reactions must be taken into consideration during the use of antiepileptic drugs. The patient's individual aspects must be considerably taken into account during the treatment. There are other medical areas that can benefit from the antiepileptic drugs. Among them, the most important diseases are: restless legs syndrome, neuropathic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, essential tremor, bulimia and bipolar disorders. There are other pharmacological (adrenocorticotropic hormone, immunoglobulins, neurosteroids) and dietary methods, which may be effective at certain epileptic syndromes. The principles of the pharmacotherapy have been changing continuously during the past decades and since. New drugs have been introduced into the marketing and new expectations are coming into the limelight concerning the treatment. As a consequence this will bring on the modification of antiepileptic drug therapeutic habits.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac valve disease can involve one or more of the four heart valves. Chronic valve damage may remain asymptomatic for long periods but ultimately leads to haemodynamic overload of the heart. The most common causes of valve disease are rheumatic diseases, infections, chronic renal failure, malformations, and genetic diseases. Valve disease is often attributed to degeneration with no known cause.The frequency of drug-related valve disease has long been underestimated. Most implicated drugs have serotonergic properties, such as fenfluramine-derived amphetamines, including benfluorex. Rye ergot derivatives can also be implicated: these include dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, lisuride, pergolide and cabergoline), migraine treatments (methysergide, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine), and drugs used for cognitive and neurosensory deficits (nicergoline, dihydroergocryptine, etc.). \"Ecstasy\", an amphetamine, is sometimes also involved. The risk increases after a few months of exposure. Drug withdrawal is sometimes followed by an improvement. Patients exposed to a drug known to cause valve damage should be informed of the risk and receive long-term monitoring to detect these lesions before they become irreversible. The possible role of a drug should always be considered when cardiac valve disease is diagnosed, in order to facilitate active research and to avoid exposing other patients to this risk.",

Signs and symptoms of AW can include, among others, mild to moderate tremors, irritability, anxiety, or agitation. The most severe manifestations of withdrawal include delirium tremens, hallucinations, and seizures.

Management of AW includes thorough assessment of the severity of the patient's symptoms and of any complicating conditions as well as treatment of the withdrawal symptoms with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Treatment can occur in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Recognition and treatment of withdrawal can represent a first step in the patient's recovery process.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

      "title": "Opioid and Adjuvant Analgesics: Compared and Contrasted",
      "abstract": "An adjuvant (or co-analgesic) is a drug that in its pharmacological characteristic is not necessarily primarily identified as an analgesic in nature but that has been found in clinical practice to have either an independent analgesic effect or additive analgesic properties when used with opioids. The therapeutic role of adjuvant analgesics (AAs) is to increase the therapeutic index of opioids by a dose-sparing effect, add a unique analgesic action in opioid-resistant pain, or reduce opioid side effects. A notable difference between opioids and AAs is that unlike opioids some AAs are associated with permanent organ toxicity, for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and renal failure. It is impossible to predict in advance in a given individual what opioid dose they may require to control cancer pain. Most AAs have a ceiling effect for their analgesic actions, but often with continued dose-related toxicities and side effects (with the exception of glucocorticoids). The blood levels of opioids (and their metabolites) can be measured with great precision and accuracy. There is sometimes a role for drug blood levels of certain AAs, like tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants when used for neuropathic pain. Age affects metabolism of most opioids. The therapeutic window of opioids is wide, with no ceiling effect. Most AAs (except corticosteroids) have a narrow therapeutic window. Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that competes and displaces opioids from their receptor sites. All clinically useful opioids are mu opioid receptor agonists. Not all routes of administration are available to all opioids. Adjuvant analgesics lack the versatility in routes of administration that opioids possess. Dosing flexibility is a major advantage when treating cancer-related pain with opioids. Dose flexibility is much less with AAs than opioids. Unlike opioids, the analgesic response is usually observed within hours to days of attaining an adequate dose with most AAs (1-2 days). Rotation among opioids is a useful therapeutic strategy to improve analgesic response or minimize toxicity. Most AAs are unsuitable for rescue dosing because of their pharmacological characteristics. The mu agonist side effect profile is similar among the different opioid agents, regardless of the route of administration. The appropriate use of AAs will reduce opioid-related side effects. No apparent tolerance to analgesia develops with AAs. Abrupt discontinuation of an opioid after chronic repeated use for more than a few days will cause a withdrawal syndrome of variable severity. Adjuvant analgesics are an essential tool in cancer pain.",

The object of the following case report is to point out the difficulty of making a differential diagnosis between these two entities. Case summary A 49-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital after presenting with auditory and visual hallucinations, formal thought disorder, persecutory delusions, ideas of reference, insomnia. Memory, executive function and attentional tasks were severely compromised. Computerized tomography showed incipient frontal lobe atrophy. There were no significant abnormalities found in blood and urine samples or physical and neurological examinations. After showing no response to olanzapine, and extrapyramidal side effects to fluphenazine, risperidone was initiated which subsequently led to complete withdrawal of positive symptoms. Discussion Patients presenting with psychotic symptoms after the age of 40 presented a diagnostic quandary, as they were less likely to present with negative symptoms, formal thought disorder or affective blunting, and more likely to have systematised delusions and visual hallucinations. Frontotemporal dementia is a disorder that can present itself with cognitive decline and a large range of psychiatric symptoms. The risk of late onset schizophrenia is greater in women, possibly implicating a causative role of female sex hormones. Atypical antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine seem to be an adequate treatment. Conclusion Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease with a large variety of clinical manifestations. Special care should be given to patients with age over 40, including neurocognitive assessment, laboratory and hormone tests, and a long-term follow-up.

Delirium is usually temporary and reversible and does not reflect a persistent psychiatric disorder.1 Delirium may result from a general medical condition, from use of drugs or similar substances, or from withdrawal from these substances. Some researchers suggest that there are two forms of delirium: hyperactive (agitated) and hypoactive (lethargic). If individuals with delirium experience the hyperactive form, they may be more prone to hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and disorientation. The rate is higher in elderly persons, those with cancer, and those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients who have had an operation (especially heart surgery, hip surgery, and organ transplants), as well as patients with burns, dialysis, or central nervous system lesions, are at increased risk for delirium.

      "abstract": "Description/clinical case A. is a 10-year-old girl of Moroccan origin appearing in pediatric specialist of A.P repeatedly by unspecific stomachache, nausea and vomiting. After several visits to the same reason for consulting an exploratory interview alone with the patient in that regard that “sometimes when calms nervous scratching the walls and eating them” is performed. The mother says intrafamily difficulties. Information reported by the patient's mother confirms next visit also providing pictures on the wall of your room is returned. Referral to child and adolescent mental health is decided. Exploration/complementary tests There is no single test for pica. It is carried out systematic blood, biochemical (iron, zinc, lead…) to assess toxic substances and nutritional levels. Abdominal Rx. Both normal. Diagnosis Pica (F98.3). Differential diagnosis Ingestion of nutrients can occur in the course of other mental disorders (for example, a pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia), mental retardation, in the Kleine–Levin syndrome… In these cases, should only be established an additional diagnosis of pica if the feeding behavior is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Conclusions Pica disorder has been studied by pediatricians, gynecologists, dermatologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, nutritionists, anthropologists, etc., which has been interpreted as a conduct disorder, food, mental illness, poverty, hunger… but really the cause it is unknown. Although morbidity and mortality is unknown and difficult to study, include poisonings, parasitosis and surgical abdomen as serious complications. Finally, like all other eating disorders, the overall management of this entity requires the coordinated intervention of various professionals.

      "title": "Hypnodiagnostic and Hypnotherapeutic Fantasy-Evocation and Acting-out Techniques",
      "abstract": "Abstract During the past five years, we have been experimenting with a number of hypnotic techniques with which to reach patients who have little or no motivation, at least at first, for psychotherapy. For the most part, these techniques have been utilized with patients with real or apparent medical or surgical disease, who had been, so far as can be judged, medically or surgically sick for five, ten or more years. The more usual interviewing techniques frequently could give us no clues, even so far as differential diagnosis (of organic from emotional disease) was concerned. As a result, techniques were devised whereby these patients were hypnotized, sometimes without their knowledge or conscious consent, but nevertheless always with their consent implied, without at any time using the word “sleep” or suggesting eye-closure, so that, by the use of other techniques still under investigation, symptoms could be precipitated or intensified even to the point of having asthmatic or epileptic attacks reproduced, for instance, during the consultation session. By still other techniques, symptom-formation was then blocked and the inevitable, resultant anxiety reaction repressed, so that underlying fantasies could erupt into conscious awareness even to the point of being acted out. An asthmatic patient, for example, when his asthmatic attack was blocked, acted out the killing of his girl friend by knocking her to the floor and jumping over and over again on her abdomen. An adolescent, with what was thought to be probable extra-pyramidal disease, began to masturbate. Examples could be multiplied almost ad inftnitum In all cases, symptoms served more than one function, and several such functions would be acted out either concurrently or one after the other. Such reactions have been utilized for the purpose of differential diagnosis, but not in the more usual sense of the term. We cannot, for instance, say that these patients do not have asthma, epilepsy, etc. By means of these techniques, however, we have found it possible to determine, and to determine rapidly, the neurotic or psychotic functions which their symptoms serve, and, in addition, to state further that, irrespective of whether or not it be asthma, epilepsy, etc., specific patients with these diagnoses can be helped and even “cured,” after having been taken partly or completely off medication, by psychiatric treatment. This can proceed in two different ways: (a) With patients who are poorly motivated toward treatment, substitute symptoms may be set up, provided they serve the same neurotic needs, or other specifically hypnotherapeutic techniques utilized. (b) Patients who can come into a good therapeutic relationship, sometimes as a result of the hypnodiagnostic procedures listed above, can then be treated both (1) by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques, either on non-hypnotic or hypnotic levels, and, in addition, (2) by techniques made possible only by the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. Some of these, again, are acting-out techniques. There is little in the whole field of hypnotherapy that is not controversial. This applies even to a definition of hypnosis. However, from the angle of approach of the material presented in this chapter, we tentatively incline to believe that whatever else, in addition, the hypnotic interpersonal relationship is, it seems to be a fantasy-evoking one in which the patient, on the basis of his own experiential background and with more ready access to his pre-conscious, thinks, feels, experiences, reacts and even acts-out exactly as he believes the hypnotist wishes him to, projecting his own impulses, desires and fantasies to the therapist. Or—and this is of course the same thing—his reaction may negativistically be the very opposite of this. For this reason, when techniques of this type are utilized, no direct suggestion at any time is given the patient. When treatment of this type is decided upon, calculated risks must at times be taken. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting-out by the patient of the fantasies of the therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided.",

      "title": "Smartphone addiction through age and gender during Italian lockdown for COVID-19",
      "abstract": "Background: Nomophobia (no-mobile-phobia or Disconnection Syndrome) is the fear of not being able to consult your mobile phone, not being connected or traceable. This is an addiction to excessive smartphone usage related to the constant need to consult it to view notifications and updates. Like other forms of addiction, nomophobia is associated with excessive behaviors that lead to an increasing use of the phone to the point where it cannot do without it and the need to take it with it to any place or circumstance. The fear of not being connected consequently evokes reactions of excessive anxiety with specific physiological related (e.g., breathlessness, sweating, tremor, heart acceleration, sweating etc.). Nomophobia, however, is not included in anxiety disorders but is part of the pathological addictions to which it responds adequately. In fact, there are many behavioral and emotional analogies with other forms of addiction (including gambling) so the hypothesis that the abuse of the smartphone should be categorized as a real addiction can be accepted. The dependencies associated with the Internet and technologies that can be defined Dependencies 2.0, include the smartphone. During the Italian lockdown caused by COVID-19, the use of technologies has been the fundamental basis of adaptation for smart working, school and professional training, which has led to a change in the population lifestyle. Objective: The purpose of this work is to document the level of smartphone dependence that has occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Material and Methods: The NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire (NMP-Q) was presented online to 1264 participants between the ages of 15 and 60. With regard to the selection of participants, approximately between the ages of 15 and 60, we used the method of random numbers: in fact, one participant for every hundred inhabitants was chosen in a randomized way. Finally, it was necessary for all participants to have access to the Internet. These dynamics have been acquitted in order to give us a valid representative sample. Results: The results show no significant main effects for the two factors taken into account (Gender and Age of participants). However the significant interaction shows that female participants reported on average higher scores on NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire (NMP-Q) than males , for the younger age group (15 to 44), while for those over the age of 44, the average highest scores were for male participants. The main effects of the \"Sex\" factor [F(1,1256)= 3.179 and p=0.75] and \"Age_class\" [F(4,1253)=1.82 and p=0.12] are not significant; the interaction between the Sex-Age_class factors is significant with F(4,1253) =7.06 and p<.001 and an observed power close to 1 (0.99). The correlation between the Variable \"Score\" and the measure of the \"Age\" was found to be significant (negative) linear relationship (r of Pearson =-.093 and p<.001) considering the whole sample. Conclusions: One of the \"positive\" aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is the use of the Internet and smartphones, and our analysis aimed to document the frequency of use in the Italian context with the NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire. The results reveal the risk in some parts of the Italian population to develop forms of smartphone dependence, especially in circumstances that prohibit direct social interactions.",

      "title": "Substance Abuse: Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "Used appropriately, sedative–hypnotics improve the quality of life for the vast majority of patients who take them. Adverse consequences of their use may include unrecognized memory impairment, physiological dependence, and substance disorders of abuse or dependence. In the elderly, sedative–hypnotics may increase the risk of falls and confusion. Short-acting barbiturates and the older sedative–hypnotics can be lethal if taken in overdose. Benzodiazepines and the newer nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have a greater margin of safety profile with regard to overdose. The benzodiazepines and newer hypnotics are commonly used by drug abusers, but are rarely used as primary intoxicants. Abuse and dependence and physiological dependence may occur. This chapter focuses on abuse potential, diagnosis of dependence and treatment of benzodiazepine and other sedative–hypnotic drug dependence. Newer nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics—zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone, and zopiclone—are covered in detail because they are now the most commonly prescribed hypnotics, and the manifestations of abuse and dependence and the pharmacotherapy of dependence are less well known. Emphasis is placed on the more recent literature and reviews. Management of physiological dependence is covered in detail. The clinical and biological rationale for using phenobarbital for treatment of physical dependence on sedative–hypnotics is developed, and phenobarbital withdrawal conversions are provided for common benzodiazepines and other sedative–hypnotics. Common issues that arise during evaluation and treatment of sedative–hypnotic dependence are illustrated with case vignettes.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a maldevelopmental disease with multifactorial etiopathogenesis linked to disturbances in the prenatal/ perinatal environment and to social factors and/or addictive drugs consumption during adolescence/young adulthood. Adolescence has been demonstrated to represent a very sensitive period for brain development. Exposure to adverse life events (chronic social isolation and/or instability) and/or addictive drugs (opioids, cocaine, cannabinoids, alcohol, nicotine) during adolescence has been linked to deviations in the normal neurodevelopment, producing a brain particularly at risk of mental diseases. Several psychopharmacological drugs and environmental factors have been reported to protect against the detrimental effect on neurogenesis caused by the aforementioned genetic and/or epigenetic vulnerabilities.

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

There is evidence that, in some ADD/ADHD children, there might be decreased levels of metabolism of catecholamine, brain chemicals related to adrenalin (epinephrine) and noradrenalin (norepinephrine) (Lubar, hand-out). Because of this, stimulant medications are often effective treatments for these children, especially in reducing hyperactivity. Children on the medication often show improved attentiveness and decreased impulsivity. However, a significant problem with the pharmacological treatment of ADD children is the statedependent and shortlived effects. For example, the frequently prescribed medication Ritalin (Methylphenidate) lasts only for 3 or 4 hours in the nervous system. As soon as the medication wears off, full blown symptoms of ADD and ADHD appear (Lubar, hand-out). Furthermore, Ritalin has numerous undesirable side-effects such as insomnia, loss of appetite, inhibited growth, and depression.",

      "title": "Smell Loss and Onset of Phantosmia are Critical Aspects of Head Injury Cognition",
      "abstract": "Head injury is a common event occurring in 1–2 million people in the U.S. yearly. Head injuries may cause minor inconvenience or it may induce major cognitive changes such as memory loss, concentration difficulties, headache, hearing loss, and visual difficulties, associated with or without loss of consciousness. Two of the major events occurring after head injuries which are not commonly recognized but which significantly alter behavior are loss of smell acuity and subsequent onset of smell distortions or phantosmia. Most patients are unaware that these two events can occur but they are present in most patients who experience head injury of any severity. Initially, patients recognize that they cannot recognize any odors and subsequently recognize that they cannot obtain any flavor from any food or drink. Over time they recognize that they experience a peculiar, usually unpleasant, odor in their nose in absence of any external odor. These odors may be persistent or transient, usually unpleasant, and may be described as fecal‐like, burned, chemical‐like, or metallic. The phantom, if persistent, can be severe enough to initiate loss of appetite with subsequent weight loss and depression. We have evaluated over 200 patients with smell loss and phantosmia after a head injury at The Taste and Smell Clinic in Washington, DC over the past 40 years attempting to understand their cognitive changes in smell function. We have found that the mechanism for these cognitive changes relate to metabolic changes mainly in biochemical changes in both sensory and brain function in which specific growth factors which maintain olfactory function have been diminished and specific brain neurotransmitters, mainly gamma‐aminobutyric acid, have also been diminished. Correction of these abnormalities commonly corrects the smell loss, inhibits the phantosmia and improves cognition.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric illness is common, affecting up to 10% of the population, with around 1% diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder. An increased mortality rate in the postoperative period for schizophrenic patients receiving chronic antipsychotic therapy has been demonstrated. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disease, schizophrenia-associated psychotic disorders are characterized by disturbances in emotional, behavioral and cognitive arenas, impeding on nearly every aspect of life functioning in the form of thought disorders, delusions and hallucinations. Chronic schizophrenic patients lack pain sensitivity, and have pituitary-adrenal and autonomic nerve dysfunction, abnormalities of the immune system, and water intoxication. These alterations may influence postoperative outcome. Psychotropic drugs often given in combination with each other or with other non-psychiatric drugs generally exert profound effects on the central and peripheral neurotransmitter and ionic mechanisms. The increased complications are associated with physical disorders, antipsychotic or hazardous health behaviour and interactions between antipsychotics and anaesthetic drugs. Adverse responses during anaesthesia include arrhythmias, hypotension, prolonged narcosis or coma, hyperpyrexia, post-operative ileus and post-operative confusion. Although drug interaction probably remains the most potentially serious problem current evidence suggests that psychiatric medication need not be discontinued prior to anesthesia.",

We present a case of metformin-induced psychosis in a 79 years-old patient without any previous psychiatric history. She was brought to emergency room after suicide attempt by hanging. She had a one-month history of altered behavioral and presented paranoid delusional though. Hallucinations were excluded. A detailed clinical evaluation excluded dementia, late-onset chronic psychosis and primary mood disorders with psychotic symptoms and revealed that symptoms initiate few days after the introduction of metformin to treat her diabetes. After Metformin suspension, total remission of psychotic symptoms was obtained in one week and patient return to previous functionality. Psychosis secondary to metformin use is a very rare complication of oral antidiabetic drugs use but the awareness of this condition can lead to an earlier recognition and diagnosis.",

Treatment should begin with a single drug, increasing the dosage gradually until seizures are controlled or adverse effects become unacceptable. If seizures persist, expert clinicians generally try at least one and sometimes a second alternative drug as monotherapy before considering use of two drugs at the same time.",

      "title": "Epilepsy in children and anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy, also called seizure disorder, is the most common childhood brain disorder in the United States. The aetiology of epilepsy in children is multifactorial with congenital, metabolic, infective, and problems associated with prematurity being common causes. Nearly 3 million Americans have epilepsy. About 450,000 of them are under 17 years old. About 1 in 200 children (0.5%) have epilepsy, a neurological condition where children have a predisposition to recurrent, unprovoked seizures. There are many different types of epilepsy, especially in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Epilepsy can be thought of in terms of either: the site of seizure origin in the brain (generalised or focal seizures), or the underlying cause. Genetic epilepsies (formerly called idiopathic or primary epilepsies) occur in an otherwise normal person and are due to a genetic predisposition to seizures. Some epilepsies are due to an underlying abnormality of the brain structure or chemistry (formerly called symptomatic or secondary epilepsies). Other epilepsies have no known cause. Epilepsy is commonly diagnosed in children and can be confused with other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is essential. A seizure is an excessive surge of electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on which parts of the brain are involved. Seizures can be provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures, caused by fever in a young child or severe hypoglycemia, are not considered to be forms of epilepsy. Unprovoked seizures have no clear cause but can be related to genetics or brain injury. When a child has two or more unprovoked seizures, epilepsy is often the diagnosis. Despite advances in antiepileptic medication therapy, a significant number of pediatric patients with epilepsy have seizures that are not well controlled. Antiepileptic medications interact with anesthetic agents, and common anesthetics can precipitate or suppress seizure activity. There are important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between AEDs and drugs commonly used in anaesthesia. These affect both drug efficacy and the risk of seizure activity intraoperatively.",

Risk factors for PD psychosis are advancing age, longer disease duration, severe motor symptoms, presence of dementia, sleep disorders, depression and autonomic dysfunction. Treatment is challenging in this setting because antipsychotic medications are known to worse motor symptoms. Objectives To highlight the therapeutic difficulties in PD-related psychosis. Methods Case description and literature review. Results We report a case of a 74-year-old woman with a 9-year history of PD, who presented a complex psychotic disorder consisting in auditory, olfactory and visual (gulliverian and lilliputian) hallucinations, persecutory and sexual delusions. Additionally, the patient presented euthymic mood, without evidence of cognitive impairment or impulse-control disorder. These symptoms began after dopamine agonist therapy (ropinirole 4 mg/day). Other medical conditions that could justify these symptoms were excluded. Initially, ropinirole was removed, but without psychotic remission. Then, she was treated with antipsychotic medication (clozapine 25 mg/day) with full psychotic remission and without significant worsening of motor symptoms. Conclusions Clozapine treatment is frequently delayed, mainly for fear of its side effects, particularly agranulocytosis. However, this antipsychotic drug presents many benefits regarding the management of PD-related psychosis, namely few motor effects and even improvement of motor fluctuations.

The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia include drooling, difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, difficulty managing secretions, choke/cough episodes while feeding, and food sticking in the throat. If unrecognized and untreated, neurogenic dysphagia can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and respiratory complications. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia may be relatively inapparent on account of both compensation for swallowing impairment and diminution of the laryngeal cough reflex due to a variety of factors. Patients with symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia should undergo videofluoroscopy of swallowing, which in the case of neurogenic dysphagia typically reveals impairment of oropharyngeal motor performance and/or laryngeal protection. The many causes of neurogenic dysphagia include stroke, head trauma, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and myopathy. Evaluation of the cause of unexplained neurogenic dysphagia should include consultation by a neurologist, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, blood tests (routine studies plus muscle enzymes, thyroid screening, vitamin B12 and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and, in certain cases, muscle biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Treatment of neurogenic dysphagia involves treatment of the underlying neurologic disorder (if possible), swallowing therapy (if oral feeding is reasonably safe to attempt) and gastrostomy (if oral feeding is unsafe or inadequate).",

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by complex motor and nonmotor symptoms. The clinical diagnosis of PD is defined by bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, although several nonmotor symptoms are also related to disability, an impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy. Levodopa, which is used as a standard pharmacotherapy for PD, has limitations including a short half‐life, fluctuations in efficacy, and dyskinesias with long‐term use. There have been efforts to develop complementary and alternative therapies for incurable PD. Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional herbal medicine that is widely used for treating neurosis, insomnia, and night crying in children. The clinical efficacy of YKS for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and impaired agitation/aggression subscale and activities of daily living scores, has mainly been investigated in the context of neurological disorders such as PD, Alzheimer’s disease, and other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, YKS has previously been found to improve clinical symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments, pain, and tardive dyskinesia. Preclinical studies have reported that the broad efficacy of YKS for various symptoms involves its regulation of neurotransmitters including GABA, serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine, as well as the expression of dynamin and glutamate transporters, and changes in glucocorticoid hormones and enzymes such as choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, YKS has neuroprotective effects at various cellular levels via diverse mechanisms. In this review, we focus on the clinical efficacy and neuropharmacological effects of YKS. We discuss the possible mechanisms underpinning the effects of YKS on neuropathology and suggest that the multiple actions of YKS may be beneficial as a treatment for PD. We highlight the potential that YKS may serve as a complementary and alternative strategy for the treatment of PD.",

Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs.

      "title": "Subjective Well-being and Initial Dysphoric Reaction under Antipsychotic Drugs - Concepts, Measurement and Clinical Relevance",
      "abstract": "Since the introduction of neuroleptics in 1952, many studies have examined objective aspects of efficacy and tolerability. Despite the fact that neuroleptic treatment should also improve the patient's subjective experiences, this outcome criterion has been neglected in the past. This is unfortunate, as subjective well-being with treatment appears to be strongly related to patients' readiness to take their medication. The few existing studies differ in methodology and are difficult to compare due to a number of weaknesses, including varying underlying concepts, used assessment scales, or small sample sizes. Negative subjective well-being may manifest itself throughout the entire neuroleptic treatment, even as early as in the first 48 hours after neuroleptic treatment starts (initial dysphoric reaction, IDR). The aetiology of reduced subjective well-being or IDR is not fully explained; neuroleptic side effects, especially affective, cognitive and motor adverse events, differential effects of varying psychopathology or biopsychosocial are factors in discussion. The clinical impression is characterised by symptoms as dysphoria/anhedonia, reduced vitality, and emotional indifference, which could have a negative impact on relevant clinical factors such as response or medication adherence, and therefore on outcome. With regard to pharmacological treatment, evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics induce less negative subjective effects than conventional neuroleptics, and that various new-generation antipsychotics could be evaluated differently by patients. This article reviews existing literature in order to approach relevant questions for pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide, opioids remain the mainstay for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. An opioid is any substance with a pharmacological action at the opioid receptor; an opiate is a naturally occurring opioid. Opioid pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic variables vary widely between patients and the therapeutic index is narrow. This necessitates the need for close observation and titration of dose to effect in every patient receiving opioids for acute pain. Nausea and vomiting are predictable and significant side effect of opioids when used to treat opioid-naive patients in acute pain; prophylactic antiemetics are often administered routinely. Traditionally, opioids have been classified as strong, intermediate, and weak, according to their perceived analgesic properties and propensity to addiction. Some opioids have mixed actions because they are also active at other receptors or systems. Nausea and vomiting is a predictable and significant side effect in many patients, especially in acute pain when prophylactic antiemetics are often administered routinely.",

The clozapine side-effects can be subdivided into A) rare but serious side-effects, including agranulocytoses, seizures, cardiovascular complications, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and B) common and more harmless side-effects, including hypersalivation, anticholinergic side-effects such as constipation and urine incontinence, weight gain, and sedation.

Consumption seems to be driven and maintained for desired effects on cognitive or emotional states. ‘Drug use’ in some situations is seen as socially acceptable such as getting a caffeine ‘hit’ from a morning cup of coffee to ‘get going’ or drinking alcohol as part of a social occasion. However, for some individuals and for some substances, drug use risks adverse consequences for brain function and possible enduring harm. This chapter will focus on how brain function may be altered as a consequence of drug use and describe the current understanding of the neurobiology of drugs of abuse and how this may be related to neuropsychiatric consequences. Drugs can produce neuropsychiatric effects acutely during intoxication or withdrawal, and also after chronic exposure, with effects which may or may not be enduring with abstinence.",

Addiction is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking behaviour and consumption, loss of control in limiting consumption and drug dependence typified by withdrawal symptoms when access to the drug is denied. An overviewof the background and our current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin substance abuse and addiction is provided in this chapter. The findings from neurobiological studies suggest that the initial response to addictive substances activate both 'liking' (hedonic) and 'wanting' hotspots in the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum, provoking both the pleasurable effects and the desire to continue taking such agents. People who are dependent on alcohol will display withdrawal symptoms on abrupt cessation of drinking or significant reductions in intake. The withdrawal symptoms include nausea, emesis, tremor, tachycardia, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares and transitory hallucinations.",

Caso clínico: Se presenta el caso de un varón de 42 años con antecedentes personales de trastorno por consumo de sustancias (Heroína, cocaína, alcohol, nicotina y cannabis), con abandono del seguimiento en la unidad de conductas adictivas y múltiples ingresos y asistencias en urgencias por clínica ansioso depresiva y rasgos desadaptativos de personalidad B. Como comorbilidad presenta diabetes mellitus tipo II y EPOC de alto riesgo. En los últimos meses el paciente ha sido atendido múltiples veces en el servicio de urgencias con ajustes varios de tratamiento y con prescripciones de diferentes benzodiazepinas, con patrón de abuso de las mismas, junto con consumo de alcohol, y posterior necesidad de nueva asistencia en el servicio de urgencias por intoxicación o para solicitar medicación de nuevo. Por todo lo anterior se decide ingreso para desintoxicación de benzodiazepinas y alcohol. Conclusiones: Las benzodiazepinas son fármacos muy utilizados en todo el mundo, para diversos trastornos como la ansiedad y el insomnio, con un incremento en su uso en la ultima década. En España, se ha demostrado que hasta en un 82,5 % de los casos se excede la duración del tratamiento, siendo muy frecuente la automedicación y la dependencia. En nuestra práctica clínica, observamos con frecuencia esta problemática en los pacientes hiperfrecuentadores de los servicios de urgencias, en los que se acumulan diferentes tratamientos sin seguimiento adecuado de los mismos, lo que podría fomentar el mal uso de estos fármacos.",

The severity of the symptoms may be, and frequently is, independent of the amount of quinine taken, since persons with sensitivity will show rapid and severe visual loss after swallowing a small amount of quinine in a cold remedy.

      "abstract": "Postoperative delirium (POD) is a disorder of attention and consciousness accompanied by cognitive impairment as a direct consequence of a medical condition, the action (or discontinuation) of a drug, toxin, psychoactive substance or the simultaneous action of several factors. To describe the current state of knowledge on delirium, the Medline PubMed database was searched for full-text articles from the years 2000-2025 using the keywords: \"postoperative delirium,\" \"prediction\" and \"elderly.\" Fifty-six articles were selected for the final analysis. Risk factors for POD are: older age, sensory impairment, alcohol consumption, pre-existing disorders (cognitive, psychomotor activity, sleep-wake rhythm, emotional) and depression. The risk of developing POD can be assessed using questionnaires. Conditions associated with an elevated risk of developing POD include hypertension, history of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases, anaemia, diabetes, renal failure, urinary incontinence and other micturition disorders. The development of perioperative risk assessment questionnaires (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System, Charlson Comorbidity Score) is based on the presence of comorbidities. In addition to conventional analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence has emerged as a novel approach to POD risk factors analysis. Markers of delirium are: inflammatory markers (interleukin 6, neutrophil to limphocyte ratio [NLR] ≥3.5, platelet to lymphocyte ratio [PLR] >139, high CRP concentration), markers of brain tissue damage (D-ribose, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tau protein, S100A12 protein, uric acid), markers of blood-brain barrier damage (urinary albumin, fasting glucose), and many others. The risk of POD can be estimated by ultrasound or computed tomography scan (the cross-sectional diameter of the quadriceps or lumbar muscle) and by electroencephalography. Trigger factors may include major surgery, hypotonia, intraoperative blood transfusion, and the need for intra-aortic counterpulsation. There is no procedure to determine the certain development of delirium. The search for better methods should continue. Recognising the risk of delirium allows earlier preventive measures to be taken and its consequences to be reduced. Med Pr Work Health Saf. 2025;76(3).",

The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder.

Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Although after stroke dysphasia or aphasia is not equal to incapacity, the legal capacity of patients can be doubted. The patients’ ability to fully comprehend the given information and make decisions may be impaired. Stroke is sudden, life threatening and likely to affect capacity even in the absence of dysphasia. There are currently no published guidelines in the management of legal issues for patients and professionals. Method A literature review in the Pubmed database has been made, using the key‐words: stroke, legal capacity, decision‐making Result Brain injury after stroke may impair appreciation of decisions’ consequences and/or communicating decisions effectively, while the capacity to reason remains. Stroke may affect various brain areas, i.e. prefrontal cortex involved in decision‐making (ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage may lead to impulsive decision‐making). A right‐brain stroke may cause poor executive function, lack of initiation or neglect. Left‐hemisphere strokes may lead to aphasia and reduced capacity evaluation. The dysphasic may understand more than he can express, or vice versa. Difficulties further compounding communication problems include: reading and writing; numeracy; inattention/concentration; fatigue; emotional control (lability); perseveration; intellectual functioning. Receptive aphasia can impair understanding medical options, while expressive aphasia may prevent communicating relative decisions. Patients may also be susceptible to undue influence regarding testamentary and financial capacity due to communication deficits and varying levels of dependence. Depression following stroke can further impair capacity. Conclusion The patient may have a communication rather than a capacity deficit. Judging a patient’s ability to weigh information is often the most difficult aspect of legal capacity assessment. There is little literature or high court jurisdiction regarding whether dysphasia after stroke impairs patients’ capacity. Evaluation of the prerequisites for legal capacity requires a multi‐professional cooperation.",

      "abstract": "The term NOMOPHOBIA or NO MObile PHone PhoBIA is used to describe a psychological condition when people have a fear of being detached from mobile phone connectivity. The term NOMOPHOBIA is constructed on definitions described in the DSM-IV, it has been labelled as a “phobia for a particular/specific things”. Various psychological factors are involved when a person overuses the mobile phone, e.g., low self-esteem, extrovert personality. The burden of this problem is now increasing globally. Other mental disorders like, social phobia or social anxiety, and panic disorder may also precipitate NOMOPHOBIC symptoms. It is very difficult to differentiate whether the patient become NOMOPHOBIC due to mobile phone addiction or existing anxiety disorders manifest as NOMOPHOBIC symptoms. The signs and symptoms are observed in NOMOPHOBIA cases include- anxiety, respiratory alterations, trembling, perspiration, agitation, disorientation and tachycardia. NOMOPHOBIA may also act as a proxy to other disorders. So, we have to be very judicious regarding its diagnosis. Some mental disorders can precipitate NOMOPHOBIA also and vice versa. The complexity of this condition is very challenging to the patients’ family members as well as for the physicians as NOMOPHOBIA shares common clinical symptoms with other disorders. That's why NOMOPHOBIA should be diagnosed by exclusion. We have to stay in the real world more than virtual world. We have to re-establish the human-human interactions, face to face connections. So, we need to limit our use of mobile phones rather than banning it because we cannot escape the force of technological advancement.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "title": "Safe use of opioids",
      "abstract": "Background: Opioids are effective analgesics for cancer pain and refractory non-cancer pain. Although they are essential medication, problematic issues on aberrant behavior and adverse events have rapidly emerged as social problems in Korea. This study aimed to describe the mechanisms, efficacy, and adverse events, especially how to deal with opioid dependency.Current Concepts: Opioid-induced aberrant behavior includes physical and psychological dependences (addiction), abuse, and diversion (giving prescribed opioids to another person). Most physicians are unfamiliar with how to handle patients presenting these problematic issues. Physical and psychological dependences develop through different pathophysiologic mechanisms, i.e., noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways, respectively. Motivational enhancement therapy, psychosocial support, substitution therapy with buprenorphine, and adjunctive medications, including alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, antidepressants, and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, are the mainstay of treatment for opioid dependency. Constipation, nausea/vomiting, drowsiness/sedation, delirium, itching sensation, voiding difficulty, dry mouth, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and respiratory depression are well-known physical side effects of opioid consumption.Discussion and Conclusion: Research on the development history, epidemiology of opioid dependency, and its treatment are warranted to avoid an opioid crisis in Korea. Above all, thorough knowledge for physicians and patients is urgently needed.",

One of the reasons for this is that renal and liver functions are often impaired in elderly people. Dementia and delirium (an acute confused state) are known to be associated with drug toxicity. Anticholinergic medications are common causes of both acute and chronic cognitive impairment. Psychoactive drugs, antidepressants and anticonvulsants can cause dementia and delirium. In addition, non-psychoactive drugs such as histamine H2 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent), and cardiac medications, may cause acute or chronic cognitive impairment. Early diagnosis and withdrawal of the offending agent are essential for the prevention of drug-induced dementia and delirium.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoids are the most commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant medications worldwide. This article highlights the risk of clinically significant and sometimes severe psychological, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances that may be associated with glucocorticoid use, as well as ways to prevent and treat these disturbances. An illustrative case vignette is presented describing a patient’s experience of cycles of manic-like behavior and depression while on high-dosage prednisone, with long-term cognitive disorganization, vulnerability to stress, and personality changes. Severe neuropsychiatric consequences (including suicide, suicide attempt, psychosis, mania, depression, panic disorder, and delirium, confusion, or disorientation) have been reported to occur in 15.7 per 100 person-years at risk for all glucocorticoid courses, and 22.2 per 100 person-years at risk for first courses. The majority of patients experience less severe but distressing and possibly persistent changes in mood, cognition, memory, or behavior during glucocorticoid treatment or withdrawal. Although prediction of such effects is difficult, risks vary with age, gender, dosage, prior psychiatric history, and several biological markers. Key mechanisms thought to underlie these risk factors are briefly described. Recommendations are given for identifying individual risk factors and for monitoring and managing adverse neuropsychiatric effects of glucocorticoids.",

      "abstract": "Despite an initial sedative effect, alcohol disrupts sleep persistently and should not be used as a sleeping aid. Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

      "title": "Opiophobia: A Barrier to Pain Management",
      "abstract": "Opiophobia is the physicians’ irrational fear of prescribing opioids for patients with severe pain. It’s one of the major reasons for many patients to not receive adequate analgesia (oligoanalgesia). It’s an old phenomenon that still persists in both developed and developing countries with diff erent rates. This is an unsystematic literature review of studies that have been written about opiophobia since 1960 using Google Scholar, PubMed and EBSCO to search for the following terms: opiophobia, oligoanalgesia and necrophobia. Studies included were review articles and surveys studies. We found that the three main reasons for opiophobia are concern over addiction, concern over serious side eff ects (mainly respiratory depression) and concern over legal consequences. These consequences, such as being sued, result from serious side eff ects masking or delaying the diagnosis. Lack of knowledge about pain management was another factor among young physicians and interns. As a result, many patients are not adequately treated for severe pain. Physicians prescribe lesser dosages than required and nurses administer even lesser dosages than the physicians prescribed. To tackle such problems, it’s important to know the causes. Education, clarifi cation of the myths and increasingthe physicians’ and nurses’ awareness about pain management is a critically important step especially for new physicians and interns.",

      "title": "Seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome",
      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome develops in individuals with alcohol dependence who discontinue or reduce alcohol intake after long-term or binge drinking. Withdrawal symptoms usually occur 6–8 hours after the last alcohol consumption and peak between 24–72 hours. Typical manifestations include tremor, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, and excess sweating. Complicated withdrawal syndrome may manifest with seizures (including cluster seizures), status epilepticus, acute psychosis and delirium, when hallucinations are accompanied by disorientation in time, place and situation. About 10–15% of patients develop complicated withdrawal syndrome. The seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome are triggered in the brain stem and have a mechanism other than that of classic epileptic seizures. Benzodiazepines, which are more effective than other classes of anticonvulsants (they primarily reduce the frequency of convulsions in the first two days after alcohol discontinuation and significantly reduce the risk of death), are the gold standard for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) is a helpful tool for making decisions on treatment initiation or discontinuation. It should be noted that chronic use of benzodiazepines in the secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures is not recommended due to the addictive potential of these agents and a more severe course of alcohol withdrawal seizures with benzodiazepine co-dependence.",

      "abstract": "Treating an opioid overdose using an opioid receptor antagonist (such as naloxone) makes mechanistic sense and can be effective. Unfortunately, the majority of current drug overdose deaths involve polysubstance use (i.e., an opioid plus a non-opioid).Respiratory depression induced by opioids results from excessive opioid molecules binding to opioid receptors. This effect can be reversed by an opioid receptor antagonist. However, the respiratory depression induced by non-opioid drugs is not due to action at opioid receptors; thus, an opioid receptor antagonist is ineffective in many of these cases. For respiratory depression induced by non-opioids, receptor antagonists are either not available (e.g., for propofol overdose) or there may be attendant risks with their use (e.g., seizures with flumazenil). This gives rise to a need for more effective ways to treat polysubstance overdose.A new approach to treating opioid-induced respiratory depression due to drug overdose focuses on agents that stimulate respiratory drive rather than competing for opioid receptors. Such an approach is \"agnostic\" to the cause of the respiratory depression, so might be a potential way to treat polysubstance overdose.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of sleep belong to the most frequent troubles. A lot of different factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of sleep disorders. Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

Patients with physical injury requiring rehabilitation may be at particular risk of AODA due to pain, physical handicaps, mood disturbances, vocational difficulties, and problems of self-image. Their access to AODA, however, is often temporarily or permanently limited. In this literature review, we have explored various aspects of AODA in physically disabled patients. Frequently, AODA are involved in the cause of physical injuries. The average use and abuse of alcohol prior to injury was high. Postinjury alcohol use and abuse frequently declined or remained unchanged. Some non-alcohol drug use and problems increased postinjury, particularly during initial periods. Postinjury abuse of AODA is particularly important with regard to the disruption of the rehabilitation process. Use of adequate control groups and analysis at multiple postinjury time points is recommended in future investigations.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a rarely diagnosed disorder characterized by continuous sensory disturbances following the use of hallucinogenic substances. Its cause remains unknown, and treatments remain elusive, although previous case reports have detailed attempts at treatment with a variety of psychoactive medications. No previous case reports have discussed the emergence of HPPD following dextromethorphan use, or its treatment with ropinirole. Case: We present the case of a 20-year-old male who developed HPPD after repeated recreational dextromethorphan use at supratherapeutic dosages, leading to the acute onset of visual snow, motional trails, the persistence of afterimages, the perception of halos around lights, tinnitus, and depersonalization and derealization. The client found these symptoms to be greatly distressing, and he had worsening of symptoms when treated with antipsychotic medications. After he was treated with lamotrigine and clonazepam, he had some improvement of symptoms. To treat additional visual symptoms, the patient was given ropinirole, a dopamine agonist, which made him feel better with less visual disturbances. Ultimately he had to discontinue all medications due to intolerability to side effects. Conclusions: The lack of effective treatments for HPPD and a general lack of awareness among patients and providers leads to underdiagnosis and incorrect management. Ropinirole may offer a novel treatment for patients with HPPD, and more research is needed to determine the suitability of dopamine agonists in the treatment for HPPD.",

      "abstract": "In patients with consequences of a stroke, disturbances in motor, cognitive, and sensory functions are observed; cardiovascular, endocrine and other body systems, impairment of self-care and independent walking. Physical dependence, the inability to self-care in fulfilling urgent biological needs leads to a feeling of helplessness and is accompanied by depressive, neurotic reactions to the disease. Restoration of impaired functions after a stroke has a long period and the success of recovery depends, on the one hand, on the volume and location of the brain lesion, the severity of motor and cognitive impairments, on the other hand, on the position of the patient himself, the attitude of the patient’s personality to the disease and adherence to treatment. A patient’s stay in a hospital is associated with the social expectations of the staff for certain behavior of the patient: fulfilling the instructions of the attending physician, partnership with staff (physical therapy methodologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, etc.), the patient’s activity, the formation of healthy lifestyle attitudes (giving up smoking, alcohol, fatty food, etc.), which can be called psychological conditions for rehabilitation. However, not all patients are ready to fulfill these rehabilitation conditions, which are targets for psychological correction. The tasks of psychological assistance should be focused on developing adherence to treatment, forming cooperative relationships with staff, and healthy lifestyle attitudes, which can contribute to restorative treatment and the prevention of recurrent stroke. Psychological assistance during individual and group work should be focused on providing emotional support, setting realistic and understandable goals for the patient, adequate to the patient’s capabilities, both in a hospital and clinic, which can ensure his active inclusion in the treatment process.",

In known epileptics, irregular use (non-compliance) of the drugs prescribed--or an infection (GI tract infection with disordered absorption) may be the triggering factor. Attention is drawn to the importance of the determination of serum levels (of anti-epileptic drugs). The establishment of day profiles in known epileptics can reveal inadequate or irregular ingestion of prescribed drugs to be the causal factor.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between suicidality and substance abuse has long been recognized, although studies have only fairly recently begun to identify factors that may help clarify how alcohol or other drug abuse increases the susceptibility to suicidal behavior in vulnerable populations. In particular, alcohol and other psychoactive substance misuse has been linked with mood destabilization and the induction of manic or depressive episodes in affectively ill individuals, while also demarcating groups with heightened tendencies toward impulsivity, aggression, and sensitivity to interpersonal loss. Serotonergic mechanisms have been implicated in each of these clinical settings, along with possible dysregulation of other neurotransmitter systems. Psychosocial aspects of alcohol or drug abuse relevant to suicide may involve a heightened sensitivity to interpersonal loss, poor coping skills in response to adverse life events, and affective dysregulation induced by circadian and psychosocial stresses. Consequently, self-destructive behaviors with relatively little premeditation may arise during periods of increased stress, intoxication, depression, or other psychopathology. Early detection of substance abuse followed by appropriate pharmacologic and/or psychotherapeutic interventions may greatly help to minimize the formation of complex comorbid psychiatric conditions and reduce the potential for suicidal acts among high-risk populations.",

      "title": "[Cognitive and behavioral consequences of epilepsy during the course of brain development].",
      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

Typically, in an oculogyric crisis the patient's awareness is intact; accompanied signs can be blepharospasm, neck flexion, jaw opening with or without tongue protrusion and autonomic symptoms. The underlying pathophysiology seems an imbalance between cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways. Most frequently an oculogyric crisis is caused by antidopaminergic medications, for example neuroleptics and metoclopramide. Treatment of medication-induced oculogyric crisis with parenteral anticholinergics typically leads to a fast remission of symptoms.

      "abstract": "Opioid use disorder has risen to epidemic proportions in the United States at an alarming rate in the past decade and is considered a leading public health concern. Women have a higher rate of acute and chronic pain conditions and are more likely to be prescribed opioids for pain management. The disproportionate incidence of opioid use, misuse, and progression to heroin and injectable drug use among reproductive age women is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Of particular concern are the unique health risks opioid-dependent women face including immune system alterations, endocrinopathies, diminished fertility, psychosocial isolation, interpersonal violence, and unintentional overdose. Opioid use in pregnancy is associated with negative maternal and neonatal consequences and requires comprehensive, multidisciplinary services for the co-occurring medical, mental health, infectious disease, social stressors, and legal issues. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is linked to a cluster of physiological withdrawal symptoms and considered the primary adverse outcome of opioid exposure in newborns. Maternal medication-assisted treatment with methadone or buprenorphine to decrease the negative effects of neonatal withdrawal is the standard of care for opioid use disorders in pregnancy. The complexity of services required for maternal opioid use disorders requires collaborative and multidisciplinary management strategies to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes.",

A technique of nitrous oxide administration beyond the state of intoxication and avoiding the Stage of deep hypoxemia has been described. 3. Physiological changes with this form of anæsthesia are slight and the method may be considered safe. 4. After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9. The theories on the pharmacological action of nitrous oxide and the reason for its choice are discussed.",

Factors such as substance use or withdrawal, related psychosocial stressors, and co-occurring somatic health problems complicate the diagnostic process. Addressing psychiatric symptoms is essential to optimizing treatment of substance use disorders. Medications can help but may be unnecessary once substance use is stabilized. Other approaches include counseling, psychotherapy, case coordination, and inpatient or residential care. There are additional issues that arise with specific psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders (depression and bipolar), anxiety and trauma-related disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), psychotic disorders, personality disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

The signs appeared within 2 days in almost half of the patients, and remitted in most within 2-3 days. Predisposing factors, of which more than one may be present, are advanced age, hepatic or renal dysfunction, or severe underlying disease. The 3 cases described were all old, one had cirrhosis with bleeding oesophageal varices, and one had renal failure with nephrotic syndrome and amyloidosis. In view of the increasingly wide use of cimetidine, conditions in which there is decreased metabolic breakdown, or excretion, or predisposition to increased brain levels should prompt careful follow-up, and possibly a lower dosage regimen, especially in elderly patients.",

      "abstract": "The use of opioid medications for analgesia is associated with concerns about adverse side effects and the potential for development of physical dependence, tolerance, or addiction. Pain often is undertreated, which may provoke drug-seeking behavior by patients. Physicians must assess requests for more pain medication as stemming from either undertreatment of pain, development of physical tolerance, or addiction. Important tools for addiction screening include the use of questionnaires, patient interviews, and lab tests. In this study, the physiological and behavioral consequences of chronic pain and its treatment with opioids, along with guidelines for prescribing opioid pain medication, are presented.",

      "abstract": "The selection of an antiepileptic drug (AED) for initial treatment of epilepsy in infancy, childhood, and adolescence should ideally be made after a clear syndromic diagnosis of the patient's seizure disorder. A common cause of failure of the first AED is erroneous diagnosis. The availability of new-generation AEDs has expanded the choice of available agents with comparable efficacy for most syndromes. Efficacy data based on class I or II evidence are not available for many syndromes of childhood, and selection must therefore be based on the best data available. It is also important to assess the relative toxicity and tolerability of AEDs in making the selection. It is especially important to appreciate age-specific organ toxicities. Moreover, the use of AEDs in childhood requires an understanding of their neurobehavioral effects. Important neuropsychiatric co-morbidities in children with epilepsy include attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autistic spectrum disorders, depression and anxiety, and thought disorders. These problems can be exacerbated or ameliorated by specific AEDs. The effect of AEDs on body weight, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and bone health is becoming better appreciated. Newer AEDs may offer significant advantages in this regard. Co-morbid migraine in children with epilepsy may benefit from some AEDs. There remains a continuing need for the development of newer AEDs that are targeted for the developing brain to improve the efficacy and tolerability of treatment in childhood seizure disorders.",

It is a fairly common problem in paediatric age: approximately 1 child out of 5 is affected at 5 years of age, with a potential significant impact on their quality of life and family. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

Delirium is an acute mental status change that is characterized by a disorder of attention and cognitive function that is typically a consequence of a medical condition. Despite differences in terminology, there are many other reasons that delirium is insufficiently diagnosed, and this is more pronounced in older adults. Coexisting dementia combined with lack of understanding of baseline mental status by healthcare providers may lead to assumptions that symptoms related to delirium are normal. Delirium is commonly missed in clinical practice, and so familiarity of the key features is extremely important. Patients with delirium may have lethargy or decreased arousal, while others may be hyperalert or hypervigilant. Medications are a leading cause of delirium, especially in older adults. Older patients are often on multiple medications and are typically more at risk for adverse effects from medications.",

Regardless of sensory modality, disorders of the special senses in the elderly can be conveniently divided into conductive, sensorineural, and central disorders. Disorders of the chemosensory senses, smell and taste, are usually less disabling than disorders of the other special senses (vision and hearing). Nevertheless, olfactory impairment is a significant contributor to perceived disability and lower quality of life among elderly patients and is a significant predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Gustatory disorders in the elderly that are not secondary to olfactory disorders should prompt consideration of systemic factors, such as medication use, toxin exposures and autoimmune disorders.",

Chronic insomnia disorder is not an indication. The gold standard treatment for this disorder is cognitive and behavioral therapy. The prescription of a hypnotic should not be trivialized and is part of a short-term strategy. In the long term, hypnotics have poor effect on sleep duration, have side effects (excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired memory or attention, risk of falls and accidents), and have a high risk of dependence. The modalities of discontinuation of hypnotic treatments are to be anticipated with the patient as soon as the prescription is initiated. The discontinuation will be done by a gradual decrease of the doses to avoid a rebound effect at the end of the 4 weeks of prescriptions. In the context of chronic consumption of hypnotics, a strategy of discontinuation has to be proposed at any request for renewal of hypnotics. The decision must be discussed and considered with the patient during a shared decision-making process. Implementation requires precise evaluation of the severity of insomnia, the presence of a hypnotic dependence and the presence of a comorbid psychiatric disorder.Prise en charge de l’insomnie : approche médicamenteuse La prescription d’un hypnotique est envisageable dans l’insomnie aiguë transitoire, mais seulement sur une courte période et dans cette seule indication. Le trouble d’insomnie chronique n’est pas une indication et le traitement de référence dans ce cadre est la thérapie cognitive et comportementale. La prescription d’un hypnotique ne doit pas être banalisée et s’inscrit dans une stratégie à court terme.

Les modalités d’arrêt des traitements hypnotiques sont à anticiper avec le patient dès la prescription initiale. L’arrêt se fera par une diminution progressive des doses pour éviter un effet rebond à la fin des 4 semaines de prescription. Dans le cadre d’une consommation chronique d’hypnotiques, une stratégie d’arrêt est à proposer devant toute demande de renouvellement d’hypnotiques. L’arrêt doit être discuté et envisagé avec le patient au cours d’un processus de décision partagée.

Ces stimulus étaient l'apomorphine, l'émétine, la scoline et le choc électrique. Rien n'indique à l'évidence que ces méthodes sont plus efficaces que les autres, non excitantes, pour traiter les alcooliques. L'échec de ces méthodes est parfois attribuable à des modes de conditionnement défectueux. Ainsi, (1) la difficulté qu'on éprouve à régler l'intervalle entre la présentation du stimulus conditionné (SC) (alcool) et la survenance du réflexe non conditionné (RNC) (nausée et vomissements). L'intervalle critique (de 0 à 5 secondes) entre le SC et le RNC est d'une extrême importance dans le conditionnement classique; (2) L'effet hypnotique souvent produit par les drogues productrices de nausées, qui peut rendre difficile le processus du conditionnement. Cependant, même lorsqu'un réflexe de répugnance à l'alcool est bien conditionné, il peut ne pas suffire à produire des modifications du comportement chez le buveur. Rien non plus ne vient prouver l'efficacité thérapeutique particulière du LSD.L'auteur met en lumière la difficulté d'évaluation de la plupart des études passées en revue et il expose les conditions minimales qui président à des études bien faites.

      "title": "Pathways to schizophrenia: the impact of environmental factors",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is an aetiologically complex disorder arising from the interaction of a range of factors acting at various stages of life. Schizophrenic individuals inherit genes that cause structural brain deviations which may be compounded by early environmental insults. As a result some pre-schizophrenic children exhibit subtle developmental delays, cognitive problems, or poor interpersonal relationships. They are susceptible to dysregulation of dopamine, the final pathway leading to the onset of a psychotic illness. Dopamine dysregulation may arise through a process of sensitization, which, in animals, can be caused by repeated administration of dopamine-releasing drugs. It is clear that the same process occurs in humans, and that some individuals are particularly sensitive to the effects of such drugs for either genetic reasons or through early environmental damage. Stress has also been shown to induce dopamine release in animal studies, and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that social stresses can precipitate schizophrenia. Thus, stresses, such as drug use and social adversity, in adolescence or early adult life may propel the neurodevelopmentally impaired individual over a threshold into frank psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

It is part of borderline personality disorder (a disorder characterized by emotional lability and ill‐considered, self‐harming acts); antisocial personality disorder (characterized by rash, ill‐thought out acts that often harm others); attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (characterized by difficulty waiting one's turn and persevering on tasks); bulimia nervosa (characterized by binge eating and subsequent purging); alcohol and drug‐use disorders; and a whole set of impulse‐control disorders, such as kleptomania, pyromania, and intermittent explosive disorder.

      "abstract": "Terminal decline (or terminal cognitive decline) is the gradual decline in cognitive function that occurs as a function of time before death. The onset and severity of terminal decline vary greatly between individuals. It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medical treatment of the addictions remains controversial, with addiction itself viewed as a lifestyle problem, a hijacking of brain systems by drugs, or as a medical illness. Many of these controversies may be avoided by taking a goal-oriented approach to treatment, in which clinical objectives are defined, and both medications and psychological interventions are used to facilitate progress towards these. The effectiveness of medications is maximized when they are used as one component of a comprehensive treatment plan. There are no ‘magic bullets’ in addiction treatment—the same pharmacological principles apply to these drug treatments as to any other. Drugs need to be given in effective doses, at appropriate intervals, allowed time to reach steady state, and also to dissipate when terminated on the basis of their half-life. Some drugs also have an abuse potential of their own (e.g. opiates, sedative-hypnotics) especially those with a rapid onset of action, and such drugs need to be particularly closely monitored and controlled, to minimize their diversion and misuse.",

No major changes in the neurological status of these children were observed. However, the three children with ADHD showed an exacerbation of symptoms on fluoxetine. Discontinuation (n = 5) or halving the dosage (n = 7) resulted in complete resolution of these unwanted symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks. In all 7 children whose doses were reduced, improvement of the depressive or obsessive compulsive symptoms was maintained on the lower dosage. Clinicians treating children with fluoxetine are cautioned to be aware of behavioral side effects which may be alleviated by dosage reduction or possibly by starting with lower doses. These side effects may be difficult to differentiate from common psychopathological symptoms such as hyperactivity, restlessness, and impulsivity.",

The majority of patients, particularly those with young onset of PD, experience these levodopa-related adverse effects after a few years of treatment. Assessment of these motor complications is difficult because of the marked clinical variability between and within patients. Daily diaries have been used in clinical trials designed to assess the effects of various pharmacological and surgical interventions on motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. The most common type of dyskinesia, called \"peak-dose dyskinesia\", usually consists of stereotypical choreic or ballistic movements involving the head, trunk, and limbs, and occasionally, the respiratory muscles, whereas tremor and punding are less-common complications. Dystonia is also typically seen in patients with diphasic dyskinesia and wearing-off effect. Recognition of the full spectrum of clinical phenomenology of levodopa-related motor complications is essential for their treatment and prevention. © 2005 Movement Disorder Society",

In an era of increasing incidence and survival of patients with single or multiple organ failure, knowledge on both multiorgan crosstalk and the physiopathological consequences of extracorporeal organ support have become increasingly important. Immerse within the cross-talk of multiple organ failure (MOF), Acute kidney injury (AKI) may be a part of the clinical presentation in patients undergoing ECOS, either as a concurrent clinical issue since the very start of ECOS or as a de novo event at any point in the clinical course. At any point during the clinical course of a patient with single or multiple organ failure undergoing ECOS, renal function may improve or deteriorate, as a result of the interaction of multiple factors, including multiorgan crosstalk and physiological consequences of ECOS. Common physiopathological ways in which ECOS may influence renal function includes: 1) multiorgan crosstalk (preexisting or de-novo 2)Hemodynamic changes and 3) ECOS-associated coagulation abnormalities and 3) Also, cytokine profile switch, neurohumoral changes and toxins clearance may contribute to the expected physiological changes related to ECOS.

      "abstract": "The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) becomes increasingly attractive not only for neurobiologists, psychologists and psychiatrists, but also for sociologists and economists promoted by the discovery of amazing behavioural functions it regulates, especially in the context of social interactions. The discovery of multiple pro-social as well as anti-stress effects of OT, which have been discovered in recent years, makes the OT system of the brain a promising target for psychotherapeutic intervention and treatment of numerous psychiatric illnesses, for example, anxiety disorders, social phobia, depression or autism (Slattery & Neumann, 2010). The endogenous OT system of the brain can be found in different activity forms. Consequently, neuronal OT synthesis, OT release within distinct regions of the brain, OT receptor binding and the intensity of OT behavioural effects can vary in dependence on the physiological (or pathophysiological) activity state, which will be outlined in more detail below. It is generally assumed that psychopathologies associated with impaired social interactions, such as autism, are accompanied by an impaired activity of the brain OT system, which may affect at least one of the above mentioned parameters.",

      "title": "[Delayed endolymphatic hydrops].",
      "abstract": "Delayed Endolymphatic Hydrops (DEH) is a disease entity that must be distinguished from idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops (Ménière's disease). Idiopathic hydrops is characterized by the following symptoms: 1) vertigo often accompanied by nausea and vomiting; 2) tinnitus; 3) hearing loss, usually fluctuating; and 4) sensation of pressure or fullness in the affected ear. Idiopathic hydrops most commonly occurs in middle-aged patients, usually between 30 and 50 years. It may involve one or both ears and usually exibits fluctuating hearing loss and episodic vertigo, although one symptom may precede the other by months or years. It is rare for Ménière's disease to present with a severe sensorineural hearing loss. Delayed Endolymphatic Hydrops was first described, under the name of \"unilateral deafness with subsequent vertigo\", by Wolfson and Lieberman and Nadol et al.; this was later confirmed by other authors. The disease is characterized by a profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear, found to have been present in most cases from early childhood, due to an unknown cause, trauma or viral infections. After a prolonged period (usually many years) patients with DEH experience the onset of episodic vertigo from the deaf ear (Ipsilateral Delayed Endolymphatic Hydrops) or develop a fluctuating hearing loss and/or episodic vertigo in the opposite ear, previously with normal hearing (Controlateral Delayed Endolymphatic Hydrops). Vestibular symptoms are identical to those of Ménière's disease: in fact there is evidence that endolymphatic hydrops in the previously damaged ear or in the previously normal ear represents at least part of the labyrinthine pathology. Histopathology studies recently conducted on temporal bones of subjects affected with controlateral DEH show pathologic changes in the deaf ears similar to those found in viral labyrinthitis, whereas pathologic changes in the hearing ears resemble those known to occur in Ménière's disease. Medical treatment has not been found to be effective in patients with DEH, but it must be the first choice of treatment especially in controlateral forms of the disease. So far, surgical intervention has been demonstrated to give the best results; either conservative or more radical, depending on the type of DEH. Pharmacological labyrinthectomy with ototoxic drugs could be the therapy of choice in the future. In this paper we review the literature in order to summarize the clinical features and criteria for diagnosing DEH, we also report histopathologic findings and pathogenetic hypotheses formulated for this syndrome. Moreover, we discuss the best therapeutic approach for the ipsilateral and controlateral variants of DEH.",

      "abstract": "Mortality rate is high in psychiatric patients versus general population. An important cause of this increased mortality is sudden cardiac death (SCD) as a major side-effect of psychotropic drugs. These SCDs generally result from arrhythmias occurring when the posology is high and may attain a toxic threshold but also at dosages within therapeutic range, in the presence of risk factors. There are three kinds of risk factors: physiological (e.g., low cardiac rate of sportsmen), physiopathological (e.g., hepatic insufficiency, hypothyroidism) and \"therapeutic\" (due to interactions between psychotropic drugs and other medicines). Association of pharmacological agents may increase the likelihood of SCDs either by (i) a pharmacokinetic mechanism (e.g., increased torsadogenic potential of a psychotropic drug when its destruction and/or elimination are compromised) or (ii) a pharmacodynamical mechanism (e.g., mutual potentiation of proarrhythmic properties of two drugs). In addition, some psychotropic drugs may induce sudden death in cases of pre-existing congenital cardiopathies such as (i) congenital long QT syndrome, predisposing to torsade de pointes that eventually cause syncope and sudden death. (ii) A Brugada syndrome, that may directly cause ventricular fibrillation due to reduced sodium current through Nav1.5 channels. Moreover, psychotropic drugs may be a direct cause of cardiac lesions also leading to SCD. This is the case, for example, of phenothiazines responsible for ischemic coronaropathies and of clozapine that is involved in the occurrence of myocarditis. The aims of this work are to delineate: (i) the risk of SCD related to the use of psychotropic drugs; (ii) mechanisms involved in the occurrence of such SCD; (iii) preventive actions of psychotropic drugs side effects, on the basis of the knowledge of patient-specific risk factors, documented from clinical history, ionic balance, and ECG investigation by the psychiatrist.",

These agents pass through the human placenta and may affect the developing embryo and fetus. Indeed, large amounts of alcohol ingested by the pregnant woman may produce a specific syndrome manifested by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, a variety of facial dysmorphic features and mental retardation. Ingestion of smaller amounts of alcohol will produce the fetal alcohol effects with only few and minor dysmorphic features but with developmental delay and some degree of intellectual impairment. Cocaine use during pregnancy may apparently result in an increase in the rate of congenital anomalies, of stillbirth and of intrauterine growth retardation. The use of heroin and opiates does not seem to increase the rate of major congenital anomalies, but it reduces fetal growth and increases the rate of intrauterine fetal death. Studies on the developmental outcome of children born to cocaine or heroin dependent mothers seem all to show psychomotor developmental delay at a young age. At school age these children have intellectual impairment and a very high rate of inattention and/or hyperactivity. We should therefore address our efforts in improving the environment of these children and in treating the early symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, even before the child reaches school.",

      "abstract": "The restricted neurogenesis limits the brain ability to overcome neuronal cell death following ischemic lesion: Failure of the damaged brain to regenerate following cerebral ischemia results in functional deficits those are most often irreversible and can further deteriorate, causing mortality and severe disability, progressive memory loss and cognitive impairments, known as dementia. This is caused by massive neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity following limited blood supply to the brain. Ischemic death of brain neurons (acute or delayed after lesion) has been the etiology of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Multiple types of vascular dementia exist, common in cognitive decline that gradually worsens and variable in where strokes happen (subcortical dementia) or how severe lesions are (e.g., major stroke, series of small strokes or brief transient ischemic attacks). It has emerged a synergistic combination of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease that often comes (mixed dementia). For over the last three decades after the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death had been discovered, intense research has been focused on withdrawing or, at least, attenuating neurodegeneration to improve restoring function in experimental models of post-stroke cognitive impairments while mimicking focal ischemia, permanent or transient brain lesions, hypertension or reproducing Alzheimer's disease combined with vascular pathology [for review (Hainsworth et al., 2017)]. Long-standing perspectives that ischemic neuronal death might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection stay with genomic reprogramming and/or gene activation for de novo protein synthesis, relied on the hypoxia-activated signaling pathways (Dirnagl et al., 2009). On the other hands, pre-clinical studies, including our own works (Kopach et al., 2016; Rybachuk et al., 2017), have reported functional impairments at the later times (weeks) post-ischemia (as in principal neurons as within network), with controversial effectiveness of pharmacological therapeutics utilized after lesion. Unfulfilled regeneration convinces experimental neuroscientists to focus on cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies used to overcome massive neuronal loss in the brain tissue subjected to ischemia. The major issue, however, remains how this therapy should be utilized in order to promote beneficial effects timely, namely via engraftment of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) or already differentiated stem cell-derived neurons into the damaged brain. From that, the other conceptual question arises regarding the regulatory role of a host environment in either NSPC neurogenesis or functional integration of the grafted stem cell-derived cells. If choose the latter, what 'proper' proportion of the entirely different phenotypes needs to be grafted to possibly succeed? More insights into this are essential when considering cell therapy while aiming at remodeling of the damaged post-stroke brain from mixed stem cell-derived cells for restoring the broken functionality of such a complex tissue as the brain. NSPC grafts mature neuronal phenotype within a host tissue in a weeks' time: The survival rate of differentiated stem cell-derived cells grafted into the organized brain tissue has been routinely low – this suggests a strong regulatory role of the host environment in the viability of stem cells. As an alternative, grafting NSPCs could potentially promote the multipotent stem cell differentiation and subsequent maturation of the entirely different phenotypes, regulated by endogenous environment, to pave the way towards 'self-repair' of damaged tissue while engaging the endogenous mechanisms of self-renewal. However, discoveries in this field are hampered by technical challenges and controversy in clinically translatable advances. Eventually, the enormous potential of stem cell therapy has been evidenced for post-stroke recovery (Tornero et al., 2017) while its neurophysiological basis has been much less learned thus far. Repeatedly reported common patterns of firing and synaptic activity have been recorded from the stem cell-derived neurons at the very end time-points – typically few months after transplantation – that fosters underestimation of the time-dependent neurophysiological integration of differentiated cells into the host tissue. In our recent study, we have traced the time courses of maturation and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, demonstrating their matured excitability and synaptogenesis (to the level of endogenous principal neurons – CA1 pyramidal neurons) within 3 weeks or less in situ (Kopach et al., 2018). To neurophysiological point of view, biophysical properties (Na+/K+ conductance, capability for high-frequency firing, characteristic excitatory transmission) make these cells physiologically credible those are capable to constitute specified relationships with other cells, providing functional impact. This also points out the accelerated rate of neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts in situ when compared with much longer time required to achieve similar patterns of activity by stem cell-derived neurons in vitro (Morgan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Telezhkin et al., 2016). For restorative neuroscience, a query remains to precisely define the timing of NSPC-derived phenotypes mature and set the appropriate activity within the damaged, pathophysiological environment. Establishing this is primary to enabling the assessment of timing for emerging beneficial effects, to design and rationale further reaching perspectives for accelerating stem cell neurogenesis while considering replacement strategies for various post-stroke brain regions (subpopulations of neurons, other neural cell types). Post-ischemic environment regulates neurogenesis of NSPC grafts: An in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia provides technological advantages for feasibly exploring the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death together with managing therapeutic approaches for targeted interventions in the organized brain tissue. In translational neuroscience, this methodology benefits with a meaningful consideration of variable experimental modifications utilized to mimic ischemic insult and onset of cell therapy (depending on how severe and complex the ischemic impairments are, diverse stem cell origin, etc.). In our study of an in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia optimized for a delayed death of principal neurons [within 2 weeks instead of acute CA1 neuronal death (Rybachuk et al., 2017)], we have traced the functional properties of NSPC grafts over the time in the hippocampal tissue subjected to ischemia (Figure 1; Kopach et al., 2018). The post-ischemic environment influenced neurogenesis of NSPC grafts in different ways. Neuronal maturation has been delayed, both excitability and synaptogenesis, at each time points tested (for over 3 weeks in total; Figure 1). Instead, multipotent NSPC differentiation has been prompted towards the non-neuronal phenotype – we have identified the NSPC-derived glial cells as fast as within a week in the post-ischemic tissue. Such principal difference in the stem cell fate between control and post-ischemic environments implies the determinant, yet underestimated, regulatory role of the host tissue in neurogenesis of NSPCs, both differentiation profile (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) and neurophysiological maturation.Figure 1: The experimental scheme of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) administration in an in situ model of stroke.A carton shows the time course for functional assessment of the NSPC-derived neural maturation in a host tissue (organotypic hippocampal tissue subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation of 10 minutes duration, with onset of the therapy after 2 hours (h) of re-oxygenation). W: Week(s).Endogenous facilitators of stem cell fate: Ischemic cell damage results in the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity followed by massive neuronal death and overwhelmed neurotoxicity. Ultimately, different signaling molecules and mediators are released those levels became dramatically heightened, overloading the extracellular matrix and activating a vast majority of signaling pathways, with an immense variety of molecular mechanisms being involved. Moreover, during neuronal cell death, necrotic, pro-apoptotic factors and mediators of inflammation activate pro-inflammatory signaling, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and others, pertinent to overactivated astrocytic response featuring the post-ischemic brain. Numerous signaling cascades can, thus, contribute to how the ischemia-subjected environment governs the fate of NSPC grafts. The notable regulatory roles in stem cell differentiation have been evidenced for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), Ca2+-dependent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and Wnt signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies, among the involved cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMK pathways, and phospholipase C and D signaling activation (Le Belle et al., 2011; Telezhkin et al., 2016). Therefore, pharmacological or genetic manipulations modulating presently dissecting signaling pathways, providing multiple growth facilitators, such as neurotrophins, to support intrinsic growth capacity of differentiating neurons, neutralizing high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the post-ischemic tissue can accelerate neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts. Further, the supposed beneficial effects may include neurogenesis of the resident neural stem cells of the brain for activating endogenous self-renewal. By contrast, the non-neural (glial) NSPC differentiation, prompted up in the post-ischemic tissue, assumes the ROS-mediated regulation of NSPCs. The activated Notch signaling eliciting the latent neurogenic program in astrocytes after stoke (Magnusson et al., 2014) may have a synergistic effect on the post-ischemic NSPC differentiation to astrocytes. Functional restoration via multipotent NSPC function: Outcome after cell therapy is mediated by diverse mechanisms underlying functional improvements in the post-stroke recovery. Our study implies that NSPC therapy comprised primarily of promoted neurogenesis to a glial lineage that emerges shortly after initiating the therapy in the ischemia-subjected brain tissue (Kopach et al., 2018). This initial stage includes supplying the damaged tissue with the NSPC-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – the output assuming the glia-related neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. The stem cell-derived astrocytes enhance the viability of brain cells by secreting various neurotrophic factors and supporting cell regeneration, evidenced for improving neurological function of post-stroke brain (Jiang et al., 2013), whereas oligodendrocytes' role has been proven in re-myelination and axon regeneration, both essential to synaptic networking (Figure 2). Such glial-directed differentiation of NSPC grafts, driven by overactivated master regulators that heavily burden the post-ischemic tissue, may mirror endogenous mechanism of boosting the glia-mediated tissue clearance following ischemic neuronal cell death. As the cellular debris became cleared and pro-apoptotic and inflammatory mediators recede, multipotent NSPC neurogenesis towards neuronal maturation takes place, which is the longer lasting process. Indeed, the ability of multipotent stem cells to mature with higher efficacy to neurons in astrocyte co-cultures had been evidenced. Other roles of glial cells have included the active astrocytic contribution to synapse formation, plasticity and remodeling that should facilitate network remodeling in the post-stroke tissue.Figure 2: The current concept of NSPC-therapy in stroke-related neurodegeneration encompasses the multipotent differentiation of NSPC grafts in a host tissue for replacement of various neural phenotypes after ischemia-induced cell loss for restoring the function in multiple ways.Conclusions and future perspectives: Ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is one of the leading causes of the brain damage that results in high rate of mortality and severe disability in patients after stroke (series of strokes). The stroke-related neurodegeneration gives rise to numerous neurological disorders, including cognitive decline (vascular dementia), motor disability (paralysis), and others associated with a wide range of impairments. Massive neuronal death after stroke could be barely overcame only by pharmacological interventions, but requires also implementation of cell therapies for replacement strategies. Although the long history of stem cell research had provided conceptual advances and clinical relevance of cell-based therapy, it has been less understood the neurophysiological basis of such tremendous effects of stem cells on the post-stroke recovery of brain function. Because recovery of the brain is not a single process, it is essential to clearly define the precise timing required for maturing of neurophysiological activity, ranging from intrinsic excitability to network function, for the entirely different stem cell-derived phenotypes. Dissecting this will expand the knowledge about stem cell therapy to find how best to use multiple routes of the therapy (induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells) for the stroke-related neurodegeneration. More work is needed on defining the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell neurogenesis to provide the field with a meaningful consideration of cell therapy in context of promoting 'self-repair' of the post-stroke brain by engaging endogenous brain recovery mechanisms to power self-renewal. The perspective remains in accelerating neurophysiological maturation of neuronal phenotypes in the post-ischemic tissue tailored to enhancing the functional influence and, thereby, maximizing beneficial effects. Understanding the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell grafts will foster cell therapy use to augment therapeutic interventions in stroke-related neurodegeneration and to improve ultimate outcome.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also called substance dependence or dependence syndrome, is a condition where a person feels a strong need to take a drug. Addiction also involves other behaviors. These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal. When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug. For example, Heroin is a drug that is in the Opiate class, which means that a person addicted to Heroin may also be seen to have an addiction to other opiates such as Morphine. A person who may easily become addicted to drugs is said to have an addictive personality. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines drug addiction as a mental disorder. Drug addiction is often linked with other mental disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn the present book, fifteen typical literatures about drug addiction published on international authoritative journals were selected to introduce the worldwide newest progress, which contains reviews or original researches on human health, illegal drugs, neuroscience, psychology, ect. We hope this book can demonstrate advances in drug addiction as well as give references to the researchers, students and other related people.",

Fizicka ovisnost je stanje izazvano ponavljajucim uzimanjem droge koje zahtjeva njezino kontinuirano uzimanje kako bi se sprijecilo nastajanje neugodnih simptoma apstinencije te kako bi se postiglo djelovanje kakvo je u pocetku izazivala manja kolicina psihoaktivne tvari. Postoji i kombinacija psihicke i fizicke ovisnosti. Ovisnost je kronicna recidivirajuca bolest, koja zahtijeva specijaliziran tretman, dugotrajnu skrb i pracenje. Prema nacinu djelovanja na svijest, razlikujemo: stimulanse, depresante, opioide, halucinogene, nikotin i marihuanu. Najcesce supstance odnosno psihoaktivne tvari koje ovisnik koristi su: opijum, sinteticki opijati-amfetamin, heroin, kokain (crack i list koke) te kanabis. Zlouporaba droga prisutna je u svim dobnim skupinama, a najveci postotak prisutan je kod adolescenata. Neki od razloga posezanja mladih za drogom su nedostatak pravih životih vrijednosti, modernizacija drustva, zanemarivanje od strane roditelja i bliskih osoba, nedovoljna posvecenost drustva, nezrelost, psihicka nestabilnost, znatiželja te velika rasirenost psihoaktivnih tvari. Ovisnik se neprimjereno ponasa, zanemaruje svoje obaveze, mijenja mu se dustveni život i okruženje, gubi prijatelje, dolazi do napetosti i sukoba u obitelji te raskidanja ili narusavanja bliskih veza. Zadatak zdravstvenih djelatnika je predlaganje i provođenje specificnih i konkretnih mjera kako bi se zlouporaba sredstava ovisnosti držala u granicama podnosljivosti za zajednicu.

Vrlo su cesti recidivi, narocito u drugoj fazi lijecenja u kojoj se ovisnika uci i navikava na život bez droge. Za lijecenje ovisnosti o psihoaktivnim tvarima važan je veliki trud i svakodnevno zalaganje zdravstvenog tima te podrska u grupnim terapijama i podrska obitelji.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Medical Emergencies Associated with Psychotropic Medications",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychotropic medications form an integral part of the management of various psychiatric disorders. However, psychotropic medications are associated with specific side effects, which can manifest as medical emergencies. Some of these side effects are rare, whereas some are relatively more common [Table 1]. Some of the medical emergencies arise due to the toxic doses of these medications. Some of these side effects are obvious (for example, acute dystonia and akathisia), and the association with the ongoing psychotropic medicines is easy to establish. If these medical emergencies are not identified in time and intervened, some side effects can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. However, for some of these side effects, a high index of suspicion is required, and there is a need to rule out other possible causes before attributing the side effect to the ongoing psychotropic medication.Table 1: Medical emergencies due to use of or overdose of psychotropic medicationsThis guideline provides an overview for evaluating patients presenting with medical emergencies due to the ongoing psychotropic medications or intake of psychotropics in overdose. It provides an overview of how to assess and manage patients presenting with these medical emergencies. These guidelines are not a substitute for clinical knowledge, and every patient presenting with these features will require individualized assessment and management. These guidelines are limited to the life-threatening medical emergencies for which a definite etiological association between psychotropics and medical emergencies is established, or the crisis is related to the overdose of the medication. We are aware of other life-threatening side effects of psychotropics that can present as medical emergencies. An association between these presentations and psychotropics is reported, but a definite causal association is not established. ACUTE DYSTONIAS Acute dystonia is characterized by sudden involuntary contraction of muscles resulting in repetitive or twisting movements. These are usually seen during the initial days of starting antipsychotic medications. This can manifest as focal dystonia (affecting only one part of the body) or generalized dystonia (involving all body parts). The dystonia can be painful to the sufferers. The antipsychotic-induced dystonia is defined as \"sustained abnormal postures or muscle spasms that develop within seven days of starting antipsychotics or while rapidly increasing the dose of the antipsychotic medication, or of reducing the medication used to treat (or prevent) acute extrapyramidal symptoms (i.e., removal of anticholinergic agents).\"[1] The literature has reported a vast prevalence range, varying from 2% to 90%.[2] The differential risk of acute dystonia with various antipsychotics is influenced by their differential dopamine–acetylcholine antagonism, with higher levels of dopamine–acetylcholine antagonism associated with greater chances of developing acute dystonia. It usually involves the neck muscles (cervical dystonia–torticollis) and manifests as head twisting/turning to one side, backward, or forward. Besides the neck muscles, the dystonias associated with the use of antipsychotics can affect the eyelids (manifest as blepharospasm), jaw (oromandibular dystonia manifesting as slurring of speech and drooling of saliva along with difficulty in chewing and swallowing), tongue (lingual dystonia), and laryngeal muscles (laryngeal dystonia, manifesting as difficulty in speaking). Sometimes, the hands or only the fingers may be involved. Rarely, the generalized form of acute dystonia may manifest as opisthotonus. Among the various forms, laryngeal dystonia can lead to striders and be life-threatening. Multiple risk factors have been identified for precipitation of acute dystonia associated with the use of antipsychotics [Table 2].[2]Table 2: Risk factors for the development of acute dystonias with antipsychotics[2]A specific type of dystonia that involves eye muscles, known as an oculogyric crisis, can occur when the patient is on a stable dose of antipsychotics. The various precipitating factors for oculogyric crisis include the use of alcohol, some emotional stress, fatigue, and suggestibility.[2] In almost all cases (95%), acute dystonia manifests within 4 days of starting an antipsychotics or after a significant increase in the dose of the antipsychotic.[2] Differential diagnosis In terms of differential diagnosis of acute dystonia induced by antipsychotics, the other medications which can cause acute dystonia must be considered, which can include metoclopramide.[2] Other differential diagnoses include dissociation, catatonia, tardive dystonia (usually seen after months to years of antipsychotic use and do not improve rapidly after the use of anticholinergic medications), temporal lobe epilepsy, which can lead to bizarre postures, and hypocalcemia. While establishing the diagnosis of antipsychotic-associated acute dystonia, the possibility of dystonia related to other medications [Table 3] and substance of abuse must also be kept in mind, as often antipsychotics are prescribed along with other concomitant agents and patients with mental illness also have a high prevalence of substance abuse.Table 3: Medications and substances other than antipsychotics which have also been reported to cause acute dystonia[2]Management Acute dystonia is an acute emergency that requires immediate intervention. Occurrence of dystonia can disrupt the therapeutic alliance. The management of acute dystonia involves the intramuscular or intravenous administration of an anticholinergic medication or an antihistaminic agent [Table 4]. Usually, the symptoms resolve within 15–20 min. Most patients respond to the first dose of the injectable medication, with only very few patients requiring repetition of the second or third dose of drugs. However, suppose a patient does not respond to two doses of medication. In that case, a change in the medication should be considered. If this does not lead to the desired result, then a diagnosis other than acute dystonia associated with antipsychotics should be considered.Table 4: Stepwise management of antipsychotic-associated acute dystoniaOnce the acute dystonia is managed with various agents, it is recommended to continue anticholinergic agents for at least 24–48 h to avoid recurrence of acute dystonia. However, in routine clinical practice, the anticholinergic agents are continued up to 4–7 days. In routine clinical practice, some clinicians prefer to use prophylactic anticholinergic agents rather than allowing acute dystonia to emerge. However, everyday use of anticholinergic agents is not recommended. The use of the prophylactic anticholinergic agents should consider the risk factors for the development of acute dystonia, type and dose of antipsychotic use, and the concomitant medications.[2] AKATHISIA The term akathisia is derived from Greek and means \"inability to sit.\" It is characterized by a subjective feeling of inner restlessness and objective restlessness, as observed by others. A sense of dysphoria usually accompanies it and the patient complains of a mounting tension when he/she tries to remain still. In terms of objective evidence, the patient would appear to have difficulty sitting/standing/lying at one place for a long time. Acute akathisia is usually seen during the initial few hours or days of starting antipsychotics. The risk for developing acute akathisia is high in patients receiving antipsychotics for the first time, rapid escalation of antipsychotic doses, and polypharmacy with antipsychotics. Different types of akathisia described in the literature include: Acute akathisia Chronic akathisia (akathisia lasting for at least 3 months) Withdrawal akathisia (seen within 6 weeks of reduction in the dose or stopping of antipsychotics) Tardive akathisia (seen after a long duration of use of antipsychotics). These must be considered in the differential diagnosis before the diagnosis of acute akathisia is made. Management The first step in managing akathisia involves proper assessment to confirm the diagnosis of akathisia. Assessment of akathisia consists in taking a good history and carrying out a physical examination to distinguish different types of akathisia and ruling out the other differential diagnoses [Table 5]. Akathisia is also associated with a high risk of suicidal behavior. Hence, patients with akathisia should also be appropriately evaluated for suicidality. A commonly used scale to assess subjective and objective aspects of akathisia includes Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS). It is recommended that BARS should be used before starting or increasing the dose of antipsychotics.Table 5: Differential diagnosis of akathisiaThe treatment of akathisia involves a reduction in the dose of an offending antipsychotic agent or changing to another antipsychotic with a lower propensity to cause akathisia (low-potency first-generation antipsychotic or a second antipsychotic medication, like quetiapine). Other options include the use of anti-akathisia medications. The various options include beta-blockers, 5HT2A receptor antagonists, anticholinergic agents, dopamine agonists, GABAergic agents, benzodiazepines, and Vitamin B6 [Table 6]. Beta-blockers are usually considered the first-line and gold standard agent for the management of akathisia. However, it is important to remember that beta-blockers cannot be used in all patients. Some of the contraindications for the use of beta-blockers include hypotension, bradycardia, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and cardiac conduction defects. In such a situation, mirtazapine, which is a 5HT2A receptor antagonist, is considered to be an alternative first-line agent. The second alternative medication includes Vitamin B6.[34]Table 6: Management of akathisiaNEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME, SEROTONIN SYNDROME, AND ANTICHOLINERGIC SYNDROME Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Various psychotropics can lead to life-threatening side effects, which have a typical clinical picture. These patients can present with neurological manifestations in rigidity, change in reflex response, and altered sensorium. Reviewing the history of medication intake, proper physical examination, and carrying out appropriate investigations are helpful clues to the diagnosis. These side effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic syndrome. If these syndromes are not recognized in time and managed appropriately, these can be life-threatening. NMS is a rare but life-threatening idiosyncratic side effect of antipsychotic medications. It has been reported with almost all antipsychotic drugs. Besides antipsychotics, NMS has also been reported with other medications such as mood stabilizers and metoclopramide. The incidence rate of NMS has varied across different studies and is influenced by various methodological issues. The available data suggest an incidence rate of 0.02%–3.23%.[56] The typical picture of NMS is characterized by fever, rigidity, altered sensorium, and autonomic disturbances.[7] Various risk factors have been identified for the development of NMS [Table 7]. In terms of etiology, different etiological mechanisms have been suggested, with one of the most accepted hypotheses suggesting the clinical picture of NMS to be an outcome of dopaminergic antagonism at the D2 receptors in the central nervous system, which triggers a cascade that impairs the thermoregulatory response of the body, which degrades the dissipation of heat and increased production of heat in the body.[89]Table 7: Risk factors for neuroleptic malignant syndrome[8 9 10 11 12 13]Clinical features The clinical features of NMS are usually seen during the initial few days after starting antipsychotic medications. Majority of the patients who develop NMS do so within 10 days of starting antipsychotic, with almost all cases beginning within 30 days of beginning antipsychotics.[9] However, this should not be understood as NMS cannot occur after this time frame. The typical picture of NMS is characterized by fever, rigidity (lead pipe), altered sensorium, and autonomic disturbances (increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, excessive sweating, sustained or labile hypertension, and hypersalivation). Some of the authors have tried to define the evolution of NMS in five stages, with stage 5 being the most severe form characterized by extreme lead pipe rigidity, heart rate in the range of 130–150 beats per min, systolic blood pressure ranging from 140 to 210 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ranging from 100 to 110 mmHg, and body temperature in the range of 39°C–42°C, accompanied by catatonia and coma.[14] Diagnostic criteria Different diagnostic criteria have been proposed by different authors, including Addonizio criteria,[15] Adityanjee criteria,[16] Caroff and Mann's criteria,[17] Levenson's criteria,[7] Nirenberg criteria,[18] and Pope's criteria.[19] Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), the fifth revision,[20] has also provided the diagnostic criteria for NMS. All these criteria define NMS using similar features, with some variation given to different components, including the rise in serum creatine phosphokinase levels. According to DSM-5 criteria,[20] a patient is required to fulfill all the three primary criteria (exposure to the dopamine-blocking agent, severe muscle rigidity, and fever) and at least two other measures (diaphoresis, dysphagia, tremor, incontinence, altered level of consciousness, mutism, tachycardia, elevated or labile blood pressure, leukocytosis, and elevated creatine phosphokinase). Recently, a consensus criterion, i.e., International Expert Consensus NMS diagnostic criteria,[21] has been developed, which gives variable weightage to different symptoms. In the end, a total score is calculated, with a cutoff of 74 indicative of a diagnosis of NMS equivalent to DSM-IV TR criteria.[22] Serotonin syndrome Serotonin syndrome is a life-threatening side effect arising due to serotonin toxicity. The level of serotonin influences features of serotonin syndrome toxicity and the term serotonin syndrome is primarily used to denote the extreme end of the toxicity. It is usually seen in patients receiving more than one serotonergic agent, those receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with other medications, which can inhibit the metabolism of serotonergic agents at the CYP3A4 enzyme level and resultantly lead to an increase in the serotonin levels, or patients with medication overdose. Many medications have been implicated in the development of serotonin syndrome [Table 8].[2324252627]Table 8: Medications that can lead to the development of serotonin syndrome (adapted from[23 24 25 26 27])Severe serotonin syndrome is usually reported in those using more than one serotonergic medication in therapeutic doses or doses more than recommended, especially when monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are combined with another agent. If unrecognized, serotonin syndrome can be fatal and lead to death. The underlying mechanism for the development of serotonin syndrome includes an increase in the synthesis or release of serotonin, reduction in uptake or metabolism of serotonin, and direct activation of serotonin receptors.[24252627] Clinical features The clinical features of serotonin syndrome can vary as per the severity of the syndrome. The clinical features usually appear early, i.e., 6–24 h after the ingestion of the offending agents. However, in some instances, the clinical presentation may be delayed. The classical triad of serotonin syndrome includes altered mental status, autonomic overactivity, and neuromuscular hyperactivity [Table 9].[23242526]Table 9: Clinical features of serotonin syndrome (adapted from[24 25 26 27 28])Diagnostic criteria Two different diagnostic criteria have been proposed to diagnose serotonin syndrome, i.e., Hunter criteria and Sternbach's criteria. The Hunter criteria are decision-making criteria, which consider the use of serotonergic agents and the presence of clonus. Accordingly, serotonin toxicity should be considered to be present if the patient has either of the following: spontaneous clonus, inducible clonus, and agitation or diaphoresis, ocular clonus and agitation or diaphoresis, tremor and hyperreflexia only, hypertonia along with the temperature of >38°C, and ocular clonus or inducible clonus.[27] Sternbach's criteria require three out of the ten given clinical features, i.e., mental status changes (confusion and hypomania), agitation, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, tremor, diarrhea, incoordination, and fever. Additionally, these criteria also mention ruling out other etiologies and the absence of starting a neuroleptic agent or an increase in the dose of neuroleptics before the onset of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome.[28] Anticholinergic syndrome The anticholinergic syndrome arises due to intentional or accidental intake of anticholinergic medications or other compounds. The clinical manifestations are an outcome of antagonisms of acetylcholine in the brain and the peripheral nervous system. Therapeutic use of drugs with high anticholinergic properties can also lead to precipitation of the anticholinergic syndrome. Many medications have been reported to be associated with the development of anticholinergic syndrome [Table 10]. However, it is essential to note that this is not the complete list, and many other medications have also been reported to have a variable level of anticholinergic properties. Various scales like the Anticholinergic Burden Scale have been designed to assess the anticholinergic burden of different medications. The various risk factors for the development of anticholinergic syndrome include older age and medications with anticholinergic properties, which can have an additive effect. Other risk factors include the use of certain street drugs and herbal products/medications that also have high anticholinergic properties [Table 10].[2930]Table 10: Medications implicated for causing anticholinergic syndrome (adapted from[29])Clinical features The clinical features of the anticholinergic syndrome can be quite variable, ranging from only mild cognitive syndromes to a full-blown anticholinergic syndrome characterized by central and peripheral signs and symptoms [Table 11]. The majority of the manifestations are due to the involvement of the muscarinic receptors. The anticholinergic syndrome may also worsen preexisting medical conditions among the elderly, including precipitation of angina, congestive cardiac failure, severe constipation, urinary retention, and narrow-angle glaucoma. Hence, the elderly presenting with worsening conditions or these manifestations should also be evaluated for anticholinergic burden.[2930]Table 11: Clinical manifestations of anticholinergic syndrome[29]Diagnostic criteria There are no specific diagnostic criteria for the anticholinergic syndrome. The diagnosis usually depended on the clinician's awareness about this condition and the ability to recognize the same symptoms.[2930] ASSESSMENT Assessment of a patient presenting to the emergency with altered sensorium and autonomic and neurological symptoms should alter the psychiatrist about possible clinical presentation due to the ongoing psychotropic medications. However, the clinician should consider all possible organic causes for the altered sensorium before attributing the whole clinical presentation to the continuing medicines. It is also essential to understand that these syndromes associated with various groups of medications can also lead to multiple complications. A good history, carrying out a proper physical examination, and the findings backed by appropriate investigations can help reach a diagnosis. For NMS, the clinician should focus on the temporal correlation of onset of symptoms with starting antipsychotic medication while taking history. Additionally, the dose of the antipsychotic used and the rate of increasing the antipsychotics should be thoroughly evaluated. Other issues to be considered include looking at the concomitant medications and comorbidities. During the physical examination, the clinician should focus on fever, rigidity, sensorium, dehydration, autonomic disturbances, the color of the urine, etc. Additionally, efforts should be made to rule out other differential diagnoses [Table 12].[923242526272931]Table 12: Differential diagnosis for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic syndrome[9 23 24 25 26 27 29 31]For serotonin syndrome, while taking history, the clinician should focus on the prescribed serotonergic agents and inquire about the use of over-the-counter medications, illicit drugs, and various dietary supplements such as St John's wort, ginseng, tryptophan, and appetite suppressants. While carrying out the physical examination, a close watch should be kept on the various vital parameters and autonomic abnormalities. The neurological examination should focus on the elicitation of clonus, as this is considered the cardinal manifestation of serotonin syndrome as per Hunter's criteria. An important fact to remember while carrying out the neurological examination is that hyperreflexia and clonus are more often seen in the lower limbs. The diagnosis is usually based on the high index of suspicion and ruling out another differential diagnosis [Table 12].[923242526272931] Besides the differential diagnosis listed in Table 8, a differential diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome must also be considered in a patient with serotonin syndrome.[2324252627] Similarly, while history taking, if the anticholinergic syndrome is suspected, the clinician should focus on the whole prescription and evaluate the total anticholinergic burden, rather than just focusing on the single implicating agent. While carrying out a physical examination, attention must be paid to the skin, the blurring of vision, dryness of mouth, cardiovascular manifestations, urinary retention, and ataxia.[2930] However, it sometimes becomes difficult to distinguish between NMS, serotonin syndrome, anticholinergic syndrome, and malignant hyperthermia. This is especially the case if the patient is on polypharmacy or when the medication history is not available or clear. In such a situation, it is important to focus on the specific manifestation of these syndromes [Table 13].[923242526272931]Table 13: Distinguishing features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic syndrome[9 23 24 25 26 27, 29 31 32 33]MANAGEMENT The detailed workup of a patient suspected to have either of these syndromes requires stopping the offending medications, efforts to confirm the diagnosis, ruling out another differential diagnosis, treating the syndrome, and preventing the development of complications [Figure 1].Figure 1: Steps in the management of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic syndromesThe first step in managing these syndromes should include the stoppage of the offending agent(s). This is often straightforward in NMS and serotonin syndrome. However, it is often tricky in anticholinergic syndrome, especially among the elderly, who have multiple physical comorbidities and receive numerous medications with variable anticholinergic properties. Accordingly, while history taking especial emphasis must be given to look for the agent which was added the last or whose doses were changed in the recent times. If such an agent is evident, the medication needs to be stopped, provided the symptoms are of mild severity. However, if such information is not available, all the medicines must be evaluated for their anticholinergic properties, and those with high anticholinergic burden should be stopped. However, it is essential to remember that stopping these agents can destabilize the underlying physical illnesses. Hence, appropriate substitute medications with low or no anticholinergic properties must be considered. Investigations for patients suspected of these syndromes are also guided by the diagnosis and differential diagnoses being considered and the overall clinical picture [Table 14].[923242526272931]Table 14: Investigations in a patient suspected to have neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, or anticholinergic syndrome[9 23 24 25 26 27 29 31]Supportive care Supportive measures are required to manage the symptoms and prevent the development of complications. These may include measures to reduce the temperature, treat or prevent dehydration, ensure proper nutrition, and avoid organ damage, such as renal impairment in patients with NMS. Supportive measures can also include the use of benzodiazepines, if the physical health permits, to manage agitation [Table 15]. After initial stabilization, if required, gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal may be considered in patients with anticholinergic syndrome if the history suggests recent intake (i.e., <1 h) of agents in overdoses.[923242526272931]Table 15: Supportive measures in a patient suspected to have neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, or anticholinergic syndrome[9 23 24 25 26 27 29 31]Use of specific agents or antidotes The particular agents for managing NMS include bromocriptine, dantrolene, amantadine, or dopamine agonists [Table 16]. Among these agents, bromocriptine is one of the most commonly used agents, which can be given in doses of 10–40 mg/day in divided doses. If the patient does not respond to these agents, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be considered. It is important to remember that if ECT is considered, succinylcholine should be used cautiously, given common pathophysiology of NMS and malignant hyperthermia.[931] Mild cases of serotonin syndrome can be managed with supportive care and the addition of benzodiazepines. Moderate and severe cases will require the addition of serotonin antagonists, i.e., cyproheptadine. A loading dose of 12 mg orally or through a nasogastric tube, followed by 2 mg every 2 hourly until clinical improvement is seen or 8 mg, 6 h after the symptoms have settled, is recommended. Severe cases of serotonin syndrome will require intensive supportive care to manage the symptoms and prevent complications (such as severe hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) and administration of serotonin antagonists. Patients with severe serotonin syndrome may require muscle paralysis with nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, i.e., vecuronium. Opioids should be avoided in the management of serotonin syndrome. In patients with the anticholinergic syndrome, the use of physostigmine may be considered. However, it is important to note that the use of physostigmine is not without risk as it may worsen underlying physical health conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, cardiac problems, glaucoma, and psychosis.[2324252627]Table 16: Pharmacotherapy for neuroleptic malignant syndrome[9 31]Restarting of psychotropics for the underlying mental illness Once the symptoms of NMS resolve, it is usually recommended to restart the antipsychotics only after at least after 2 weeks of resolution of symptoms. Because of the risk of recurrence, it is always advisable to monitor the patient while rechallenging the patient with antipsychotics closely.[931] There is a lack of consensus on when to restart the antidepressants in patients with serotonin syndrome once the patient recovers from serotonin syndrome. Ideally, a gap of 1–2 weeks must be considered, and if started, the patient and caregivers should be psychoeducated about the prevention of serotonin syndrome. This should include avoiding illicit drugs, prescription medications, dietary supplements, and herbal preparation that increase serotonergic transmission. Further, while restarting antidepressants, the doses should be increased slowly with close monitoring for symptoms of psychosis.[2324252627] PSYCHOTROPIC TOXICITIES AND OVERDOSE Lithium toxicity Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window, and the therapeutic range for serum lithium varies from 0.4 to 1.2 mEq/L. The clinical features of lithium toxicity are usually seen when the serum lithium levels are >1.5 mEq/L. However, it is essential to remember that the toxic effects of lithium may also be seen in patients with therapeutic serum levels. The life-threatening side effects of lithium usually appear when the serum level is >2 mEq/L. In terms of toxicity, three different types of lithium toxicities have been described in the literature, which include acute (primarily manifests with gastrointestinal symptoms, and may progress to neuromuscular signs and symptoms which usually appear after 2–3 days), acute-on-chronic (presents with both gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms), and chronic (present primarily with neurological symptoms) toxicities. Acute toxicity is usually seen in patients with lithium overdose. Chronic lithium toxicity is seen in patients who are on long-term lithium treatment. The toxicity manifestations are generally an outcome of either an alteration in the absorption or elimination of lithium levels. For example, any change in renal functioning (due to renal damage, hypovolemia, and use of medications that increase lithium's reabsorption) can impair the elimination of lithium and resultant accumulation of lithium levels in the body [Table 17]. Acute on chronic toxicity is seen in patients on long-term lithium, who take overdoses of lithium, either deliberately or accidentally.[34353637]Table 17: Risk factors for lithium toxicity in patients on long-term lithium treatmentUsually, the severity of lithium toxicity in patients with chronic lithium intoxication (i.e., those on long-term lithium therapy) is determined by the serum level",

      "abstract": "Editor—Sanfilippo syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) encompasses a group of four lysosomal storage disorders resulting from a failure to break down the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate. Each of the four subtypes, A, B, C, and D, is caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme in the degradative pathway of heparan sulphate: heparan-N-sulphatase (EC 3.10.1.1), α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC3.2.1.50), acetyl-CoA N-acetyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.3), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphatase (EC 3.1.6.14), respectively.1 Clinical symptoms usually occur after two years of apparently normal development and include hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, delayed development (particularly in speech), sleep disturbances, coarse hair, hirsutism, and diarrhoea. There are only relatively mild somatic manifestations. There then follows a period of progressive mental retardation with death usually between the second and third decade of life. In a small number of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, there is a more slowly progressive form of the disease with later onset known as the attenuated phenotype.2-4 A late onset phenotype has also been described for Sanfilippo syndrome type A.5 \n\nSanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme heparan-N-sulphatase (sulphamidase).

      "abstract": "Detailed history taking is of paramount importance to establish a reliable diagnosis in patients with transient loss of consciousness. In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.",

These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

Drugs such as methylphenidate, amphetamine compounds and modafinil have been trialed and used in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep conditions, cocaine dependence and as an adjunct to antidepressants for depression. All these drugs, like stimulant drugs abuse, increase extracellular dopamine in the brain.This effect is associated with reinforcing as well as therapeutic effects. Methylphenidate and modafinil treatment of ADHD are associated with a reduced risk for later substance abuse among ADHD patients. There is evidence of the beneficial effects of the use of modafinil in cocaine dependence, altough there isn´t conclusive evidence for the stimulants´ efficacy in treatment of the stimulants´ dependence. At this time, the physiopathology of drug abuse and dependence is unknown, but it´s known that the very critical point is that the reinforcing effects are associated with rapid changes in dopamine increases, whereas the therapeutic effects are associated with slowly and smoothly rising dopamine levels, such as are achieved with low doses and oral administration. Due to this, it´s necessary to study the neurobiological bases on which stimulants drugs are related, and their clinical use in dependence treatments.",

Among elderly people, most falls result from the concurrence of several risk factors and a trigger. Taking medication can significantly influence the tendency to fall. Adverse drug reactions such as hypotension or the inhibition of motor or cognitive skills are often the cause of falling. In each case it must be determined whether the use of a medication is solely an indicator of a functional disorder or acts as an independent risk factor for falling. Pharmacists can help reduce the risk of falling by advising elderly patients on a medication's side effects and its interaction with other medications as well as on additional risk factors.",

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

Both old and new antiepileptic drugs may exacerbate seizures, but carbamazepine-induced generalized seizures (such as absence and myoclonic) are best documented. More than one pathophysiological mechanism is probably involved in drug-related exacerbation of seizures, such as sedative and pro-convulsive effects of high serum levels, drug-associated encephalopathy, and a paradoxical pharmacodynamic effect. Accurate epilepsy- and seizure classification is important in the treatment of all types of epilepsy. Atypical absences are sometimes mistaken for complex partial seizures. Such patients may be given drugs with a narrow spectrum such as sodium channel blockers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine) or GABAergic agents (e.g. vigabatrin, tiagabine) with an increased risk of seizure exacerbation. Those at greatest risk of experiencing drug-related seizure exacerbation are learning-disabled patients, children with severe epileptic encephalopathies, those with high seizure frequency and several seizure types, and those using polytherapy.",

      "abstract": "Diseases of the peripheral nervous system are ranking a leading position among other neurological nosologies. And polyneuropathy is known as more prevalent and severe disease. Numerous scientific reports highlight issues on different pathological conditions in relation to polyneuropathy, and in particular intoxications, hypovitaminosis (isolated or as complications of certain pathological processes), infectious and hereditary diseases, paraneoplastic syndromes, metabolic disorders, allergic reactions. These diseases when uncontrolled or untreated may result in the development of complications, among which is polyneuropathy. The diagnosis of polyneuropathy is relatively not difficult, because the disease is manifested as distal symmetrical sensory and/or motor impairments with transient disorders of autonomic nervous system. Diabetic polyneuropathy, in particular, is a late complication of diabetes mellitus, which determines the prognosis of the disease. Alcoholic polyneuropathy in a form of acute, subacute or chronic current variants is caused by the combined effects of thiamine toxicity and vitamin deficiency. At the same time, dysmetabolic polyneuropathies differ by variability of clinical manifestations and the general developmental patterns of the nerve conduction block that is determined by the peculiarities of degenerative and regenerative processes under different pathogenetic factors. Differential diagnosis of polyneuropathies is mainly based on the detection of somatic pathology and the comparison of the dynamic changes in the course of the diseases and clinical manifestations. The study has demonstrated diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies have clear distinct clinical-neurophysiological patterns. The article also highlights the treatment outcomes of combination therapy with pregabalin for diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies.",

      "title": "Psychodynamic Aspects of Reserpine: Its Uses and Effects in Open Psychiatric Settings",
      "abstract": "1) Reserpine is a remarkable and useful drug. It has a definite place in psychiatry for the alleviation of selected symptoms. It is not in any sense a psychic “specific”. 2) The physiologic effects of this drug are relatively constant. The principal ones are a fall in blood pressure, a relative bradycardia, and in adequate dosage, a slowing of the patient's spontaneous activity; feelings of weakness, tiredness and of being held down. 3) There are other effects, which are predominantly psychological and it is felt that they have nothing to do with the physiological effects per se. They are the result of the way in which the physiological action fits into the patient's way of handling and expressing his conflict (i.e. defenses). When a patient does badly it is due to the way in which the physiological effects psychologically threaten the patient. A patient does well or badly depending on this, and we have seen enhanced anxiety as well as psychoses produced by both reserpine and chlorpromazine (8). 4) Because of the above, psychotherapeutic efforts are of the greatest importance, and when used, usually overshadow the effects of the drug. We feel that no patient is treated in a vacuum. Milieu and relationship is what counts most. The other factors, though important, are adjuvants. 5) A level of 10 to 40 mg./day will control most motor over-activity. Anxiety and most panics can be handled at between 2 and 10 mg./day. The average daily dose was 7 mg./day. The average length of treatment was 26 days. 6) Side effects are frequent, but are rapidly reversible. There were no serious or irreversible toxic effects. The drug is remarkably safe. 7) Reserpine is of about the same usefulness as chlorpromazine in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is quicker acting. Reserpine is safer. When the G.I. tract is irritated or the site of symptoms, chlorpromazine is preferable. Cardiac or cardiovascular symptomatology might indicate a preference for reserpine, especially when bradycardia is desirable. Neither is a “specific” curative agent. Both are useful for the symptomatic relief of selected symptoms. Both have their contra indications. Neither is an effective substitute for intimate human contact with the patient.

      "abstract": "Presumed toxic exposures have a connotation that can be alarming to any individual; thus, an inferred or assumed toxic trigger leading to myriad, vague symptoms, or complaints is frequently encountered in the outpatient clinic setting. For a toxicological cause to be considered, several factors should be present. Probably, the most important association is a temporal relationship; for example, the peaked therapeutic effect of a drug may be temporally associated with its peak adverse effect. In general, intravenous administration of a drug will elicit an adverse effect in a much shorter time period than oral or transdermal drug administration. Questionnaires can be furnished to assist in biological validity of complaints. Such areas of focus could include demographic characteristics, symptom development, mood states, or hazard exposures. Extensive neuropsychological testing may be indicated; although, even then it may be difficult to identify malingering.",

      "abstract": "Droxidopa is a first-in-class, orally available, synthetic amino acid precursor of norepinephrine that received accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval in February 2014 after Orphan Drug status for a debilitating condition known as symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Neurogenic disorders often lead to postural hypotension as a result of poor norepinephrine release from its storage sites. Clinical data suggest increases in standing systolic blood pressure and improvements in many other markers for subjective relief in patients with symptomatic neurogenic hypotension who received droxidopa therapy over 1–2 weeks. Studies evaluating the sustained effects of droxidopa are ongoing. With minimal drug interactions (even with carbidopa use) or adverse effects, droxidopa therapy can be used safely in patients with a variety of neurologic conditions; however, more data are needed to determine its appropriate pharmacotherapeutic role. In all, droxidopa is a safe and effective medication for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness/lightheadedness, or the “feeling that you are about to black out” in adult patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension secondary to primary autonomic failure (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy.",

I. The author considers the problems of psychotropic drugs in Japan in 2 categories: those unique to Japan (1-5) and those related to psychotropic drugs in general (6-9). 1. \"Arbitrary\" administration (i. e., the prescription is different with each psychiatrist, therefore standardization is necessary). 2. Polypharmacy (i. e., unreasonable combination is made). 3. Many different drugs with similar effect (therefore, new drugs should be controlled). 4. \"Stereotype\" of doctor's prescription for long-term use. 5. Limited prescription due to health insurances. 6. Doubtful effect on long-term prognosis of chronic schizophrenics. 7. Psycho-social burden of patients taking drugs continuously. 8. Undesirable effects like prolongation of depressive episode, lowered mental activity, or blunting of affect. 9. Side effects such as dependence, tardive dyskinesia, malignant syndrome, or teratogenecity. II. Tardive dyskinesea, malignant syndrome and teratogenecity are explained in detail. III. The author expresses the wishes for future development of psychotropic drugs as follows: 1. Good balance of \"effect\", \"side effect\", and \"price\" of clinical drugs. 2. Introduction of safe long-acting drugs which promote social rehabilitation of mental patients. 3. Development of more specifically effective drugs. 4. Convenient way of measurement of drug serum level. 5. Contribution to understanding of pathogenesis of mental disorders through researches on effects and side effects of drugs. Finally, the author stresses the necessity of more cooperation between clinical and basic medicine.",

The reasons for this finding may be different neonatal/infant physiology, higher degree of illness, more complex surgical procedures and the effects of anesthesia and analgesia on developing brain. Importantly, the possible effects of blood pressure and cerebral perfusion changes during and after the surgery have to be elucidated in the future [2]. A relatively large volume of animal data evaluating toxicity of anesthetic and analgesic agents on developing brain exists. Data from rodents and newborn monkeys have linked different agents to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, such as memory loss [3] and learning difficulties [4]. The most commonly cited mechanisms of injury are increased apoptosis, impaired dendritic arborization and spine formation, changes in neurogenesis and neuronal cytoskeleton as well as altered mitochondrial function [5].",

Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil.

      "abstract": "Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent symptoms encountered by physicians in their daily clinical practice. This symptom may be broadly subdivided into primary (so-called 'idiopathic' or 'functional') constipation and secondary constipation; the latter is associated with endocrine, metabolic and neurological disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease), luminal obstruction (e.g., colon neoplasms) and use of drugs (e.g., anticholinergics and opioids) [1]. Here, we will focus on some known etiologic factors underlying primary constipation. The definition of constipation varies greatly according to the descriptor (layman, patient, physician, researcher), and several definitions are available in the literature; definitions not always overlapping. However, the two main aspects on which there is ample agreement is that constipation is characterized by a reduction (up to absence) of bowel movements and/or frequent (conventionally defined as at least a quarter of the occasions) difficult expulsion of stools (straining at stools) [1]. It is worth noting that these two aspects also broadly define the two main subtypes of chronic constipation, represented by slow-transit constipation (STC) and obstructed defecation (OD) [1].",

      "abstract": "Hunger und andere Formen der Mangelernahrung konnen verschiedene Konsequenzen fur den Organismus nach sich ziehen, wie zum Beispiel eine Herzinsuffizienz, eine Fettleber, Formen der Protein-Energie-Malnutrition wie Kwashiorkor und Marasmus und schlimmstenfalls den Tod. Bisher weniger grundlich untersucht sind die Folgen extremer Unterernahrung fur die Psyche. Menschen, die unter Hunger leiden, wirken antriebs- und kraftlos und lethargisch. Man konnte vermuten, dass sie depressiv sind. Aber erfullen sie wirklich die Diagnosekriterien einer klinischen Depression? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage konnte wichtige Hinweise darauf bergen, welche langfristigen Konsequenzen etwa auf eine Hungersnot oder ein weiteres Ansteigen der Pravalenz der Anorexia Nervosa folgen konnten. Dies konnte sowohl relevant fur die Arbeit von Arzten, Oecotrophologen, Psychologen und anderen therapeutischen Berufsgruppen sein als auch, auf einer globalen Ebene, bedeutsame Informationen fur die okonomischen Folgen beinhalten, die auf eine von Mangelernahrung betroffene Gesellschaft zukommen. So konnte eine durch Hunger induzierte erhohte Depressionspravalenz weitere Kosten fur das wahrscheinlich ohnehin gebeutelte Gesundheitssystem eines betroffenen Staats nach sich ziehen. Zudem ist es fur Menschen, die zusatzlich zu den korperlichen Entbehrungen des Hungers unter Symptomen der Antriebslosigkeit, Hoffnungslosigkeit, Interesse- und Freudlosigkeit leiden, um einiges schwerer, Kraft und Motivation fur den Wiederaufbau eines Landes zu finden. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschaftigt sich daher damit, ob Mangelernahrung zum Entstehen einer Depression fuhrt und welcher Art die gefundenen Symptome sind. Mangelernahrung ist ein weltweit verbreitetes Phanomen, das verschiedene Ursachen haben kann. Wahrend Hunger ein groses Problem in armeren Landern darstellt, entwickeln vor allem in den industrialisierten Landern immer mehr Menschen Essstorungen. Die in dieser Arbeit formulierten Hypothesen wurden anhand einer Zusammenfassung der Literatur und der wichtigsten Studien uberpruft. Es wurde gefunden, dass Mangelernahrung nicht zu einer klinisch diagnostizierbaren Depression, aber dennoch zu ausgepragten depressiven Symptomen fuhrt, die sich nach einer Normalisierung der Nahrungsaufnahme zuruckbilden. Diese Auswirkungen beschranken sich nicht auf einen somatischen Symptombereich, sondern finden sich ebenso in psychischen und kognitiven Gebieten. Weitere insbesondere experimentelle Forschungsarbeiten zur Kontrolle dieser Ergebnisse waren wertvoll fur die Weiterentwicklung des Verstandnisses der Interaktion von Mangelernahrung und Symptomen psychischer Erkrankungen.",

      "abstract": "Patients with acute or chronic ischemic heart disease have a high incidence of depression, and a variable proportion of patients (ranging from 14% to 47%) suffer from major or subclinical depression. In addition, chronic depression has been shown to be associated with the development or progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Besides a poor quality of life, depressive symptoms in patients with ischemic heart disease result in a poor prognosis, as cardiovascular event rates are 2-2.5 times higher than in their counterparts without depressive symptoms. A variety of pathogenetic mechanisms may play a role, including pathophysiological (dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, platelet hyperaggregability, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and genetic predisposition) and behavioral mechanisms (inadequate therapy adherence, obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle). However, in patients with ischemic heart disease, depression often goes undiagnosed or untreated. Several screening procedures including questionnaires for patients with heart disease, along with the help of a psychiatrist, may facilitate not only the diagnosis of depressive symptoms but also the pharmacological and/or physiotherapeutic management. The use of tricyclic antidepressant agents should be avoided in patients with heart disease, whereas selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be safe in this patient population. However, no evidence is available to support that use of these drugs is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events at follow-up. Psychotherapy proved to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms but ineffective in improving prognosis. In this review, epidemiology and pathophysiology of depression in patients with ischemic heart disease are described, with a focus on stratification of depressive symptoms and potential therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

In addition, children with ADHD are at increased risk for developing alcoholism and other drug addictions, especially if alcoholism or ADHD exists in other family members. Alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse may develop earlier in life (i.e., in midadolescence) when ADHD is accompanied by certain behavioral or mood disorders. The nature of the link between ADHD and AOD use disorder is unknown, although the association may be mediated by the co-occurring disorders just mentioned. In addition, ADHD-related AOD abuse may develop initially as an attempt to alleviate symptoms of mental distress associated with chronic failure, feelings of inadequacy, and conflict with parents and peers.

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

En la anestesiología hay mayor riesgo de dependencia a opioides e hipnóticos que en otras especialidades y puede llegar a afectar al 1% de los médicos anestesiólogos. La fisiopatología del trastorno por uso de sustancias tiene hechos comunes para diferentes drogas. Interactúan la vulnerabilidad genética y factores psicosociales como predisponentes y los efectos psicobiológicos de la sustancia como factor gatillante. En el caso de los anestesiólogos, la sustancia se encuentra en el lugar de trabajo y por lo tanto, el individuo está constantemente expuesto. Una disfunción previa del sistema de recompensa en el circuito mesocorticolímbico o causada por la exposición a la sustancia adictiva es la piedra central de la neurobiología de las adicciones. Los opioides, anfetaminas, canabinoides, alcohol y nicotina, son algunas de las sustancias exógenas que activan el circuito y causan inicialmente un efecto hedónico que reforzará la conducta por repetir la experiencia. Con el tiempo la interacción con la droga será para evitar los síntomas de abstinencia. Dada la exposición laboral de los anestesiólogos, es necesario prevenir, detectar y tratar precozmente a quienes están abusando de sustancias durante su ejercicio profesional. Por las características de estos fármacos, aspectos psicológicos especiales de los médicos y el contexto laboral se hace necesario un tratamiento especializado y en anestesiólogos la reinserción laboral debe ser un proceso controlado, gradual y con un seguimiento prolongado. Prescription drugs dependence seriously impairs doctors from differents fields of medicine. Anesthesiology has greater risk than other specialties to opioids and hypnotics dependence, with prevalence up to 1%. Substances use disorder has common mechanisms of disease regardless which drug has been abused. There are interactions between genetic vulnerability and psychosocial facts as a risk factor and psychobiological effects of the substance as a triggering factor. Anesthesiologists use addictive substances in their patients at work everyday, therefore individual is constantly exposed. Previous reward dysfunction or triggered by drugs exposure on mesocorticolimbic circuit is central stone of the neurobiology of addictions. Opioids, amphetamines, cannabinoids, alcohol and nicotine, are exogenous agents whose activates the reward circuit generating a hedonic effect that reinforces drug-seeking behavior. Meanwhile a rising tolerance ocurs and positive reinforcement decreases. Finally substance will be used to avoid withdrawal. Because anesthesiologists are occupationally exposed, it is necessary to reduce risk by preventing strategies and early detection who are abusing substances in a professional frame. Because drugs characteristics and physicians psychological aspects a specialized treatment team is required and reentry to labor should be in a controlled and long follow-up.",

Unless contraindicated, prophylaxis with a gastrointestinal motility stimulant laxative and a stool softener is appropriate in terminally ill patients who are being given opioids. Patients with low performance status are not candidates for surgical treatment of bowel obstruction. Cramping abdominal pain associated with mechanical bowel obstruction often can be managed with morphine (titrating the dosage for pain) and octreotide. Delirium is common at the end of life and is frequently caused by a combination of medications, dehydration, infections or hypoxia. Haloperidol is the pharmaceutical agent of choice for the management of delirium. Dyspnea, the subjective sensation of uncomfortable breathing, is often treated by titration of an opioid to relieve the symptom; a benzodiazepine is used when anxiety is a component of the breathlessness.",

Recent cognitive theories suggest that optimal information processing related to the capacity to make decisions under uncertainty conditions is impaired either prior to the initiation of alcohol use, or it is related to the consequence of its repeated utilization. In this paper, we suggest that alcoholism may be the product of an imbalance between two separate, but interacting, cognitive registers that contribute to decision making: a reactive/automatic attentional and memory system for signaling the presence of alcohol cues in the environment and for attributing to such cues pleasure and/or excitement; and a reflective/nonautomatic system for regulating the dominant reactive/automatic response. Hyperactivity within the reactive system can override the reflective system and brain/cognitive changes induced by ethanol could lead to the disruption of self-regulation. We finally develop the idea that different patterns of imbalance between reactive and reflective systems could lead to distinct patterns of clinical impulsivity involved in the vulnerability to, the development of, and the relapse into alcoholism.",

The outcome of patients followed-up for at least 5 years was also reviewed.Ten children were studied: two with type I (Gastaut) COE, six with type II (Panayiotopoulos) COE, and two with intermediate forms of the disorder. Patients with type I COE suffered daytime seizures with visual symptoms (hallucinations and amaurosis) followed by versive motor partial complex seizures with secondary generalized seizures. Age of onset was late childhood and the seizures reappeared in adolescence when therapy was discontinued. Patients with type II COE had nocturnal seizures consisting of tonic deviation of the head and eyes, some degree of disturbance of consciousness and hypotony followed by vomiting and hemiclonic movements or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In five children, the first presenting symptom was status epilepticus. In all patients the age of onset was between 1 and 4 years. The results of neuroimaging studies were normal. EEG records showed normal baseline activity with slow wave spikes in the occipital region that disappeared or were reduced by eye opening.Our clinical and EEG findings are similar to those of other published studies. Type II COE frequently presents as status epilepticus and can be confused with other neurologic emergencies. Ictal EEG is useful to clarify the diagnosis. In type II COE, ictal symptomatology may overlap with migraine with aura. Although designated benign, patients with type I COE may develop learning problems and continue to have seizures throughout childhood.",

In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Background:Olanzapine is a highly tolerable and easily affordable atypical antipsychotic drug which has been commonly prescribed in both inpatient and outpatient settings for several mental disorders. Olanzapine overdose is commonly seen in psychiatric patients, who attempt suicide by intoxicating themselves with their own prescribed medications. Increased olanzapine use is associated with increased incidence of overdosing. Case Presentation:We are reporting a case of olanzapine overdosage as a cause of pinpoint pupils and altered sensorium with exclusion of other differentials. The mainstay of managementof olanzapine overdose is general supportive and symptomatic measures. Discussion: Pinpoint pupils with altered sensorium and agitation are always an alarming situation for a clinician, because of differentials like organophosphorus poisoning, pontine hemorrhage and opium overdosing. Due to olanzapine overdosage, similar clinical picture can be confusing in the emergency department and early identification of such cases is helpful to decrease the risk of fatality. Conclusion: This case highlights the significance of olanzapine overdosing as a differential diagnosis for patients presented with altered sensorium and pinpoint pupils in the emergency department. Olanzapine overdosage is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although there is no specific antidote for olanzapine overdose, appropriate history, assessment and early diagnosis are very useful for the better outcome.",

      "abstract": "Pica is a symptom not a disease, manifested by the persistent and compulsive eating of non-nutritious substances like ice, soil, clay, chalk, soap and stool, or nutritious substances such as ice (pagophagia), starch (amilophagia), potato, rice and coffee, among others, with unrestrained binge. The most common forms of pica are geophagia or soil consumption and pagophagia or ice consumption. Similar to other medical symptoms such as fever and anemia, pica is a symptom caused by multiple factors, being iron and zinc deficiencies the most frequent associations, where the physician, rather than treat it, must identify the intimate cause which is associated with, and correct it, as is possible in most cases of pica. Pica, despite being a symptom, according to the type and intensity, can cause morbidity and mortality. Among the complications associated with pica are electrolyte disorders, obstruction and damage of the digestive tract by some types of pica, such as geophagy and trichophagia, and pica of foreign objects such as plastics and velcro. Its diagnosis, which only consists in questioning this practice to patients or their caregivers, in the case of children and patients with mental illness, is usually ignored in the care of patients, most likely due to ignorance of the health team about this disorder, or lack of time during the medical consultation. The aim of this module is to call attention to this cardinal clinical sign, so that latent problems can be identified early, even before the underlying disease manifests or the complications associated with it.",

Symptoms consist in the compulsion to move the lower limbs caused by unspecified unpleasant sensations. This disorder is difficult to diagnose because it imitates other diseases. For this reason, differential diagnosis plays a large role in diagnosis. In the case of a slight exacerbation of symptoms, non-pharmacological activities are used, such as improving the conditions of falling asleep, avoiding intense work at the computer just before bedtime, stimulants (coffee, strong tea), energy drinks. Pharmacological treatment should be introduced if the symptoms are more severe. Pharmacotherapy depends on the nature of the symptoms. In the recurrent form, the drug of choice is the lowest effective dose of levodopa. In chronic forms, we permanently use drugs from the group of dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) or so-called gabapentinoid (gabapentin, pregabalin).",

      "title": "SUPPRESSION OF TENEURIN-4 IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS ALLEVIATES METHAMPHETAMINE-INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE AND BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS IN MICE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background According to the World Drug Report 2022 from United Nations, amphetamine-type stimulants take third place in worldwide drug addiction, primary methamphetamine (METH) [1]. And over 30,0000 people died from drug overdoses induced by stimulants combined with other drugs [2]. METH is recognized as a widely distributed psychostimulant with a strong addictive potential that impacts the central nervous system and body health [3]. METH predominantly exerts its influence on the limbic system through the stimulation of the release of various neurotransmitters, including dopamine, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical element of the brain's reward circuitry. Both short-term and prolonged METH use can result in lasting physical and mental health complications, some of which may endure indefinitely. Over the last decades, significant social problems associated with METH have gotten worse over the past few decades, especially after COVID-19 [1, 2]. Aim &amp; Objectives Our previous data revealed several genes associated with METH, including Odz4 gene. The Odz4 gene encodes teneurin-4 (TENM4) protein which belongs to one subtype of type II transmembrane teneurin proteins (TENM1-4) [4]. Genetic studies have indicated a correlation between teneurin proteins and developmental issues, neurological disorders, and drug residence [5]. Recently, some clinical research found that the Odz4 gene has an abnormal mutant in the brain of patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [6, 7]. Based on the aforementioned research, it is suggested that TENM4 might play a role in the progress of drug addiction. Here we investigated the performance of TENM4 knockdown in METH-induced dopamine release of NAc shell and behavior alterations in mice. Method We administered METH or saline subcutaneously to mice for six consecutive days. Two hours after the final injection of METH, we sacrificed all mice and preserved them under 80°. Then we investigated the changes in Odz4 mRNA and protein levels using RT-qPCR and WB, respectively. Subsequently, we injected AAV-carrying Odz4-targeting gRNA involved CRISPR-Cas system into the NAc After four weeks of the injection, we assessed the time response of dopamine in NAc by in vivo microdialysis and alteration of conditioned place preference induced by METH. Results We found a significant increase in Odz4 mRNA and TENM4 protein levels in the NAc region after continued METH administration. We confirmed the knockdown effect by AAV injection of the NAc of mice. The TENM4 knockdown exhibited an attenuated response of dopamine and place preference induced by METH. Discussion and Conclusion These results indicate the association between TENM4 and the pharmacological effects of METH in NAc region of mice. However, addiction behaviors affected by the knockdown of TENM4 and its specific mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear and require further investigation.

Although PBD has biological underpinnings, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental stressors can trigger or exacerbate depressive and manic symptoms. Thus, while pharmacotherapy is effective for controlling biological contributions to mood episodes, psychotherapy is also necessary to target psychosocial factors that may activate or worsen symptoms in PBD, and to address associated academic, interpersonal, and functional impairment.",

In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959). Disturbances may appear within six to seven hours of initial therapy (Goolker and Schein, 1953), after prolonged administration, or even after complete withdrawal of the hormone therapy.",

Recollection memory, attention, and visual information processing may be particularly impaired in patients with bipolar illness. Cognitive impairment appears to worsen with illness progression, and may have a significant impact on function. Pharmacotherapy to treat bipolar disorder including lithium, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics may have varying effects on cognitive functioning. Treatment with atypical antipsychotics has been associated with improvement in various cognitive measures in patients with schizophrenia, and the little data available in patients with bipolar disorder suggest the potential for similar benefits. Studies to determine if current treatments for bipolar disorder can prevent, delay, or even improve cognitive dysfunction are needed.",

      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

      "abstract": "Basic and Clinical Endocrinology Up-to-Date 136 Single benign sporadic insulinomas 2.1 Diagnosis of hypoglycaemia related to endogenous hyperinsulinism 2.1.1 Clinical symptoms of insulinomasThe clinical symptoms of insulinomas are heterogeneous and may differ among the patients.There is no specific clinical symptom.Hypoglycaemia results in autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms.Autonomic symptoms comprise adrenergic symptoms, such as palpitations and tremor, and cholinergic symptoms, with sweating, hunger, sometimes paresthesias.Neuroglycopenic symptoms comprise severe weakness, and many psychiatric and neurological manifestations, the most commonly reported being behavioural changes, confusion, agitation or slow reaction patterns, blurred vision, and finally seizures, transient loss of consciousness or hypoglycaemic coma.Hypoglycaemic coma is typically sudden, with agitation, sometimes pyramidal signs, and hypothermia; it may be profound and prolonged and therefore may be a cause of neurologic and cognitive sequelae and may occasionally lead to brain death.The combination of autonomic and moderate neuroglycopenic symptoms strongly suggests the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia.However, in insulinoma patients, autonomic symptoms may often be lacking.Neuroglycopenic symptoms are more specific of hypoglycemia related to insulinoma, but may be mild, or more often misleading.Therefore measurement of plasma glucose concentrations should be recommended in all patients with such symptoms, either in a patient without any known neurological or psychiatric disorder, or in a patient in whom such disorder had been previously controlled.Hypoglycaemic spells typically occur suddenly after a period of fast, several hours after the last meal, or after physical exercise.Some of them have been reported to occur within the hours following a meal or without any relationship with meal time, so that symptoms occurring in non fasting patients cannot rule out the diagnosis of insulinoma.In a series of 214 insulinoma patients with a reliable clinical history, symptoms of hypoglycaemia were reported exclusively in the fasting state in 73%, postprandial state in 6%, and both fasting and postprandial state in 21% (Placzkowski et al. 2009).Weight gain is found only in 25% of patients.Rapid (or rarely delayed) resolution of symptoms after glucose administration is part of Whipple's triad, which makes the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia when it has been assessed reliably; the triad comprises clinical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, the finding of a low plasma glucose concentration at the time of clinical symptoms, and subsiding of clinical symptoms after glucose administration.In rare pregnant patients with insulinoma, symptoms may resemble those of emesis in early pregnancy and may subside in late pregnancy as a consequence of insulin resistance, then are unmasked after delivery (Diaz et al. 2008), as reported in a patient who presented with coma and clonic seizures 14 hours after delivery (Christiansen & Vestergaard 2008). Biological diagnosis of insulinomas Plasma glucose concentrationsSince the clinical symptoms lack diagnostic specificity, measurement of plasma concentration of glucose is mandatory (ideally at the time of occurrence of clinical symptoms) and must be performed in venous blood samples with a reliable laboratory method.In order to avoid pseudohypoglycaemia, i.e. a consequence of glucose metabolism by blood cells in the tube containing the blood sample, the blood sample should be collected in a tube with a glycolysis inhibitor (NaF).Glucose concentrations are measured using reference method with hexokinase.",

      "title": "IMIPRAMINE INDUCED ACUTE DYSTONIA IN A CHILD WITH ENURESIS NOCTURNA",
      "abstract": "It is well known that some drugs and neurodegenerative processes, such asParkinson’s disease, can cause extrapyramidal side effects (1). Extrapyramidal symptoms (ES) may be drug-induced and due affect tolerance and compliance (2). ES includes akathisia, parkinsonian symptoms (e.g. tremor, bradykinesia and muscle rigidity) and impaired involuntary movements (e.g. acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesia) (3). Especially, antipsychotic drugs therapy (4), antiemetics, and a variety of other drugs (5) can frequently cause severe occurrences and complications (4). Some drugs induced ES are thought to causean imbalance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the nigrostriatal pathway(1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine and doxepine, may have antidopaminergic effect(2). However, antidepressant drugs are not directly acting as dopamine antagonists(6), but some movement disorders symptoms are rarely described as a side effect of tricyclic antidepressants(2). Enuresis nocturna is a multidisciplinary problem worked on by such many physicians as pediatricians, urologists and child and adolescent psychiatrists (7) can cause a significant psychosocial problem for children and their parents (8), which is estimated at 3.8% to 25% (9). That is, there are over 50 million children with enuresis around the world (10). Theaetiology of this condition is not totally known. Medical therapies including imipramine, desmopressin and anticholinergics, behavioural therapy and enuretic alarm devices are proposed to manage this condition(8). TCAs drugs are widely used in the process of managing this condition (11), for instance, Imipramine can reduce wetting in some children and young people (12).Unsal et al. Here we report a case of imipramine induced acute dystonia in an enuretic child. 8- year-old boy with severe torticollis was assessed in our outpatient clinic and. Beforehand, he had been diagnosed as enuresis nocturna by a child psychiatrist and was given imipramine 10 mg/day for treatment. After three days initiating imipramine 10 mg/day, he had severe muscular spasm on his neck. He had no psychiatric and neurological history. Physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistries, blood counts were within normal limits. He wasonly taking imipramine, and no other medication had been used during this three days. He was diagnosed with imipramine induced dystonia and biperiden 5 mg was administered intramusculary. After 45 minutes, it was seen that torticollis was resolved and he was referred to child psychiatry for the treatment of enuresis nocturna.",

      "abstract": "A psychological illness where people dread losing their connection to their mobile phones is known as nomophobia, or NO mobile phone phobia. Based on definitions from the DSM-IV, the term \"nomophobia\" refers to a \"phobia for a particular or specific things.\" When someone uses their phone excessively, there are a number of psychological issues at play, such as low self-esteem and an outgoing personality. The weight of this issue is currently growing on a global scale. NOMOPHOBIC symptoms may also be triggered by other mental illnesses, such as panic disorder, social anxiety, or social phobia. It is very difficult to tell if a patient develops NOMOPHOBIC symptoms as a result of an addiction to cell phones or if their anxiety issues are present [1]. Instances of nomophobia include the following signs and symptoms: tachycardia, anxiety, shaking, sweating, agitation, and altered breathing patterns. Nomophobia can also serve as a stand-in for other mental illnesses. As such, we must exercise extreme caution while diagnosing it. Nomophobia can also be triggered by certain mental illnesses, and vice versa. Because nomophobia shares clinical symptoms with other diseases, it can be extremely tough for clinicians to diagnose and treat patients due to its complexity [2].",

Where no organic cause can be discovered the condition is called Ménière’s disease. The syndrome is found in patients with bone disease involving the otic capsule such as otosclerosis, osteitis deformans or late syphilis. It may also follow labyrinthine trauma or be associated with a wide variety of diseases interfering with the blood supply to the brainstem or inner ear. Endolymphatic hydrops has been demonstrated in all these conditions, and it is believed that it may occur also in Ménière’s disease. Other causes of the syndrome include inflammatory or demyelinating disorders or tumours involving the eighth nerve. Many drugs have been used to treat Ménière’s disease, but with little success. Drugs investigated in recent years include cinnarizine (an antihistamine which has been used for vertigo and motion sickness), betahistine (an orally active histamine analogue) and hydrochlorothiazide.",

      "abstract": "1. Preliminary observation would indicate that Tofrānil is a useful drug in the treatment of depressive states. It is not a tranquilizer and, therefore, is of little value in other conditions. It is a promising drug which can be used as an anti-depressant. However, its indication and scope must be studied for a longer period to determine what symptoms respond best to it. 2. The effect of Tofrānil in many patients can be increased by the concomitant use of a tranquilizer or a stimulant. In a number of patients Tofrānil, by removing the depressive elements, frees and exaggerates anxiety. 3. It can be used in combination with electric shock or after electric shock as a maintenance dose. 4. It is of little value in the treatment of schizophrenics and in paranoid types may often aggravate the condition and break down an unstable equilibrium to which the patient has become adjusted. 5. The combined use of Tofrānil and a tranquilizer is helpful in certain psychoneurotic states, associated with anxiety or with reactive depressions. 6. It is of value in the treatment of depressions occurring in the older age group. 7. High doses are unnecessary and the effective range is somewhere between 75 and 150 mgm. per day. 8. For the most part, side effects are minimal, particularly in the younger age group. As one approaches the older age group, the frequency of such side effects increases, but usually they are more uncomfortable than serious. In patients over 60 there may be a tendency to sudden falls which occur without warning. It is recommended that in older patients the dosage be limited to 75 mgm. or less. 9. Side effects can usually be reduced in frequency or intensity by a reduction in the dosage. 10. Long-term use of the drug is apparently necessary as patients may relapse, at least in the early stages when the drug is prematurely removed. Since the drug is rapidly excreted, it is necessary to give the medication 3 times a day.",

More commonly, acute episodes of cannabis induced-psychosis manifest immediately following exposure, are precipitated after the use of large amounts of cannabis, resolve with abstinence, and are of shorter duration than those observed with primary psychotic disorders. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually manifest when heavy, prolonged consumption of this substance is interrupted or significantly reduced. The withdrawal syndrome may include sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and reduced appetite. On the other hand, cases of psychosis induced by cannabis withdrawal are rare. In this case, we present a 32-year-old healthy woman without personal or family psychiatric history who showed a heavy and continued consumption of cannabis since she was 10 years old, without developing any psychiatric symptoms. However, recently she experienced two brief psychotic episodes with disorganized behavior and persecutory delusions, both episodes happening a week after discontinuing cannabis consumption.",

      "title": "Clinically relevant differences among the opioid analgesics",
      "abstract": "The mechanism of action of opioids and clinically relevant differences among the opioid analgesics are described. Both endorphins (endogenous morphine-like substances) and exogenous opioids (opium alkaloids and their derivatives) bind to opioid receptors in the human central nervous system to provide analgesia and other effects. Some drugs, such as morphine, are true agonists, i.e., they bind to and activate receptors. Some are partial agonists, binding to part of the receptor and causing effects that are similar to, but perhaps less pronounced than, the effects produced by agonists. Others are antagonist, i.e., they bind to the receptor but do not cause the associated effects. Some drugs, termed agonist-antagonist opioids, act as antagonists at one type of receptor and agonists at another type of receptor. True agonists tend to have relatively straight-line dose-response curves; in other words, their effect increases with increasing doses over a broad dosage range. Partial agonists and agonist-antagonists tend to have ceiling effects; that is, they do not have the broad dosage range of drugs such as morphine, methadone, hydromorphone, and other \"strong\" opioids. This fact mediates against the use of partial agonists and agonist-antagonists in cancer patients who have chronic pain that may increase as the disease progresses. Three major factors that should be considered when a drug is selected for clinical use are (1) relative affinities for the different opioid receptor types, (2) pharmacokinetic characteristics that influence onset and duration of action, and (3) whether the opioids are strong or weak. For treatment of cancer pain, drugs with long durations of action are preferable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Schizophrenia in Late Life: Findings Challenge Traditional Concepts",
      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados. Conclusión: las APP son un grupo de trastornos neurocognitivos cuya característica primordial es el compromiso en el lenguaje, cada variante de APP tiene unas características clínicas y criterios diagnósticos específicos que se deben conocer para lograr sospechar el diagnóstico y hacer un abordaje apropiado en el paciente.",

      "abstract": "When a patient taking an antipsychotic is not experiencing symptomatic remission, or is experiencing adverse effects (AEs) that are intolerable or damaging to his or her physical health, a change in medication may be the best path to a good outcome. However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications in all but the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles. Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the \"withdrawal triad,\" comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element has been observed consistent with an activation syndrome. This activation syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or as a consequence of initial prodopaminergic drive. All of these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.",

      "title": "Medicaments and oral healthcare 4. Pharmacotherapy in (frail and care dependent) older people",
      "abstract": "Polypharmacy is the consequence of multimorbidity. Both phenomena may cause functional limitations and/or frailty and/or care dependency in older people. In the human body, a medicament undergoes at least 3 important actions: absorption, distribution and elimination. These actions may proceed aberrantly in older people. Following interaction with receptors, a medicament triggers a chain reaction in the human body. The receptors and each link of the chain reaction may be subject to changes due to diseases as well as ageing. This, particularly, is the case with regard to medications directed towards the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, interactions may occur between various medications mutually and between medications on the one hand and on the other hand food and water intake, self-medication with herbs, and diseases. Moreover, older people usually experience more adverse effects of medications when compared to younger people. This is due to altered body actions and reactions, polypharmacy and the many possible interactions. In older people, utilisation and intake of medications often give rise to problems that can be divided into medicament-related, patient-related, care- and care provider-related and other problems.Polyfarmacie is het gevolg van multimorbiditeit. Beide kunnen leiden tot kwetsbaarheid, functiebeperking en/of zorgafhankelijkheid bij ouderen. Een medicament ondergaat in het lichaam minimaal 3 belangrijke processen: absorptie, distributie en eliminatie. Bij ouderen kunnen deze processen afwijkend verlopen. Een medicament zet in het lichaam een kettingreactie in gang na interactie met receptoren. De receptoren en elk onderdeel van de kettingreactie kunnen door ziekten en veroudering veranderingen ondergaan. Dit speelt vooral bij medicamenten die werken op het centrale zenuwstelsel en het cardiovasculaire systeem. Daarnaast kunnen interacties optreden tussen verschillende medicamenten onderling en tussen enerzijds medicamenten en anderzijds voedsel- en waterinname, zelfmedicatie met kruiden en ziekten. Voorts ervaren ouderen doorgaans meer bijwerkingen van medicamenten dan jongeren. Dit komt door de gewijzigde lichaamsacties en -reacties, de polyfarmacie en de vele mogelijke interacties. Gebruik en inname van medicamenten leidt bij ouderen vaak tot problemen die te verdelen zijn in medicamentgerelateerde, patiëntgerelateerde, zorg(verlener)gerelateerde en overige problemen.",

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms.

It (nearsightedness) is a refractive error, a condition in which the cornea and lens of the non-accommodating eye have too much plus power for the length of the eye. As a result, images of distant objects are focused in front of the retina and thus appear blurred. Transient drug-induced myopia is a myopia induced by a drug as a transient side effect. Several case reports of transient drug-induced myopia have been reported. An adverse drug reaction is an expression that describes harm associated with the use of a given medication at a normal dosage during normal use. These cases have been associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma and other ocular conditions such as choroidal detachment, maculopathy, and retinal folds. Drugs known to produce this effect include sulfa drugs and other medications. The possible mechanism is thought to be an allergic reaction to the drug. Both ciliary muscle contraction and ciliary body edema may play a role in the Patho mechanism. Differential diagnosis is made with a number of conditions, either ocular in origin or associated with an underlying systemic cause. Discontinuation of medications leads to complete resolution of the anatomic shift.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Many patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute intoxication, serious complication of overdose, or withdrawal symptoms of illicit drugs. An acute withdrawal of drugs with addiction potential is associated with a sympathetic overactivity leading to marked psychomimetic disturbances. Acute intoxication or withdrawal of such drugs is often associated with life-threatening complications which require ICU admission and necessitate prolonged sedative analgesic medications, weaning from which is often complicated by withdrawal and other psychomimetic symptoms. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 (α(2)) agonist, has been used successfully to facilitate withdrawal and detoxification of various drugs and also to control delirium in ICU patients. Herein, we report a case of a chronic opioid abuse (heroin) patient admitted with acute overdose complications leading to a prolonged ICU course requiring sedative-analgesic medication; the drug withdrawal-related symptoms further complicated the weaning process. Dexmedetomidine infusion was successfully used as a sedative-analgesic to control the withdrawal-related psychomimetic symptoms and to facilitate smooth detoxification and weaning from opioid and other sedatives.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine’s behavioural and pharmacological eff ects can be studied directly, especially in animals. Compared with research in other mental disorders such as depression, in which the underlying disease mechanism can only be assumed from conceptual models, neuroscientifi c advances in the study of addictions are, arguably, at the fore in psychiatric research. Yet, unlike those other mental disorders, there is no drug treatment—let alone a cure— for cocaine dependence. Some possibilities are, however, emerging for the treatment of cocaine dependence when it accompanies opioid dependence (ie, speedballing). Cocaine abuse in opioid-dependent individuals is common. 42% of opioid addicts entering methadone treatment also abuse cocaine, and at 1-year follow-up this pattern persists in 22% of individuals. 1 Opioid addicts abusing cocaine have increased propensity not only for continued illicit drug use but also for sequelae, such as higher risk for HIV infection, interpersonal discord, and criminality. Opioid addicts benefi t from treatment with either opioid agonists (eg, methadone or levacetylmethadol), partial agonists (eg, buprenorphine), or the combination of a partial agonist and antagonist (eg, buprenorphine and naloxone). Cocaine use by opioid-abusing cocaine addicts can also be suppressed by high-dose methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment. 2",

      "title": "Opioid and Common Co-Ingestant Antidotes",
      "abstract": "OPIOID OVERDOSE AND TREATMENTIntroductionAll compounds related to opium are referred to as opioids. Opioids are available alone or in combination with other agents such as APAP. They have both analgesic and central nervous system (CNS) effects, with the potential to cause both euphoria and respiratory depression. Dependence and tolerance can develop to opioids. Dependence occurs due to changes in the locus ceruleus (LC). Norepinephrine is created in the LC and is attributed with stimulating wakefulness, breathing, blood pressure, and alertness. When opioids bind to mu receptors in the LC, norepinephrine release is suppressed. With repeated exposure to opioids, neurons in the LC modify their response and become hyperactive, offsetting the suppressive effects of opioids. If opioids are absent after this accommodation has been made, excessive amounts of norepinephrine are released resulting in withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, muscle cramps, diarrhea, and psychomotor agitation [1]. As a result of all these factors, there is a risk for overdosing on opioids. An opioid overdose is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment including the opioid antagonist naloxone.PrevalenceFrom 1999 to 2013 in the United States, drug poisoning deaths have more than doubled from 6.1 to 13.8 per 100,000 persons [2]. Whereas, drug poisoning deaths involving opioid analgesics have nearly quadrupled from 1.4 to 5.1 per 100,000. (Figure 1) In 2013, 43,982 drug overdose deaths were reported [3]. Prescription opioids account for 16,235 (37%) of these deaths, and 8,257 (19%) were from heroin. (Table 1) These statistics may underestimate the true burden of opioid overdose deaths as 22% of fatal poisoning records did not provide information on the involved drug [4]. The same year men were nearly four times more likely than women to die from a heroin-related drug-poisoning (6,525 versus 1,732 deaths, respectively), occurring most commonly between the ages of 25 and 44. In 2013, Non- Hispanic white persons aged 18-44 had the highest rate of drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin with 7 per 100,000. This is a drastic change from the year 2000 when non-Hispanic black persons aged 45-64 had the highest rate for drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin with 2.0 per 100,000 [4].Common Co-IngestantsIn 2013, poison control centers in the United States reported 20,135 exposures to pure opioids resulting in 778 cases of major toxicity and 84 deaths. There were also 17,290 exposures to combinations of opioids with APAP, aspirin, or ibuprofen, with 308 cases of major toxicity and 52 deaths [6]. The use of opioids with BZDs has drastically increased. Thus, making knowledge of antidotes for opioids, APAP, and BZDs extremely beneficial [7].Risk FactorsThere are numerous factors associated with increased risk of opioid overdose, the first of which is increased availability of prescription and illicit opioids [8]. In the United States, there is a direct relationship between the number of opioid prescriptions, the dose prescribed, and overdoses [9]. Whereas, a decrease in the availability of heroin has been linked to a reduction in overdoses [8]. Another overdose risk factor is combining opioids with other substances. Both alcohol and BZDs are sedatives that effect GABA receptors in the CNS [10]. Respiration is mediated by GABA receptors and opioid receptors; therefore, the combination of opioids with alcohol or BZDs causes more potent respiratory depression than either alone [10]. Cocaine co-ingestion can also increase risk of opioid overdose. This is postulated to be due to impaired breathing associated with smoking crack or the onset of acute hypertension from the use of cocaine at the time of an opioid overdose [11]. Recent abstinence from opioid use including time spent in rehabilitation treatment programs or incarcerated also increases the risk of overdose [12].Mechanism of ToxicityThe term toxidrome was first used in 1970 to describe a syndrome caused by dangerous levels of toxins [13]. …",

      "title": "Behavioural Effects of Anti‐epileptic Drugs",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY There is increasing evidence that various types of behavioural disturbance, other than those described for phenytoin, for example, may occur from the use of anti‐epileptic medication, and it has been suggested that these disturbances may not always be reversible. There are suspicions also that certain groups of patients—especially those with structural brain damage—are particularly susceptible. These and other factors relevant to the study of the effects of anti‐epileptic drugs on behaviour are comprehensively reviewed. It is concluded that the psycho‐pharmacology of anti‐epileptic drugs is unsatisfactory at present because of inadequate and unsophisticated reporting of behavioural change and because of the common problem of polypharmacy, and that more accurate observations are needed on less heterogeneous groups of patients than have been described in the past. RÉSUMÉ Effets des medications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement Il devient de plus en plus évident que des types variés de troubles du comportement, autres que ceux traditionnellement attribués à la phénytoïne, par exemple, peuvent suivre l'emploi de medication anti‐épileptique; il a même été suggéré que ces troubles ne sont pas toujours réversibles. Certaines indications laissent à penser que certains groupes de malades, notamment ceux qui présentent des troubles cérébraux structuraux, sont particulièrement sensibles. Ces faits et les autres facteurs relevant d'une étude de l'action des médications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement sont systématiquement analysés. L'auteur concluent qu'à l'heure actuelle la psychopharmacologie des médications anti‐épileptiques n'est pas satisfaisante en raison de rapports inadéquats et non qualifiés sur les troubles du comportement ainsi que sur le problème commun des associations médicamenteures. Il est indispensable de disposer d'observations plus précises, de groupes de malades moins hétérogènes que ce qui a été fait dans le passé. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verhaltenseinflüsse von Antiepileptika Es gibt zunehmend Hinweise darauf, daß verschiedene Arten von Verhaltensstörungen, andere als die zum Beispiel traditionell vom Diphenylhydantoin beschriebenen, bei der Anwendung von Antiepileptika auftreten können; es wurde vermutet, daß die Störungen nicht in alien Fällen reversibel sein könnten. Es gibt weiterhin Vermutungen, daß eine bestimmte Gruppe von Patienten—besonders solche mit strukturellen Hirnschädigungen—im besonderen dafür empfänglich sind. Es wird eine umfassende Übersicht dieser und anderer, für diese Studie der Effekte antikonvulsiver Medikamente auf das Verhalten relevanter Faktoren gegeben. Es wird festgestellt, daß die Psychopharmakologie der Antikonvulsiva zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt unzureichend ist, da adäquate und sorgfältige Berichte über Verhaltensanderungen und die allgemeinen Probleme der Polypharmazie fehlen; es werden genauere Beobachtungen an weniger heterogenen Patientengruppen benötigt, als sie bisher beschrieben sind. RESUMEN Efectos sobre la conducta de los fármacos antiepilépticos Hay una evidencia creciente de que diversos tipos de alteraciones en el comportamiento, además de los ya tradicionalmente descritos para la fenitoína por ejemplo, pueden aparecer por el uso de medicación antiepiléptica, y se ha sugerido que estas alteraciones no siempre pueden ser reversibles. Hay sospechas también de que algunos grupos de pacientes, especialmente aquellos con lesión estructural cerebral, sen particularmente susceptibles. Se revisan de forma complet estos y otros factores en relación con el estudio de los efectos de los fármacos antiepilépticos sobre el comportamiento. Se concluye que la psicofarmacología de los fármacos antiepilépticos no es satisfactoria en el momento presente debido a unas comunicaciones inadecuadas o no sofisticadas sobre los cambios del comportamiento y el problema común de la polifarmacia, y que es necesaria una observación más atenta en grupos de pacientes menos heterogéneos de los que han sido descritos en el pasado.",

Cuando ambas patologías se dan en el mismo sujeto, las consecuencias de cara al pronóstico empeoran, especialmente por la repercusión del consumo de sustancias en una baja adherencia al tratamiento antipsicótico en este grupo de pacientes, lo que habitualmente predice recaídas psicóticas a medio plazo. El uso de fármacos agonistas opiodes, como la metadona, en el tratamiento de la dependencia a heroína es altamente frecuente, existiendo una amplia evidencia de su eficacia. Por otra parte, entre los síntomas de abstinencia aguda a opiodes se incluyen alteraciones afectivas como la disforia, y se han descrito serie de casos de psicosis tras la retirada de éstos. Se presenta el caso de un varón de 42 años, con diagnóstico de dependencia a heroína de varios años de evolución y Esquizofrenia Paranoide, que está en tratamiento sustitutivo con metadona y que, tras la retirada de este fármaco, presentó una reagudización de síntomas psicóticos que requirió ingreso hospitalario para estabilización clínica. Los pacientes duales con esquizofrenia se consideran especialmente graves, tanto desde la perspectiva psicopatológica como social. La aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras la desintoxicación de opioides en pacientes sin antecedentes conocidos ha sido descrita por varios autores, sugiriéndose que los opioides modulan la transmisión dopaminérgica en la fisiopatología de la psicosis. La desintoxicación de opioides y sus posibles complicaciones obliga a una adecuada vigilancia por parte de los profesionales. El periodo inmediatamente posterior a la desintoxicación de opioides puede considerarse como de alto riesgo de descompensación psicótica.",

Vitamin deficiencies can also cause memory loss (especially vitamin B12, B1, and D). Hormonal imbalances, particularly thyroid disorders, can mimic memory disorders. Memory problems can also come from bodily stress, infections, and diseases (including Lyme disease, COVID-19, encephalitis, diabetes, major surgeries and anesthesia, organ failure, and poor sleep). Many neurologic disorders can cause memory problems, particularly if the hippocampus, frontal lobes, or temporal lobes are involved. Neurologic disorders include brain tumors, epilepsy and seizures, multiple sclerosis, strokes, transient global amnesia, and traumatic brain injury. Psychiatric disorders can also cause memory problems, including anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disease, schizophrenia, electroconvulsive therapy, dissociative amnesia, and alcohol or drug use.",

Bolest spojenou s tepelným poškozením charakterizuje její komplexní charakter, tj. akutní, neuropatické, zánětlivé a nociceptivní vlastnosti. Jelikož bolest jako taková je spojena s celou řadou dalších negativních vjemů (zejména se strachem a úzkostí), vede nedostatečná kontrola bolestivých podnětů k poklesu \"compliance\" pacientů a může zavinit delší hojení s jasným dopadem na kvalitu života nemocného.

Ta může přesáhnout 5 a více měsíců. Během této doby se po opakovaném nebo kontinuálním podávání opioidů jejich účinnost výrazně snižuje. Jejich podávání je také zatíženo řadou nežádoucích účinků.

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J.

When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D.

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]. Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B.

The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J.

Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M.

Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar].

It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

Most are of obscure nature while some illustrate features of syncope that deserve further scrutiny. The cases are divided into six groups: 1) Resembling cardiac syncope (30 cases); 2) vasovagal syncope (22 cases); 3) features of both cardiac and vasovagal syncope (12 cases); 4) orthostatic hypotensive (29 cases); 5) akinetic seizure? (12 cases); and 6) miscellaneous (5 cases). Some groups are subdivided according to the circumstances surrounding the spells, for example, seated eating, nocturnal, associated with bowel movement, response to anticonvulsant therapy, etc. The following conclusions seem warranted: 1) The evidence favors the existence of a type of akinetic seizure resembling cardiac syncope; 2) loss of consciousness while seated eating (prandial syncope) may comprise a syndrome; 3) syncope related to bowel movement or abdominal pain is a striking association; 4)sporadic nocturnal syncope due to temporary hyp or e activity ofbaroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hy-poreactivity of baroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hypotension.

      "abstract": "Drug use may be the cause of a wide variety of different symptoms and disorders in children and many different mechanisms may be involved. A number of situations in childhood may predispose to the development of adverse reactions. In the country-wide \"voluntary reporting system\" for drug monitoring in the Netherlands, only a small percentage of 4.5 of the case reports concern children (14 years and younger). The reported experiences show that adverse reactions which are important in adults, e.g. blood dyscrasia, erythema multiforme and liver injury, may also be encountered in children. The predominance of physics reactions (e.g. agitation, hallucinations) in suspected relationship with a variety of drugs (sympathicomimetics, anticholinergics, antihistamines, oxolamine) and neurological effects (e.g. dyskinesia in association with metoclopramide or domperidone) suggest that the nervous system in childhood is susceptible to side effects of drugs; further study on this subject seems to be needed. Clinical trials in children are limited because of ethical considerations; as a consequence post-marketing surveillance should pay special attention to this vulnerable group of patients.

Here, the basic structure and function of the central auditory system will be highlighted as relevant to cases of permanent hearing loss where assistive devices (hearing aids) are called for. The parts of the brain used for hearing are altered in two basic ways in instances of hearing loss: (1) Damage to the ear can reduce the number and nature of input channels that the brainstem receives from the ear, causing plasticity of the central auditory system. This plasticity may partially compensate for the peripheral loss, or add new abnormalities such as distorted speech processing or tinnitus. (2) In some situations, damage to the brain can occur independently of the ear, as may occur in cases of head trauma, tumors or aging. Implications of deficits to the central auditory system for speech perception in noise, hearing aid use and future innovative circuit designs will be provided to set the stage for subsequent presentations in this special educational session.

      "title": "ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS USE IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS",
      "abstract": "Background. Classical antipsychotics – neuroleptics are one of the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs in child psychiatry. Atypical antipsychotics are used for the same indications – psychotic (schizophrenia) as well as unpsychotic disorders (pervasive developmental disorders, mood disorders, conduct disorders and tics disorders). It is surprising that the studies on their use with regard to this age group are rather rare. They are carried out on a small number of samples and only exceptionally double blind. This article summarizes published clinical experience with atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents. A short overview of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and side effects is given. Schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disorders are major indications for use of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents, but they have also been successfully used for other disorders such as aggressive behaviour, tics and anorexia nervosa. Conclusions. With better side-effect profile, some of the atypical antipsychotics are expected to be doctrinally recognised as the first-line treatment for childhood schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disorders. However, more long-term studies carried out on a larger sample are needed. Atypical antipsychotics are already used in everyday practice as first-line treatment of childhood and adolescents schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Is Akathisia a Frequent Side Effect of Neuroleptics in Patients with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder?",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: We observed extreme akathisia (restlessness) after general anesthesia that included premedication with neuroleptic drugs in a 13-yr-old boy and a 41-yr-old woman with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Subsequently, we asked the parents of 47 ADHD children who had undergone general anesthesia to report their experiences. Thirty-four parents reported that after anesthesia, especially with neuroleptic drugs like triflupromazine, their children experienced marked and worsening restlessness, hyperactivity, and aggressive behavior. Two patients who had received neuroleptic drugs tolerated a second anesthesia (ketamine and propofol with no neuroleptic premedication) without any problem. Most neuroleptic drugs are dopamine antagonists (1). It has been suggested that ADHD patients lack dopamine because of high dopamine transporter availability (2), a condition that stimulants like methylphenidate can correct (3). It is not surprising the neuroleptic drugs might exacerbate the reduced dopamine levels in ADHD patients, explaining the worsening of symptoms such as akathisia. To our knowledge this has not been formally studied. If others have observed that patients with ADHD frequently experience akathisia after receiving neuroleptic drugs, then controlled studies on the effect of neuroleptics and other anesthetic drugs in patients with ADHD would be of interest.

      "abstract": "Various factors contribute to a predisposition towards the excessive consumption of alcohol: socio-demographic factors, a disturbed family background or certain neurological disorders in childhood, a family background of heavy drinking or total abstinence, or a genetic predisposition towards the biochemical reactions of excessive drinking. Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

      "abstract": "La toxicité cérébrale du cannabis est marquée principalement par des effets cognitifs, addictifs et psychotomimétiques. Troubles cognitifs Plusieurs études ont montré que l’administration aiguë de Δ-9-THC, principal principe actif du cannabis, et que la consommation régulière de cannabis entraînaient des troubles de l’attention, de la mémoire, en particulier de la mémoire de travail et de la mémoire épisodique ainsi que des troubles des fonctions exécutives. Ces troubles ont un impact sur l’apprentissage, les acquisitions scolaires, la conduite d’un véhicule et les tâches complexes. Ils sont liés à la dose, à la fréquence, à la durée d’exposition et à l’âge de la première consommation. Ils peuvent disparaître après sevrage, mais des anomalies durables s’observent chez les sujets ayant débuté leur consommation avant l’âge de 15 ans. Effets addictifs La fréquence sur la vie entière de la dépendance au cannabis, caractérisée essentiellement par le craving , la perte de contrôle de la consommation et le retentissement important sur la vie familiale/professionnelle/sociale est, d’après certaines études, de 1 % en population générale. Le syndrome de sevrage, décrit en 2004, pourrait être inclus dans le DSM-5. Effets psychotomimétiques Fréquents, les symptômes psychotiques induits par la consommation de cannabis (idées de référence, de persécution) disparaissent spontanément dans les 24 heures. Ils durent parfois plusieurs semaines dans les pharmacopsychoses. Neuf études longitudinales ont montré que les sujets qui avaient fumé du cannabis avaient deux fois plus de risque environ que les sujets abstinents, de présenter ultérieurement des troubles psychotiques. Le risque, dose-dépendant, est plus élevé lorsque la consommation de cannabis a débuté avant l’âge de 15 ans et chez les sujets qui ont des antécédents familiaux de troubles psychotiques. L’évolution de la schizophrénie est aggravée par la consommation de cannabis. Toxicité cérébrale du cannabis Elle est liée à l’interaction du Δ-9-THC sur les récepteurs cannabinoïdes cérébraux CB1, localisés principalement dans l’hippocampe, le cervelet, le cortex frontal, le striatum et les ganglions de la base. Plusieurs études ont retrouvé que la consommation de cannabis pouvait interférer avec le système endocannabinoïde cérébral lors de la maturation du cerveau à l’adolescence. Elle favorise aussi des troubles vasculaires cérébraux. Les études d’imagerie cérébrale ont retrouvé que les effets du cannabis, modérés en cas d’usage simple, étaient marqués chez les consommateurs réguliers par une diminution dose-dépendante de la densité de substance grise au niveau de l’hippocampe, des régions parahippocampiques et de l’amygdale.",

      "title": "Acute Psychotic Episode in Psychostimulant Drug Addicted Teenager",
      "abstract": "Background: Consumption of psychostimulant drugs is a medical problem of the entire world because of the growing number of consumers, while developing global drug trafficking. The predisposition for psychostimulant drugs is primarily influenced by the psychological structure of the individual (persons instability, histrionic personality, anxious type), the individual's age, but also depending on social, environmental, family, professional factors. Prevalence of drug use is highest in the age group between 16-30 years when teenagers are prone to increased vulnerability, especially those with serious emotional problems. Aims: To emphasize the importance of recording and following the intellectual, emotional and social development of the addictive teenagers after a psychotic episode induced by drugs consumption and adapting treatment for each of these pacients. Methods: Use of psychostimulant drugs can cause symptoms of psychosis. People who are addicted to psychostimulant drugs can experience psychotic symptoms. Approaching this pathology in terms of a clinical case aims to highlight the symptoms of an acute psychotic episode, its origin, the correct diagnosis, early treatment and evolution of a teenager patient with such an addiction. The intensity of the symptoms depends on the type of the psychostimulant drug, the timing and duration of consumption, and the dosage. In many cases, people only need to take antipsychotics for a short time to get their symptoms under control. People with schizophrenia may have to stay on medications for life. Results and Discussions: It is also very important to recognize an acute psychotic episode and administer an early treatment which can change the course of a potentially illness. It is required a fast and adequate medical intervention established by a multidisciplinary team formed by a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a medical assistant who can help stopping the consumption of psychostimulant drugs, for following up the evolution of the patient, the acceptance of the treatment and also for social reinsertion. Conclusion: In Romania, it is compulsory to understand the necessity of a multidisciplinary team to work together for the wellbeing of a patient, for the family and friends of the patients to recognize and to admit the modifications in someone’s behavior and the administration of adequate medication in early stages of an illness to change its` course or to stop its’ evolution.",

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

Craving may be associated with risk-taking reckless behavior to seek pleasure including cigarette smoking, binge alcohol drinking, and illicit drug abuse (e.g. cocaine, methamphetamine, methylene deoxy meth-amphetamine (MDMA), ecstasy, morphine and heroine). Craving for food, sex and drugs involves the limbic system and prefrontal cortex. Thus, basic understanding of craving is exceedingly important for the better clinical management of major depression, hopelessness, and poor quality of life among young adolescents, as well as morbidity and early mortality among adults. Physical, psychological, nutritional, and medical rehabilitation may be helpful in the effective clinical management of patients with craving of any age, sex and race. Further studies on the psychology of craving will curb the number of hospital admissions as several victims of drug craving develop schizophrenia later in their life, if they remain untreated.",

      "title": "Antipsychotic Polypharmacy: A Dirty Little Secret or a Fashion?",
      "abstract": "Abstract The term polypharmacy was originally coined to refer to problems related to multiple drug consumption and excessive drug use during the treatment of a disease or disorder. In the treatment of schizophrenia, polypharmacy usually refers to the simultaneous use of 2 or more antipsychotic medications or combined (adjunct) medications such as mood stabilizers, antidepressants, anxiolytics, or hypnotics in addition to single or multiple antipsychotics. Two decades ago, antipsychotic polypharmacy was criticized as being more expensive, having unproven efficacy, and causing more side effects. However, in recent years, antipsychotic polypharmacy has become more or less acceptable in the views of clinical practitioners and academic researchers. Results from recent reviews have suggested that the common practice of antipsychotic polypharmacy lacks double-blind or high-quality evidence of efficacy, except for negative symptom reduction with aripiprazole augmentation. We reviewed some representative studies that enrolled large numbers of patients and compared antipsychotic polypharmacy and monotherapy during the past decade. The results revealed that a certain proportion of select patients can benefit from antipsychotic polypharmacy without further negative consequences. Because most of the current treatment guidelines from different countries and organizations prefer monotherapy and discourage all antipsychotic polypharmacy, guidelines regarding the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy in clinical practice should be revised. On the basis of the findings of 2 large-scale studies from Asia and Europe, we also suggest ideal rates of various maintenance treatments of schizophrenia, which are as follows: antipsychotic polypharmacy, 30%; combined mood stabilizer, 15%; combined antidepressant, 10%; combined anxiolytics, 30%; and combined hypnotic, 10%.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury.

(1) Bipolar and unipolar depression display similar symptoms, making correct diagnosis difficult. The differential diagnosis is especially problematic in patients suffering a first major depressive episode, when there is no clear history of mania or hypomania. Nevertheless, bipolar depression does have telltale signs--remembered with the mnemonic WHIPLASHED--to guide diagnosis. (2-8) Worse or wired when taking antidepressants. The patient complains of feeling antsy or being agitated or unable to sleep when taking traditional antidepressants. Look for numerous failed antidepressant trials, apparent tolerance to antidepressants that does not resolve with increased dose, and antidepressant-induced mania or mood cycle acceleration. Hypomania, hyperthymic temperament, or mood swings in a patient's history. Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence. Ask about periods of elevated mood or energy that might not fit formal DSM-IV-TR criteria for hypomania--such as episodes that last only a day or two. Mood lability in younger patients can be especially dramatic and poorly demarcated. Irritable, hostile, or mixed features. Some patients show one or more hypomanic features, such as racing thoughts when depressed. Psychomotor retardation appears more common in bipolar I depression than in unipolar major depression. Psychomotor agitation, however, is more likely in bipolar II than in unipolar major depression. Loaded family history of mood swings, frank bipolar disorder, or affective illness. A family history of comorbid mood disorder and alcoholism may also point to bipolarity.

A ansiedade ou medo pela anestesia, pelos instrumentais e ate pelo comportamento do cirurgiao dentista pode desenvolver a lipotimia ou ate mesmo a sincope. A lipotimia pode ser ocasionada pela sensacao iminente de desmaio sem perda da consciencia. Ja a sincope, estado de estresse emocional, devido a uma hipoperfusao sanguinea no cerebro ou ate mesmo uma reacao vasovagal, leva o paciente ao desmaio apresentando astenia, escurecimento da vista, vertigem, pele fria e pegajosa, palidez intensa, cianose, nauseas, emese e principalmente perda da consciencia. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi realizar uma revisao de literatura sobre as emergencias clinicas de sincope e lipotimia na odontologia. Foi utilizado como base de dados livros e bibliotecas eletronicas como PubMed e Scielo, resumindo e transcrevendo os dados coletados. Como resultado, foi observado que a lipotimia e a sincope sao as principais causas de emergencias medicas acometidas durante o tratamento dentario. Para a eficacia do atendimento de emergencia, os cirurgioes-dentistas, precisam estar aptos para lidar e tratar rapidamente a situacao, avaliando o grau de consciencia e o pulso arterial do paciente. Portanto, conclui-se para que os pacientes se sintam confortaveis e o nivel de ansiedade se mantenha baixo, e sugerido que o ambiente de consultorio dentario esteja em constante harmonia, pois qualquer fator do ambiente pode levar ao desenvolvimento de sincope e lipotimia.Descritores: Sincope; Pre-Sincope; Atendimento de Emergencia; Odontologia.",

Treatment options are thus limited to symptomatic presentations and strive to relieve patients and caregivers of some of the behavioral and psychiatric sequelae that can severely impact the quality of life. In fact, neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia affect virtually all patients with dementia at some time during the disease course and are associated with earlier institutionalization, increased caregiving costs (both financial and otherwise), and worsened disease progression. Unfortunately, pharmacological measures acting on neurocircuitry that may be damaged in the brains of patients with dementia as well as attempts to utilize non-pharmacological, cognition-acting strategies in cognitively impaired patients with dementia may not be as effective as they are for younger, non-demented patients. It is also important to note that improvements in behavioral symptoms (e.g., depression) may be due not solely to a prescribed psychotropic agent but may also be a result of the extra social contact with the treatment team that medication warrants.",

      "abstract": "The decision process preceding prescribing analgesics is complex and the physician is often struggling to balance several disparate considerations in order to work out what is rational. Several factors – medical, intellectual, emotional and logistic – influence the decision whether or not to prescribe, and the decision itself influences how the physicians feel about themselves. In this study the 'critical incident technique' was used for exploring the qualities of dilemmas among general physicians prior to prescribing analgesics to patients in primary health care. The study displayed two main types of problems in connection with prescription of opioids. The first main problem was a concern about abuse and addiction with no proper indication for the drug. The second main type of problem was related to the appropriateness of the drug, although the indication as such might be correct, i.e. acute or chronic pain. An important consequence of the dilemmas experienced influenced the physicians' self-esteem negatively, including failures in the patient–physician relationship. This results in emotional strain and is often experienced as a personal defeat. Only a few physicians denied prescription despite the experience of a dilemma, which might indicate an ambivalence or lack of knowledge among physicians with regard to proper indications for opioid prescription. However, it may also suggest that physicians need more training in saying no, or skills in deciding proper indications for opioids, which needs to be addressed during educational programmes.",

In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlexia is the phenomenon of spontaneous and precocious mastery of single‐word reading that has been of interest to clinicians and researchers since the beginning of the last century. Methods: An extensive search of publications on the subject of hyperlexia was undertaken and all available publications were reviewed. Results: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) whether hyperlexia should be defined through single‐word reading superiority with regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6) whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability (talent). Conclusions: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single‐word reading in the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a discrepancy between levels of single‐word reading and comprehension). We simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi‐methodological approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research framework of understanding single‐word reading, are warranted and encouraged.",

Seizures and status epilepticus can cause death in the acute phase, but they do not have a independent influence in long-term functional outcome. There is limited evidence concerning the optimal treatment options for post-stroke seizures, namely which antiepileptics should be used, or when treatment should begin or end.

A wide range of drugs, including fluoroquinolones, can cause mental status changes in the postoperative period. Thus, a thorough knowledge of various drug actions and interactions as well as various risk factors can help an anesthesiologist counter the possible deleterious effects of delirium during the perioperative period. The side effects of fluoroquinolones on the central nervous system are well documented, although they are rarely suspected as the offending agents for delirium.

      "abstract": "The neuroleptics are characterised by the large number of pharmacological effects they develop. When they are associated with other substances, it is frequent for the latter to have with neuroleptics one or several common sites of action. At this level, they develop phenomena of drug interaction, for example, synergy with depressors of the central nervous system or, in the periphery, with alpha-adrenolytic or parasympatholytic drugs. This type of interaction is used in anesthesia to obtain more intense effects with lesser doses of each component and also avoid the toxic effects of efficacious doses of general anesthetics used alone. However, although certain interactions are useful, others may prove harmful. This is in particular the case where neuroleptic drugs are administered after ingestion of alcohol. Various mechanisms, central and peripheral, explain the marked depression of the central nervous system which results. Potentialisation of the effects of tricyclic antidepressor drugs by neuroleptics raises a difficult problem for the anesthetist, the elimination of tricyclic antidepressor drugs is slow and requires several weeks after stopping treatment. During this period, the tissue and plasma concentrations become reduced gradually. They are pharmacologically insufficient, but are potentialised by injection of neuroleptic drugs, and may become active again, and even toxic. It seems to us advisable to avoid the use of neuroleptic drugs in patients treated with tricyclic antidepressor drugs and, if necessary, to use another method of anesthesia.",

Tobacco smoking is considered a predisposing factor for pulmonary and cardiovasculary diseases and a risk factor for developing OSA. Since snoring is frequent in smokers and a common symptom, even a preclinical form of OSA, it is reasonable to speculate that smoking is an independent risk factor for snoring and may be associated with OSA.

      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking and behaviors, are the hallmarks of schizophrenia; but may also present in the context of other psychiatric and medical conditions. Many children and adolescents describe psychotic-like experiences, which can be associated with other types of psychopathology and past experiences (e.g., trauma, substance use, and suicidality). However, most youth reporting such experiences do not have, nor will ever develop, schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Accurate assessment is critical because these different presentations have different diagnostic and treatment implications. For this review, we focus primarily on the diagnosis and treatment of early onset schizophrenia. In addition, we review the development of community-based first-episode psychosis programming, and the importance of early intervention and coordinated care.",

      "title": "Medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Medication nonadherence is common among patients with schizophrenia and due to a variety of factors including lack of insight, psychopathology, substance use disorder, issues associated with treatment, stigma, fragmentation of care, cultural influences, and socioeconomic status. Among this population, nonadherence is problematic because it can lead to decompensation or exacerbation of symptoms, relapse, rehospitalization or greater use of emergency psychiatric services, functional decline, and increased risk of death. Psychoeducational approaches alone are ineffective, but in combination with behavioral interventions, appear to be effective. Involving the patient's support system, in addition to other interventions, can improve treatment adherence. Many medication-related factors, such as effectiveness and tolerability of antipsychotics, regimen complexity, and past medication trials impact appropriate medication use. Therefore, optimizing the patient's pharmacotherapeutic regimens can improve adherence. Additional factors favorably influencing adherence include involving the patient in their treatment, fostering a therapeutic alliance, implementing/using reminder systems, and addressing substance use disorder. Medication nonadherence arises from multiple reasons that vary between patients. Thus, the most effective strategies to improve adherence are multifactorial and may involve both psychoeducational and behavioral techniques, as well as previously listed approaches. Strategies should be targeted toward the patient and their support system, whenever possible, to further improve the chances of appropriate medication use. Recognizing that all patients with schizophrenia are at risk for medication nonadherence is important. No one technique has been shown to be most effective; therefore, the risk for nonadherence should continually be assessed and multiple strategies should be targeted to the patient (and caregiver) and repeatedly implemented throughout the course of the patient's illness.",

La prevalencia de la paralisis cerebral infantil se ha mantenido estable en los ultimos 10 anos, afectando a 2,1 ninos por cada 1.000 nacidos vivos con cifras similares en Europa, Estados Unidos, Australia o Asia. Esta enfermedad puede clasificarse de acuerdo a la alteracion motora predominante en: (i) espastica (bilateral o unilateral); (ii) discinetica (distonica o coreoatetosica); (iii) ataxica; y (iv) no clasificable. Los factores de riesgo que se relacionan con la paralisis cerebral infantil pueden dividirse en prenatales, perinatales y postnatales siendo el principal la prematuridad, pero tambien influyendo las malformaciones congenitas, infecciones intrauterinas, morbilidad obstetrica y las infecciones del sistema nervioso central o traumatismos en el periodo postnatal. La manifestacion clinica que sugiere el sindrome es el retraso del desarrollo psicomotor entre los 12-18 meses de edad, la alteracion motora predominante dependera del sustrato neurologico afectado, mientras que pueden presentarse deficits cognitivos, epilepsia, trastornos visuales, auditivos y alteraciones musculo-esqueleticas secundarias. La valoracion a traves de las escalas de clasificacion de la funcion motora gruesa, de la manipulacion de objetos, la comunicacion o la alimentacion determina la severidad, guian el manejo clinico y permiten el seguimiento, por lo que se recomienda su utilizacion.

Conversely, speaking to a foreign-language user in one’s own environment demands special consideration; grammar must be simple, pronunciation clear, and redundancy is required. Both practical experience and common sense are needed to communicate across languages. Errors made and difficulties endured when trying to learn a second language parallel, to some degree, the problems an aphasic patient encounters in rehabilitation of language use. During the past few decades formal language rehabilitation programs have be come widely available. Most individuals with speech and language difficulties, including those with aphasia, receive formal diagnostic evaluations and many at tend remedial therapy programs. The widespread availability of aphasia therapy is a consequence of several factors: (1) language therapy has attained a respectable professional status with a growing scientific basis and the potential for much creativity; (2) the neurophysiological mechanisms of recovery after nervous-system injury are better understood; (3) enhanced understanding of the brain organization for language has facilitated the development of new remedial procedures; (4) home computers and other technical devices that are now widely available have been programmed for language rehabilitation.",

These medications also contribute to increased risk for falls, suicide, overdose fatality, and vehicle crashes.

      "abstract": "Because illicit drugs are now widely consumed, every doctor needs to know their acute medical consequences and complications. Here, we review the problems associated with the different drugs from a systems-based viewpoint. Apart from the respiratory depressant effect of opioids, crack cocaine is the most common cause of respiratory complications, mainly linked with its mode of use, with airway burns, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and lung syndromes being well-recognised sequelae. Because of its marked cardiovascular effects, cocaine is also a major cause of coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. Amphetamines may produce similar effects less commonly. Hyperthermia may occur with cocaine toxicity or with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) due to exertion or from serotonin syndrome. Cerebral haemorrhage may result from the use of amphetamines or cocaine. Hallucinations may follow consumption of LSD, amphetamines, or cocaine. MDMA is a major cause of acute severe hyponatraemia and also has been linked with hepatic syndromes. Collapse, convulsions, or coma may be caused in different circumstances by opioids, MDMA, or gamma hydroxybutyrate and may be aggravated by other sedatives, especially alcohol and benzodiazepines. Recognition of these acute complications is urgent, and treatment must be based on an understanding of the likely underlying problem as well as on basic principles of supportive care.",

      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Although most patients with epilepsy have normal cognitive abilities, they are at increased risk for cognitive deficits. Multiple factors contribute to this risk including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), which not only reduce neuronal irritability but may also impair neuronal excitability. The major cognitive effects of AEDs are impaired attention, vigilance, and psychomotor speed, but secondary effects on other cognitive functions can be seen. The adverse cognitive effects of AEDs are offset in part by reduced seizures. In general, the cognitive effects of AEDs are less than the sum total of other factors, but because AEDs are the major therapeutic modality for epilepsy, they are of special concern. AED-induced cognitive side effects are increased with rapid initiation, higher dosages, and polytherapy. Differential cognitive effects can be seen (e.g., worse performance on phenobarbital), but the magnitude of cognitive effects is relatively modest effects for most AEDs. However, even this modest effect can be clinically significant and impact the patient's quality of life. In addition, some patient groups may be at particular risk (e.g., elderly, children, fetus). The ultimate therapeutic goal is to control seizures with no or minimal side effects. The cognitive profile of an AED is but one factor in the selection of therapeutic options. Ongoing seizures can be detrimental to both cognition and quality of life. Patients who are refractory or intolerant to AED therapy should be referred for video EEG monitoring to confirm the seizure diagnosis and determine if the patient is a candidate for epilepsy surgery.",

SOD may manifest as strabismus, nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, or visual impairment; as an endocrine dysfunction in isolation; or in addition to mental retardation, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, or delayed growth.This article reviews the presenting signs and symptoms of SOD, optic nerve hypoplasia, consequences of an absent septum pellucidum, endocrine findings associated with SOD, SOD diagnosis determination, syndromes associated with SOD, and optometry's role in caring for these patients. It also examines two cases that demonstrate the variety and severity of visual and physical impairments associated with SOD.SOD has a multi-factorial etiology, including insult during pregnancy (e.g., viral infections, gestational diabetes); vascular disruption; or a genetic mutation. Children with SOD may manifest a variety of visual and/or physical symptoms that range from mild to severe.The associated vision, developmental, neurologic, and endocrine disturbances require early diagnosis and management. Optometrists need to be aware of optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and consider this diagnosis in patients with visual acuity loss. A comprehensive eye examination and visual-field assessment should be completed in addition to appropriate referrals for endocrine, developmental, and/or cognitive anomalies.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Uremic syndrome of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a term used to describe clinical, metabolic, and hormonal abnormalities associated with progressive kidney failure. It is a rapidly growing public health problem worldwide. Nervous system complications occur in every patient with uremic syndrome of CKD. Areas covered: This review summarized central and peripheral nervous system complications of uremic syndrome of CKD and their pathogenic mechanisms. They include cognitive deterioration, encephalopathy, seizures, asterixis, myoclonus, restless leg syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis, stroke, extrapyramidal movement disorders, neuropathies, and myopathy. Their pathogenic mechanisms are complex and multiple. They include (1) accumulation of uremic toxins resulting in neurotoxicity, blood-brain barrier injury, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, brain neurotransmitters imbalance, ischemic/microvascular changes, and brain metabolism dysfunction (e.g. dopamine deficiency), (2) metabolic derangement (as acidosis, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperkalemia); (3) secondary hyperparathyroidism, (4) erythropoietin and iron deficiency anemia, (5) thiamin, vitamin D, and other nutritional deficiencies, (6) hyperhomocysteinemia, and (7) coagulation problems. Expert commentary: Nervous system complications of uremia contribute to the patients' morbidity and mortality. Optimizing renal replacement therapy, correction of associated metabolic and medical conditions, and improved understanding of possible pathogenic mechanisms of these complications is a major target for their prevention and treatment.",

In this chapter, some classic histologic findings in acute and chronic poisoning (including substance abuse) are presented. The determination of cause and manner of death in a poisoning requires a careful summation of circumstance, toxicology, and autopsy. Toxicology results are usually necessary, but alone are not sufficient for forming an opinion on cause and manner. Many variables, including postmortem redistribution, post-exposure survival, and overlap between therapeutic and toxic ranges, introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of postmortem drug levels. Gross and microscopic findings at autopsy can be supportive of acute and/or chronic substance abuse or may show unexpected sequelae of chronic substance abuse (e.g., infective endocarditis). Sometimes histology may be the first clue in a case of poisoning.

El objetivo es dar a conocer esta patología, cada vez más prevalente en la población psiquiátrica. 2. Material y métodos Revisión de la bibliografía reciente sobre la PP, en especial la psicógena. 3. Resultados y conclusiones La PP se puede clasificar en dos tipos: la polidipsia psicógena y la dipsogénica. La polidipsia psicógena, también llamada ingesta de agua compulsiva o potomanía, es común en pacientes con trastorno del neurodesarrollo y trastornos psicóticos crónicos como la esquizofrenia, pero también se ha observado en depresión, ansiedad, TOC, anorexia nerviosa o alcoholismo. La dipsogénica afecta a personas sanas o con disfunción hipotalámica. Los pacientes con trastornos psicóticos raramente se quejan de sed y explican su excesiva ingesta con contenidos delirantes o porque les reduce su ansiedad y les hace sentir mejor. En la mayoría de los casos la restricción hídrica es el tratamiento, una medida difícilmente controlable. Aunque existen datos de la coadyuvancia con diferentes fármacos, ninguno ha demostrado suficiente evidencia científica. La hiponatremia sintomática es la manifestación clínica más importante de la PP, llegando a ser mortal si no se identifica y trata a tiempo. Los pacientes con esquizofrenia y otros trastornos psicóticos son los más afectados, por lo que debemos tenerla en cuenta y coordinarnos con otros servicios médicos en caso de sospecharla. Poco se conoce acerca de la fisiopatología y tratamiento de la polidipsia psicógena, lo que hace necesario ampliar su investigación y difusión.",

      "title": "The effect of nasal introduction of anaesthetic in adults undergoing Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES): A systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The primary objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesise the best available evidence on the effect of anaesthetic on the physiological aspects of swallowing (rate, strength, and risk of laryngeal penetration or aspiration) as well as client pain and/or discomfort in adults undergoing Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). This procedure is also described as Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory testing (FEESS or FEESST) and Videoendoscopic Evaluation of Dysphagia (VEED). Background Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing disorder. Aetiologies include medical (respiratory illness, medications, general deterioration), neurological or neuromuscular (cerebrovascular accident [CVA], dementia, progressive disease such as Motor Neurone Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease), congenital (cerebral palsy, cleft palate, intellectual disability), traumatic (brain injury, structural change, damage or cancer surgery, radiation therapy), psychiatric, psychological, functional (no known aetiology) and oesophageal structural deformities. 1 Oropharyngeal dysphagia may be described as a ‘sensation that solids or liquids are not being swallowed correctly’. 1(p. 339) Patients may also have symptoms such as coughing, choking, or a feeling of material still in their throat. Impaired swallowing is a problem because it may lead to significant medical conditions such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, and weight loss. 2 The FEES is a procedure which allows visualisation of the anatomical structures involved in swallowing. This technique allows assessment of swallow competency, diagnosis of pharyngeal dysphagia, and laryngeal penetration of food or fluids. 3-5 FEES gives a ‘real time’ evaluation, and allows for trialling techniques and modifications of food and fluids to determine therapy strategies for safe swallowing that work for that particular client. It does not expose the client to ionising radiation associated with Modified Barium Swallow (MBS) and provides immediate information about the efficiency of the protective cough reflex. 1, 4-6 The FEES procedure is typically undertaken by speech pathologists and otolaryngologists (Ear Nose and Throat specialists) to evaluate and diagnose swallowing disorders/competence. It involves the transnasal introduction of a flexible nasendoscope through the nose and into the hypopharynx. Food or fluid is then introduced orally and the pharyngeal phase of swallowing process observed. 6 The FEES procedure is an assessment tool designed to aid patients with swallowing difficulties. Figure 1 (adapted from 7) presents a schematic diagram of the flexible nasendoscope placement during the FEES procedure.Figure 1: Illustration of laryngoscope placement during the FEES procedure, adapted from 7During FEES swallowing function is evaluated using anatomical and functional criteria. Food and/or fluid are introduced and there is an evaluation of any premature spillage of the bolus into the pharynx or larynx, whether there is a risk of penetration or aspiration of the bolus before the swallow is triggered. Once the swallow has been completed, evidence of residue within the hypopharynx, or around it, suggests laryngeal or pharyngeal weakness. Evidence of bolus in the trachea is an indication of aspiration. Multiple swallows for each bolus may indicate weakness of the tongue base or posterior pharyngeal wall. 1, 8, 9 FEES allows a physical examination of structural movements during a swallow of different foods and liquids. Interventions, which commonly include dietary and/or behavioural modifications, are prescribed to lessen swallowing difficulty if swallow impairment is diagnosed. 9 A ‘competent’ swallow is commonly defined as timely (less than three seconds after oral preparation of the bolus), complete such that the whole bolus is swallowed without pharyngeal residue, and propulsion to the oesophagus occurs, with no penetration or aspiration into the larynx. A ‘competent’ swallow is not effortful and does not generally require double or multiple swallows.8 An accurate result of the swallow evaluation is critical as it facilitates appropriate patient referral and treatment, outcomes that can significantly affect quality of life 9 and health 3. For many years dysphagia assessment and management was conducted using clinical (bedside) assessment, or videofluoroscopic studies (MBS).10 Bedside assessment involves a trial of food and fluids, and an oro-motor examination. The result of a bedside assessment is reliant on the clinician's ability to detect, and evaluate oral and pharyngeal dysphagia and gain knowledge of oesophageal symptoms based on the patient's medical history. When the FEES swallow evaluation procedure is used, there is a visual assessment of what is actually happening which is not possible in the bedside assessment. Calculated evaluations can be made using results from the bedside approach, but a clear diagnosis is often difficult, 11 and even the most experienced clinicians can fail during a bedside examination to identify approximately 40% of aspirating patients. 11Clinical evaluation has its place, however it is problematic in that silent aspiration (i.e. no overt evidence such as coughing or choking when food or fluids enter below the vocal cords) is not detected.4 Scott et al 12 have pointed out that swallowing is a complex activity involving several rapid, integrated movements, few of which could be observed directly which makes evaluating it complex. In addition, a cough can be an unreliable indicator of aspiration.13 Whilst reasonable conclusions can be made with clinical evaluation, there is the danger of inaccurate diagnosis and inappropriate recommendations leading to negative impacts on patient health outcomes and quality of life 3. Videofluoroscopic studies, such as the MBS, have been used for diagnosis and evaluation of dysphagia since the 1980's. 8 This procedure evaluates the oral phase, pharyngeal phase and the oesophageal transit. Small amounts of food and liquid (with barium paste) are introduced and followed radiographically from mouth to the lower oesophageal sphincter. This procedure is carried out in a radiology suite, with a radiologist and radiology technician present, and generally a speech pathologist. It requires the patient to be able to sit upright. At times this precludes very ill patients and those who find the physical demands of the procedure too difficult. 8 The FEES procedure was formalised by Susan E Langmore in the late 1980's. Its introduction was a “collaborative effort” 8(p. 1386) between the specialties of speech pathology and otolaryngology. Prior to this development, otolaryngologists had largely screened patients and diagnosed swallowing disorders 8. Langmore identified the clinical usefulness of FEES for analysis of function as compared with medical pathology which would only allow assessment of anatomical not functional pathologies. The advantages of FEES over MBS include its portability and easy access for physically disadvantaged patients, the lack of need for a radiology suite (and radiologist), its relative cost-effectiveness, no radiation exposure (and therefore any amount of time can be used to determine a diagnosis), the ability to directly visualise and record the pharynx and larynx, and its sensitivity in detection of and severity rating of aspiration. 3, 5, 6, 14 FEES is the evaluation of choice where a patient is compromised by radiation necessary for the MBS, and especially where repetitive examinations are required, for example for biofeedback. During FEES the food and fluid is dyed with colour to enhance visibility. At times, the end of the scope can become covered with oropharyngeal secretions or food or fluid, although this can be easily cleared by an experienced endoscopist using techniques to slightly change the position of the scope to clear the residue. In addition, during swallowing the endoscope will be momentarily pushed against the posterior pharyngeal wall, causing ‘white-out’ (this occurs for about half a second). 11 Some clinicians may consider this a disadvantage of FEES, as visual recording, or observation, is briefly lost. The risk of complications with FEES is regarded as low, but may include: a reaction to the anaesthetic, laryngospasm, epistaxis (nosebleeds), fainting, laryngospasm. 9 Hence, the availability of medical response if required is necessary when performing a FEES. Swallowing function includes three main phases, namely the oral, pharyngeal and oesophageal phase. Dysphagia may occur in any one of these phases 1 and in individuals of any age.14 FEES effectively evaluates the pharyngeal phase and any laryngeal penetration and aspiration (liquid or food going into the ‘wind pipe’).1, 6, 8, 11 However, it is unable to evaluate either the oral or oesophageal swallow phases as the scope is passed through the nasopharynx (nose and back of the throat). FEES is effective at identifying silent aspiration 3, which may be defined as entry of the bolus below the level of the true vocal folds without any external behavioural signs such as coughing or choking. 4 Speech pathologists have specific training to make recommendations about a safe diet and fluid consistency for a dysphagic client to swallow. Based on the outcomes of the FEES procedure, they can be more certain of the efficacy of their recommendations. The recommended foods and fluids may need to be modified in consistency depending on the evaluation of dysphagia, thereby affecting quality of life of the client. FEES is important in that it facilitates a more precise determination of the food and fluids safe for swallowing as the procedure allows visualisation of the client swallowing those actual consistencies.3, 15, 16 This is why it is important to understand whether the use of anaesthetic during FEES affects the accuracy of the swallow function diagnosis. During FEES the thin flexible nasendoscope is introduced into the client's nose and then passed through to the back of the throat (Figure 1). For accurate placement and prevention of tissue damage, the client is advised to stay still. Anaesthetic is commonly introduced as a means to reduce client anxiety, pain and discomfort and minimise client movement during the procedure. The most common form of anaesthetic introduction is via the application of a topical or spray anaesthetic into the nostril prior to the introduction of the nasendoscope. 1, 10, 15, 17 The use of anaesthetic during the FEES procedure is a topic of debate both in the literature and practice relating to diagnosing and treating swallow function. 2, 18, 19 In practice, otolaryngologists frequently use anaesthetic to evaluate structure whereas speech pathologists are not authorised to use anaesthetic and therefore require the presence of an Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist or other medically trained professional when it is being used. The tendency for FEES to be conducted with anaesthetic, and restrictions relating to which health professionals can administer anaesthetic during FEES limits access to FEES in facilities where there is unavailability of medical practitioners authorised to administer anaesthetic. As is explained in more detail below, the debate on the use of and need for anaesthetic when conducting FEES focuses on whether application of anaesthetic influences swallowing function and the accuracy of the diagnosis of dysphagia as well as anaesthetic's effectiveness for reducing client pain/discomfort and anxiety. The amount of anaesthetic, timing of anaesthetic, use of vasoconstrictor in addition to the anaesthetic and the method of application, have all been shown to vary across research studies and in clinical practice. Types and amounts of anaesthetic as described in the literature include Lidocaine 5, 20 20mg Cophenylcaine, 21 Cocaine, 22 2% Tetracaine.1, 17 Application methods also vary and include being applied nasally, orally, or with a cotton bud 23 or orviaaerosol puff.18 In addition, a vasoconstricting drug may also be applied in order to constrict the nasal mucosa and create a wider space to introduce the scope. 23 The sensation required for efficient swallowing is controlled by three cranial nerves innervating muscles of the mouth and pharynx. These nerves are the trigeminal, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. 2 The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve is regarded as the most important trigger for swallowing. Anaesthesia of areas innervated by these nerves can affect, but not completely diminish, the ability to swallow. This suggests that a person may have a less efficient swallow due to anaesthesia. 2, 7, 18, 19, 24. Aspiration with anaesthesia is described in the literature 18, suggesting increased risk during a FEES procedure if using anaesthetic. 2, 4, 7, 18, 19, 25 Therefore the clinician is potentially disadvantaged in their decision making. Another advantage of using anaesthetic during the FEES procedure, aside from its potential to reduce patient pain and discomfort raised in the debate over use of anaesthetic and FEES, is its potential to allow a more thorough assessment by the endoscopist because it is less distressing for the patient. However, some practitioners are of the view that the scope manoeuvres easily without anaesthetic. A disadvantage of using anaesthetic during FEES, raised both in discussions amongst those using the FEES procedure in practice in South Australia as well as in the literature 2, 20, is that it may cause a patient to experience a bitter taste. The client also has a ‘numb’ sensation for some time after application of the anaesthetic and is unable to drink or eat, because of the risk of aspiration, for around a half hour after the procedure. In the context of this debate over the use of anaesthetic when undertaking FEES it is important to conduct the systematic review proposed to enhance understanding about whether: (i) anaesthetic has a significant effect on the pain/comfort and anxiety experienced by the patient during the procedure; and/or (ii) it effects swallow function and swallow function diagnosis and thereby leads to an inappropriate management plan being recommended. No systematic review has been undertaken to date on the effects of anaesthetic during the FEES procedure. A preliminary search of the JBI Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library, PubMed and CINAHL found no systematic review protocols or reports on this topic. It is anticipated that the findings of this review will be used to enhance endoscopists’ decision making on the use of an anaesthetic agent when conducting FEES.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts.

The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "abstract": "Depression and dysthymia in late life reflects a spectrum of disorders rather than a construct, with multiple biopsychosocial factors that influence how depression is manifested. Symptoms of grief or bereavement may be characterized by agitation, somatic complaint and social withdrawal. Other situational factors may precipitate maladjustment with depressed mood. Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

The pharmacologic effect of the drug is achieved by inhibition of reuptake of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) into glial cells and neurons, without permanent increase in whole brain GABA concentration. Symptoms of acute tiagabine overdose include seizures, coma, respiratory depression ' and less often dystonias, involuntary movements, somnolence, agitation, tachycardia and increase or decrease of blood pressure. Two cases of acute tiagabine overdose have been described in the paper presenting with partial and generalized seizures which were managed with benzodiazepines.The onset of symptoms of acute tiagabine overdose is rapid with resolution within first 24 hours from exposure. Acute tiagabine poisoning may present with a wide variety of neurological symptoms. Administration of benzodiazepines may improve the outcome of overdose.",

      "abstract": "Two major questions about addictive behaviors need to be explained by any worthwhile neurobiological theory. First, why do people seek drugs in the first place? Second, why do some people who use drugs seem to eventually become unable to resist drug temptation and so become \"addicted\"? We will review the theories of addiction that address negative-reinforcement views of drug use (i.e., taking opioids to alleviate distress or withdrawal), positive-reinforcement views (i.e., taking drugs for euphoria), habit views (i.e., growth of automatic drug-use routines), incentive-sensitization views (i.e., growth of excessive \"wanting\" to take drugs as a result of dopamine-related sensitization), and cognitive-dysfunction views (i.e., impaired prefrontal top-down control), including those involving competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS), and the role of the insula in modulating addictive drug craving. In the special case of opioids, particular attention is paid to whether their analgesic effects overlap with their reinforcing effects and whether the perceived low risk of taking legal medicinal opioids, which are often prescribed by a health professional, could play a role in the decision to use. Specifically, we will address the issue of predisposition or vulnerability to becoming addicted to drugs (i.e., the question of why some people who experiment with drugs develop an addiction, while others do not). Finally, we review attempts to develop novel therapeutic strategies and policy ideas that could help prevent opioid and other substance abuse.",

      "abstract": "The quality of life of an epileptic patient largely depends on the interplay of the control of the convulsive crises and the degree to which higher mental functions are affected. Some types of epilepsy lead to mental retardation during development and with others the basic cerebral mechanisms for processing data are damaged and this may lead to transient or permanent cogniscitive deterioration.There are certain important clinical factors such as the site of the discharge regarding the lobe, hemisphere, type of cerebral area involved and the age of the patient. We describe the clinical features of each type of epilepsy with respect to focal or generalized involvement. The subclinical effects of continuous discharges affects processing in the areas involved and therefore intellectual function, thus leading to a secondary learning disorder. The neuropsychological tests used in investigation of higher cerebral functions in epilepsy include, in general, tests to assess speed of processing, attention, memory, reasoning and visuospacial ability and frontal executive functions.These tests should be sufficiently sensitive so as to detect minimal changes in the state of the illness, the time elapsed and the medication given. Anticonvulsant drugs may themselves cause changes in mental functions. There may often be mixed neurocognitive behaviour depending on the drug used. There may also be transient cognitive deterioration.",

      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is often associated with altered cognitive function and depression, although patients may also present with disorientation, memory impairment, dementia, auditory distortions, psychomotor retardation and psychosis. Although most patients achieve symptom resolution with levothyroxine replacement therapy, a minority have persistent symptoms. This report presents a case of rapid improvement of neu -ropsychiatric symptoms with levothyroxine replacement. To prepare this case report, we reviewed studies published in PubMed up to February 2012. The following mesh terms were used as keywords in our search: “hypothyroidism”, “dementia” and “cognition disorders”. An 81-year-old man presented to the hospital with behav -ioral disturbance, memory impairment, agnosia, apraxia and paranoid delusions but demonstrated no sensory disturbance. His symptoms had started 4 years previously but had worsened over the past year. His daughter reported that he had hyperten -sion, seizures and inguinal hernia, all of which had remained untreated, and stated that he was not taking any medications. He had no personal history of mood or psychotic disorders; however, one brother had committed suicide, and two of his daughters had mental retardation. He had dry skin, no tendon reflexes, an abnormal tandem gait and suffered from fatigue and intolerance to cold. His Mini-Mental score was 15 (one year of studies). His TSH was 222.28, free thyroxine 1,000. An EEG revealed diffuse slowing, and an MRI showed possible ischemic sequelae and posterior-parietal encephalomalacia, most likely due to an old trauma. We administered up to 100 µg levothyroxine, haloperidol, and valproate. After ten days, he felt no fatigue and had no delusions, his memory and orientation had improved, and his Mini-Mental score had increased to 19. After 40 days, his Mini-Mental score had increased to 21, his free thyroxine was 0.7 and his TSH was 23. He was sent home with a planned outpatient follow-up.The main diagnosis was reversible dementia due to hypo -thyroidism, but mental retardation and vascular or Alzheimer dementia cannot be excluded. Hashimoto’s encephalopathy (HE) was also considered due to his high anti-TPO levels.Regarding overt hypothyroidism, we identified one study that documented a deficit in verbal memory that improved with levothyroxine therapy, suggesting that this deficit is reversible.",

However, one of the hallmark features of hallucinogens or psychedelic agents is their ability to induce states of altered or distorted perception, thought, and mood. Many hallucinogens produce classic sympathomimetic effects; that is, hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. However, the effects vary considerably, depending upon the hallucinogen ingested. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is suffering from hallucinogen intoxication such as marijuana use can be helpful to the clinician. However, the common toxicologic drug screens used by most clinical laboratories do not detect many hallucinogenic agents (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide]). Thus, diagnosis of hallucinogen ingestion and treatment is often based on history of use and physical examination.",

Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang.

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

A simplified interpretation of this definition is presented in Figure 91.1. Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident). On the other hand, person with single episode of an alcohol-related problem is not necessarily an alcoholic; in such case, the condition may be better termed alcohol abuse.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

Anticonvulsant, antidepressant, and antipsychotic drugs can be associated with significant liver injury or liver failure, but this is relatively rare compared to other non-psychotropic drug classes. More commonly, mild asymptomatic elevations in liver function tests are seen and these are not predictive of progression to more severe liver injury. Laboratory monitoring of liver function before and during treatment is recommended with the use of valproic acid and carbamazepine, but not for other psychotropic drugs, although regular laboratory testing is not a reliable method for detecting or preventing severe liver injury. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity or hypersensitivity reactions that affect the liver is more important.

Entre las sustancias con mayor poder adictivo se encuentran los opioides como la morfina y sus derivados. La administracion cronica de morfina produce un estado de tolerancia caracterizado por una serie de cambios neuroadaptativos que conducen a una disminucion progresiva de efecto a medida que la sustancia se consume reiteradamente. La dependencia consiste en un trastorno conductual, psicologico, bioquimico y molecular por el que el individuo tiene disminuido el control sobre el consumo de una droga. La mayoria de estudios de tolerancia/dependencia se han realizado en SNC, existiendo en la actualidad un gran desconocimiento de los mecanismos responsables de estos fenomenos a nivel cardiaco. Nuestro objetivo global fue contribuir a esclarecer algunos de los mecanismos celulares y moleculares que subyacen en la modificaciones cardiacas que se producen durante el sindrome de abstinencia a opioides. Para ello estudiamos el recambio de noradrenalina en corazon durante el sindrome de abstinencia a morfina tras la administracion de naloxona, asi como, tras la administracion del derivado cuaternario naloxona metil yoduro (NxM) con el objeto de averiguar si la hiperactividad noradrenergica observada durante el sindrome de abstinencia era debida a mecanismos perifericos independientes del SNC. El analisis de NA y sus metabolitos se realizo mediante HPLC. Los resultados mostraron que la activacion cronica del receptor opioide producia una serie de fenomenos adaptativos compensatorios en las neuronas noradrenergicas cardiacas, que darian lugar a cambios en la sintesis y/o liberacion de NA, procesos que quedan desenmascarados durante el sindrome de abstinencia a morfina.

      "abstract": "The half-life of a drug is the time taken for the blood level of the drug to fall by half, provided that no more doses of the drug are administered in the intervening period. Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

The patient experienced acute dystonic reactions on three separate occasions when he forgot to take his methylphenidate medication. The present report informs clinicians about the possible side effects, such as dystonia, when psychostimulant and antipsychotic drug combinations are altered and suggests that the abrupt cessation of stimulants may lead to the development of movement disorders. Therefore, appropriate care is necessary when changing the dose of a drug or abruptly discontinuing a drug from a combination of psychostimulants and antipsychotics.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

He developed a cholinergic rebound syndrome including delirium and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). The delay included time spent in two different medical hospitals: one awaiting psychiatric bedspace, and secondly, when the patient's cholinergic rebound syndrome was misdiagnosed as acute alcohol withdrawal. Once the etiology was recognized, he was promptly treated with anticholinergic medication (benztropine) and retitrated to his outpatient dose of clozapine leading to the resolution of symptoms including delirium and EPS. This case will discuss the challenges of continuity of care in delirious, psychotic, or otherwise confused patients, including contributions from the COVID-19 pandemic.

      "title": "A complex polymorphous psychosis or a cycloid psychosis with a different onset?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute and transitory psychotic disorders comprise a polymorphous picture such as Leonhard’s cycloid psychoses, which alternate episodes of affective symptoms such as psychosis between two poles (anguish/happiness, incoherence/stupor, or akinesia/hyperkinesia). Objectives To describe a case report of a 20-year-old man, in outpatient psychiatric follow-up, after debuting at age 18 with a severe depressive episode of endogenomorphic characteristics without psychotic symptoms, with subsequent complete remission. Two years after clinical stability, he required prolonged hospitalization due to polymorphous psychotic syndrome of abrupt onset in a context of previous continuous use of cannabis and cocaine. Suspicion towards parents, bizarre behaviors, rushing desires, unmotivated laughter, fixed gaze, bewilderment, anguish with a feeling of imminent death, alternates with euphoria and senseless purchases. Methods We present the case report of this patient with a mental examination of conscious, scattered attention with marked distractibility, confusion and experiences of strangeness, memory gaps, subjective sensation of well-being with tachypsychia, which fluctuates with thymic oscillations and alternates with episodes of marked indefinite anguish, intense anxiety with delusional fear of the death of him or his family. Little systematized ideas of reference and prejudice based on intuitions or delusional occurrences in their environment. Megalomaniac and religious-messianic ideation. No sensory perception disturbances. Disintegrated course of thought, with frequent illogical associations, ambivalence of thought, affectivity and psychomotricity. Motor restlessness and behavioral disorganization. Global insomnia. Judgment of reality and superior functions diminished. No auto/heteroaggressiveness. Results Various psychoactive drugs were tested for two months, obtaining a response only with valproic acid 1500mg, pregabalin 450mg and olanzapine 15mg, presenting slow improvement in a situation of absence of consumption, with a predominance of symptomatic polymorphism, decreasing fluctuation between episodes of expansiveness and psychotic anguish, remitting disorganization and motility alterations, persisting poor awareness of the disease and cognitive complaints. He was referred for follow-up at the mental health center where his gradual recovery continued. A differential diagnosis of polymorphous psychosis is proposed, compatible with a cycloid psychosis of the anxiety-happiness type with marked affective symptoms, precipitated by substance use. Conclusions Cycloid anxiety-happiness psychosis stands out for intense and fluctuating anxiety, oscillating with feelings of happiness, ecstasy, and placidity, mystical-religious delusions, and preoccupation with death, which may comprise a different psychotic debut.

      "abstract": "La relacion entre depresion y demencia es compleja y ha sido tema de debate recientemente, debido a que las alteraciones cognitivas pueden ser encontradas en ambos padecimientos. La enfermedad de Alzheimer es una condicion neurodegenerativa  caracterizada por deterioro cognitivo, conductual y del funcionamiento global, con un inicio insidioso y curso progresivo que aparece principalmente en la vejez. Por otro lado, la depresion es un trastorno del estado de animo que en altos niveles de gravedad muestra en adultos mayores alteraciones cognitivas significativas que pueden confundirse con un sindrome demencial. Se reporta el caso de una mujer de 75 anos de edad con datos de un probable trastorno depresivo mayor y con quejas de perdida de memoria desde hace 3 anos. A la evaluacion neuropsicologica se observan alteraciones cognitivas importantes en el funcionamiento mnesico ademas del funcionamiento ejecutivo, caracterizados por: una deficiente capacidad de aprendizaje de nueva informacion con respecto a lo esperado para su edad y nivel de escolaridad, una perdida importante de elementos visuales y auditivos a corto y largo plazo, ademas de una significativa presencia de perseveraciones e intrusiones, con un marcado deficit en el automonitoreo. Como apoyo los estudios de neuroimagen muestran disminucion del volumen cortical en regiones temporoparietales bilateral, asi como hipoperfusion asociada a dichas zonas. Con los resultados de la evaluacion neuropsicologica en correlacion con las dificultades en las actividades de la vida diaria, mas los estudios de neuroimagen, se puede apoyar el diagnostico de posible demencia tipo Alzheimer, descartando el de pseudo demencia por depresion.",

      "title": "Biomarcadores de estrés e inflamación en la psicosis temprana",
      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, de consecuencias devastadoras, que afecta como una persona piensa, siente y actua. Tiene un gran impacto en la salud de la poblacion, afectando entre 7 a 8 personas por cada 1.000. Mas alarmante es el hecho de que en Espana, los anos de vida potencialmente perdidos por muerte prematura o discapacidad atribuible, la situan en el primer lugar junto con otras enfermedades neurologicas. En la esquizofrenia se debe intervenir cuanto antes, ya que el tiempo de psicosis que transcurra sin tratar, conduce a la persona hacia una evolucion poco satisfactoria. Para cuando un joven reciba tratamiento por un trastorno psicotico incipiente, el dano neurologico y psicosocial ya habra ocurrido, afectando dominios fundamentales para su desarrollo como persona, que le aseguraran un futuro con peores logros educativos, mayor desempleo y una menor autonomia e independencia. No se conoce con exactitud como se origina la esquizofrenia, pero diversas variantes del genoma, al igual que los factores ambientales, el estres y la inflamacion, juegan un papel relevante. La evidencia acumulada demuestra tambien que en estos pacientes se encuentran niveles aumentados de marcadores inflamatorios (interleucina 6 [IL-6], proteina C reactiva [CRP] y fibrinogeno) y de prolactina (no asociado al tratamiento antipsicotico), ademas de un deterioro en la regulacion del eje hipotalamo-hipofisis-suprarrenal (HHS). El diagnostico de sujetos con alto riesgo de psicosis es eminentemente clinico, siendo perentoria la identificacion de posibles biomarcadores que contribuyan a aumentar el valor predictivo de los criterios de riesgo ultra elevado (UHR). Este trabajo de tesis doctoral se centra en el estudio de dichos biomarcadores, integrando el trabajo experimental al estudio de sujetos con estado mental de alto riesgo (EMAR) de psicosis y pacientes con un trastorno psicotico incipiente (TPI) que asisten a un centro de intervencion precoz, por lo que nos planteamos como supuesto fundamental, que el estres ambiental y los biomarcadores relacionados con el estres (cortisol y prolactina) y la inflamacion (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogeno y albumina), se asocian con el riesgo de desarrollar un TPI en las etapas iniciales de la psicosis. Para ello se determinaron los niveles de los distintos biomarcadores en suero (IL-6, CRP, albumina, cortisol y prolactina), plasma (fibrinogeno) y saliva (cortisol basal y respuesta del cortisol al despertar). Tambien se genotipo a partir del DNA genomico el SNP funcional del IL6 rs1800795. Se valoro clinicamente a los participantes mediante la adaptacion espanola del SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) a fin de obtener diagnosticos segun el DSM-IV. Se valoro el nivel de UHR en sujetos EMAR mediante la aplicacion de la CAARMS (Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States). Por ultimo, se midio la severidad de los sintomas positivos y negativos mediante la escala PANSS, el estres percibido mediante la Escala de Reajuste Social de Holmes-Rahe, la percepcion psicologica del estres aplicando la Escala de Estres Percibido, se valoro los habitos dieteticos mediante la entrevista clinica nutricional, y los sintomas depresivos aplicando las escalas de depresion de Hamilton (HDRS) y de Calgary para esquizofrenia (CDSS). Un primer estudio transversal demostro niveles aumentados de IL-6 en sujetos EMAR frente a controles sanos, y la asociacion positiva de la IL-6 con los sintomas negativos tanto en EMAR como en TPI, y la asociacion positiva (EMAR) y negativa (TPI) con los sintomas positivos. 35% de los sujetos EMAR hicieron la transicion a psicosis (EMAR-P) presentando un aumento no significativas del nivel de la IL-6 frente a quienes no la hicieron (EMAR-NP). Un segundo estudio, de caracter longitudinal, demostro niveles elevados de estres psicologico, prolactina y mas bajos de albumina en sujetos EMAR-P frente a los EMAR-NP y el grupo control. Tambien encontramos diferencias significativas en la secrecion de cortisol al despertar. En el tercer estudio de esta tesis doctoral, de caracter transversal, confirmamos la hipotesis que niveles bajos de los marcadores de inflamacion periferica (CRP y fibrinogeno) estan asociados con el tratamiento antidepresivo en sujetos con un TPI.",

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "abstract": "The repertoire of behavioral symptoms depends on the degree of severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

      "abstract": "Addictive behavior developes after repeated substance use and it typically include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to the drug use than to other activities. Relapse, the resumption of drug taking after periods of abstinence, remains the major problem for the treatment of addiction. The process of drug addiction shares striking commonalities with neural plasticity associated with natural reward learning and memory and is caused primarily by drug-induced sensitization in the brain mesocorticolimbic systems that attribute incentive salience to reward-associated stimuli. The switch from controlled to compulsive drug seeking represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control. Current neurophysiologic evidence suggests that the development of addiction is to some extent due to neurochemical stimulation of the midbrain dopaminergic system that is traditionally considered as a 'common neural currency' for rewards of most kinds. Addictions are a result of the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors. They are characterized by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity as well as polygenicity. Environmental factors are crucial in addiction vulnerability and resistese too.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "DiscussionThere has been an increase recently in the use of L.S.D. in this country on a casual basis and not under medical supervision.Use in this way as a \"mind-expanding\" drug has been extensively discussed in the press and on television, and has been advocated in non-medical journals.After a similar interest in the non-medical uses of the drug and extensive self-medication by fringe groups in New York therc was a sudden upsurge of admissions to Bellevue Hospital with acute reactions from its use (Frosch et al., 1965).These fell into three groups: (1) acute panic reactions; (2) recurrence of symptoms while abstaining from the drug, which was more likely to occur after multiple ingestion; and (3) prolonged psychosis.Cases 1, 2, and 5 reported here appeared to be acute panic reactions, and Cases 3 and 4 a recurrence of symptoms in a period of abstinence.Case 4 also showed signs of a prolonged psychosis.Case 6 may have been due to disordered judge- ment or a psychotic reaction.Prolonged adverse reactions, including chronic hallucinatory states, also occur (Rosenthal, 1964).Owing to the fashion of using sugar cubes as a vehicle for black market L.S.D. it can also be taken accidentally-for example, by children-and three such cases have been reported.One of these sustained a dissociative state, accom- panied by anxiety and visual illusions, that lasted for several weeks (Cohen, 1966).Cases 5 and 6 show the need to look for L.S.D. and amphetamines at necropsy in deaths of this type, lest some be wrongly attributed to suicide.Despite the statements of the protagonists of the use of this drug that it is safe, L.S.D. can be dangerous when taken casually-for example, when not taken by selected patients under strict medical supervision and with the use of proper safeguards.The incidence of adverse effects associated with controlled use of the drug by physicians suggested that in medical hands it was an exceptionally safe drug (Levine and Ludwig, 1964). SummaryRecently there has been an increase in the use of lysergide (lysergic acid diethylamide; L.S.D.) obtained illicitly.Adverse reactions are not uncommon, and six (two fatal) cases are reported.I am grateful to Professor F. E. Camps, Dr. A. Robinson, and Mr. F. F",

      "abstract": "The second most prevalent cause of years of disability worldwide is migraine, a neurological condition that causes a persistent headache that is lifelong. This condition affects more than a billion people globally. Its widespread prevalence and concomitant impairment have several adverse effects. Migraines are brought on by numerous behavioural, ecological, and genetic factors. There are various types of migraines, of which migraine without aura is the most common. The objective of this article is to determine the causes of migraine headaches, review the appropriate diagnosis of migraine, and describe the migraine headache management alternatives that are available. Various treatments for migraine are available on the market. Among the many types of headaches, migraines are neurological in nature and are inherited in some people. It has four phases: prodromal phase, aura, attack phase, and postdrome phase. Stress, anxiety, changes in the female endocrine system, bright lights, loud noises, foul odour, excessive or insufficient sleep, changes in the environment or the climate, flashes of light or intense lighting, overexertion, missing meals, drinking alcohol and smoking, quitting caffeine, and taking too many migraine drugs are some of the triggering factors for migraine. Diagnosis of migraine mainly relies on a good history. Appropriate prevention can be done for specific indications. Treatment mainly revolves around medications like analgesics, triptans, ergot derivatives, and newly derived biologics. Lifestyle modifications are also essential as many daily life factors contribute to migraine. Migraine can be well-managed if sufficient attention and care are given along with proper medications and guidance. The patient should not ignore symptoms and report to the physician at the earliest so that correct management can be done.",

      "title": "Swallowing Disorders and Rehabilitation Techniques",
      "abstract": "Dysphagia may be defined as \"difficulty moving food from the mouth to the stomach\" (M. Donner, Dysphagia, 1, 1988) and encompasses impaired airway protection and problems with secretion management. There are a variety of neurological and neuromuscular conditions that can impair the oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing and cause dysphagia in infants and children. Neurologic conditions can be acute in onset (e.g. hemorrhagic, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, cerebral infarctions) or chronic (e.g. cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, encephalopathy, myopathy, neuropathy). There are various conditions that will cause neurogenic dysphagia that are also progressive in nature and can worsen in adulthood (e.g. Arnold-Chiari malformation, intracranial malignancies, dystonia, metabolic disorders, degenerative cortical conditions). These various conditions can progress rapidly or may be subtle and slow in their emergence. Symptoms of dysphagia in infants and children include: failure to thrive, meal-time distress, spitting, vomiting, choking, coughing and gagging during meals, refusing food, excessive oral secretions, oral-tactile hypersensitivity, aspiration-related respiratory conditions, and gastroesophageal or pharyngeal reflux. The ability to swallow, suck and breathe are completely developed at birth. Recent ultrasound studies of the fetus indicate that suckling is present between the 18th and 24th week and that by 34 weeks in-utero a regular burst-pause pattern of swallow is present. This burst-pause pattern together with a stable airway are prerequisites for normal infant feeding. By the time a child is between 18 to 24 months of age, independent self-feeding for most foods is well established. The normal anatomical and physiological development of the infant swallow will be presented and contrasted with the adult swallow. Conditions that impair this normal pattern of swallow will be presented and their symptoms discussed as they relate to infants and children. When problems persist beyond 6 months of age \"intervention usually is required to resolve difficulties with spoon feeding, cupdrinking, chewing, self-feeding skills and suckling\" (Sheppard, 1997, p.57). Table Feeding disorders and dysphagia in infants and children can be both physiological or behavioral in nature. If the child is unable to eat successfully or displays negative and aversive behaviors during mealtimes, problems in parent-child interactions may emerge that place unusual stresses on the family. Stress may contribute to creation of persistent behavioral abnormalities and aversive meal-times reactions. Therefore it is important that swallowing intervention is initiated as early as possible to avoid the pervasive problems that may occur in children who are not eating normally. A thorough medical/behavioral history and clinical feeding evaluation must be conducted before starting treatment. This evaluation should be family-centered and include observations during feeding. Because management of these children may be complicated, multidisciplinary team evaluations should be conducted. The members of this team may include pediatricians, gastroenterologists, neurologists, speech-language pathologists, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, radiologists, otalaryngologists, pharmacists and psychologists to develop a diagnosis and plan of management. Provision of treatment of dysphagia is usually conducted by the speech-language pathologist trained in pediatric dysphagia and includes: therapeutic strategies for nonnutritive oral stimulation, airway and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management, habilitation of feeding, drooling, nutritional and mealtime management techniques. For those children who have been intubated, management includes teaching techniques that will facilitate transitioning from nonoral to oral feeding. Successful rehabilitation of children with swallowing disorders requires knowledge of the parameters of normal and abnormal oral pharyngeal and esophageal swallowing plus skill in the integration of a variety of essential therapeutics techniques.",

When mild to moderate in intensity and expressed in constructive, nonhostile ways, anger can lead to positive, adaptive behaviors such as expressing feelings; asserting one's rights, thoughts, and feelings; problem solving; redressing concerns; setting appropriate limits on the behavior of others; and motivating effective behavior (1,2). Anger, however, is a double-edged sword, often leading to many negative outcomes. For example, chronic anger and hostility are associated with health problems such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, compromised immune functioning, dental problems, and overall mortality (3). Intense anger is often associated with marital discord, abusive parenting, intimate partner violence, and other relationship problems (4,5). Anger has also been implicated in school violence, bullying, and disrupted teen relations. Anger may also lead to major or minor property damage (4), and an overall propensity to aggression and violence (6). Anger is also associated with reduced work effectiveness and problems such as being placed on probation, demotion, and termination (7). For some angry individuals, their anger is totally externalized and entirely justified, leaving their sense of self untouched. For others, however, their anger impairs their sense ofpsychological well-being; they feel out of control and overwhelmed by their anger and feel anxious, embarrassed, guilty, ashamed, and depressed by their anger and anger-related reactions. While these are but a few examples, anger and its dysfunctional expression affects the physical, psychological, interpersonal, educational, and vocational lives of many people.",

      "title": "Vertigo",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

      "abstract": "Patients with chronic pain frequently experience concomitant sleep disorders. There has been controversy on whether opioids have a beneficial or deleterious effect on sleep quality, duration and efficiency. There is also concern regarding the association between chronic opioid therapy (COT) and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and the increased risk for unintentional opioid related overdose. This article provides a narrative review of the literature on the effect of opioids on sleep disorders and discusses risk assessment and mitigation strategies. A narrative review of the current literature on the effect of prescription opioids on sleep quality and efficiency, the relationship between opioids and sleep disorders and potential risk factors in patients with chronic pain. There is conflicting evidence regarding the benefit of opioids in improving sleep quality, duration and efficiency with several studies and reviews suggesting a beneficial effect of opioids on sleep and other studies demonstrating the opioids can cause sleep disturbance leading to hyperalgesia. There was credible evidence of a strong relationship between opioids and SDB with noted risk factors including use of methadone, high opioid dosing (>200 mg MED) and combining opioids with benzodiazepines. Further research is required to elucidate the effect of prescription opioids on sleep quality and pain intensity and the risks associated with opioids and SDB. The risk of SDB should be routinely assessed in patients on COT.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The core problem of addicts is addiction and not the other mental disorders that may be present. This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

      "abstract": "The Numbers of elderly people are gradually increasing in our society, and mood disorders are progressively increasing among older people. Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

      "title": "Introduction: Adenosine A <sub>2A</sub> receptors in nonlocomotor features of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Many symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the consequence of motor disability. However, there are clinical features that appear to be independent of motor impairment. For example, depression is a common problem, and patients tend to become passive and show little interest in daily activities. Sleep difficulties are also common in patients with PD, and sleep disruption appears to be related to disease progression. Other symptoms, such as some degree of orthostatic hypotension or constipation, may depend on autonomic dysfunction. Most patients receive treatment with drugs that improve symptoms but also produce side effects; therefore, it is difficult to separate problems associated with the progression of the disease from those caused by medication. For example, when used long term, the most widely used drug therapy, l-dopa, leads to a variety of severe complications, including dyskinesias, “on-off” fluctuations in drug effectiveness, and a number of psychiatric manifestations. Moreover, l-dopa efficacy generally decreases as the disease progresses.\n\nThe ideal new drug would arrest or even reverse the progression of the disease without the complications associated with existing medications. With this aim in mind, it is crucial to assess the potential of the emerging A2A receptor blockers with respect to all features of PD, not just those related to the impairment of the motor system. To achieve this, it is important to understand the …",

      "abstract": "The term transient global amnesia was first coined by Fisher and Adams in 1964 to describe a clinical syndrome characterised by the abrupt onset of severe amnesia usually accompanied by repetitive questioning, occurring in middle aged or elderly people, and lasting several hours.1 The aetiology of transient global amnesia has been a topic of debate, but in the past few years the situation has become considerably clearer with the emergence of the following diagnostic criteria: (1) attacks must be witnessed and information available from an observer who was present for most of the attack, (2) there must be clear cut anterograde amnesia during the attack, (3) clouding of consciousness and loss of personal identity must be absent and the cognitive impairment limited to amnesia, (4) there should be no accompanying focal neurological symptoms and functionally relevant focal signs, (5) epileptic features must be absent, (6) attacks must resolve within 24 hours, and (7) patients with recent head injury or known active epilepsy are excluded.2 3 Epidemiological studies which have applied these criteria have established that thromboembolic cerebrovascular disease plays no part in the causation of transient global amnesia, but the incidence of migraine in patients with transient global amnesia is greater than would be expected in the general population. A small minority of cases with unusually brief, and recurrent, attacks eventually manifest temporal lobe epilepsy.3 \n\nTurning to the neuropsychological aspects, much has been learned about the organisation and neural basis of human memory since the initial description of transient global amnesia. It is clear that memory is not a unitary function but consists of interactive systems.4 5 One broad distinction, which derives from experimental studies of patients with amnesia, is that between explicit and implicit memory; explicit memory refers to memory available to conscious access; implicit …",

A classificação das Porfirias é feita de acordo com a origem dos precursores em excesso, sendo, então, Porfirias Eritropoéticas ou Hepáticas. Também podem ser classificadas em Agudas e Crônicas, de acordo com as manifestações clínicas. Assim, sintomas neuropsiquiátricos, dores abdominais, vômitos, neuropatia aguda, convulsões e distúrbios mentais como alucinações, depressão, paranoia e ansiedades são referentes ao aspecto agudo. Já em casos crônicos, a manifestação clínica se dá sob a forma de fotossensibilidade cutânea. O tratamento é realizado após a descoberta dos sintomas.

Sleepiness is experienced as a subjective difficulty maintaining alertness accompanied by a rapid entrance into sleep when the person is sedentary. Often this leads to decrements in quality-of-life, cognitive impairment, and increased accidents (2,3). Each year in the United States greater than 50,000motor vehicle accidents are attributed to driving while drowsy (4). Sleepiness has many causes including insufficient sleep, sleep disorders, medical and neurological illness, and medication side effects. This chapter focuses on sleep disorders where excessive sleepiness is the primary symptom; this includes narcolepsy (sporadic and secondary), idiopathic hypersomnia, hypersomnia due to medical conditions (posttraumatic hypersomnia), recurrent hypersomnia, and behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual dysfunction, usually involving short-term memory, abstract reasoning, visuomotor coordination, intellectual flexibility, and spatial reasoning, is a well-documented finding among alcohol imbibers of various drinking styles. Despite the diversity of groups examined and the attempted control of variables other than alcohol consumption, little concensus has been reached with regard to the chronology of dysfunction (as related to lifetime drinking style, duration of alcoholism, quantity consumed per session, or type of potable). In many instances, diet, age, and even sex have outweighed the relative influence of alcohol in the degree of intellectual dysfunction. Morphologically, brain changes tend to be in the anterior/basal areas and may involve the third ventricle, diencephalic areas, and other focal variations. Cerebellar changes also are not uncommon yet may reflect a subgroup of alcoholics rather than a generalised trend. Generally, many intellectual deficits partially rebound rapidly within the first two or three weeks after cessation of drinking, with perhaps modest further improvement if sobriety is sustained for several months. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the alcoholic population and the potent effect of ancillary variables upon measures of intellectual functioning, control and matching of demographic factors is a paramount consideration. Demographic variables of primary concern include age, sex, socio-economic status, education, duration of alcoholism, quantity of alcohol consumed per session, diet, psychotropic medications, secondary psychiatric diagnoses, secondary medical diagnoses, exact duration of abstinence, and prior exposure to psychometric instruments.",

This is why we attempted to find the origin of acute opium-addicted psychoses during the detoxification period. The results of our research showed that acute psychoses of opium addicts appear on the third or fourth day (like in alcoholics). However, acute psychoses appear only after patients enter the psychiatric ward. The cause of the opium-addicted psychoses is drug-induced. The course of such psychoses is transitory and abortive. The clinical forms of both alcoholic and opium-addicted psychoses are the same: delirium, hallucinations, and paranoia. The difference is that the opium-addicted psychoses are shorter than alcoholic psychoses. Opioid abstinence syndrome is the necessary condition for the beginning of this drug-induced opium-addicted psychoses.",

In unplanned complex suicides the mode of performance is changed after the first method chosen failed or was working too slow or proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g. ingestion of medicines, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, fall from a height) are combined. But also unusual combinations have been described such as the simultaneous firing of two guns, self-immolation in combination with other suicide methods or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height.

Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice the most important of these interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the metabolic and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The mechanisms and practical consequences of the clinically most important influences of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of drugs are outlined.",

Stress or disruption of the normal functioning of these structures can lead to the formation of abstinence syndrome, affective disorders in remission and craving for alcohol. Dopaminergic and opioid (endorphin) system play an important role in the genesis of various mental and motor disorders. In some way alcohol dependence can be regarded as an endorfinodefitsitnoe disease with a pathogenetic point of view. Activating of opioidereal system by trans-cranial electrical stimulation promotes the restoration of disturbed emotional, cognitive and autonomic functions, reduces craving for alcohol and in that way increases the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatment",

Hippocampal sclerosis is the consequence of a cerebral aggression during early childhood, called the initial precipitating event, the most frequent of which are: febrile seizure, intracranial infection, hypoxia, or cranial trauma. The epilepsy onset usually occurs a few years after this event, with an association of focal temporal seizures and rarer secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Most patients have a drug-resistant focal epilepsy, with a failure of two different and adequate antiepileptic drugs to achieve seizure freedom. Patients also demonstrated with cognitive impairment, with a typical episodic memory impairment affecting both verbal and non-verbal episodic memory. Cognitive impairment is however more diffuse than the sole episodic memory impairment, and also affects language, visuo-spatial processing, and executive functions. With aging, subjects demonstrated a progressive cognitive decline, that appears to parallel the decline associated with normal aging, but starts earlier and from a lower global cognitive functioning with less cognitive reserve. Patients may therefore reach an impairment threshold sooner than healthy subjects, and are much more vulnerable to any other disease that impairs cognitive functioning. Patients exhibited cortical and subcortical atrophy patterns on volumetric brain MRI similar to normal aging in its distribution, but with an earlier pattern of atrophy (4.5 years sooner in patients than in healthy subjects). Hippocampal sclerosis is associated with amyloid and tau deposits inside the hippocampus, which increases with the subjects’ age. Those deposits pattern is close to the one observed in patients with tau / amyloïd neurodegenerative diseases, which demonstrates a bilateral relationship between epilepsy, hippocampal sclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical consequences of such a relationship are yet to be precisely determined.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

There are many different opioid agents available that differ in their potency, onset and duration of action, metabolism, drug interactions, and side-effect profile. All opioids have distinct effects upon various organ systems, including central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, and decreased gastrointestinal motility. Fentanyl and fentanyl-derived agents (alfentanil, sufentanil, remifentanil) are most frequently used in the intraoperative period due to their quick onset and duration of action, allowing them to be easily titrated and discontinued at the completion of a procedure. Oral opioids with moderate durations of action, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine, are commonly used for acute pain management in the postoperative setting. When oral analgesics cannot be used, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia is another option for pain management. This review contains 5 figures, 11 tables, and 59 references.

A further reason is that the ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for psychotropic substance abuse and dependence are not easy to apply to medically prescribed substances.",

      "title": "The management of a first seizure-Still a major debate",
      "abstract": "A child or an adult who presents to the treating physician with a first epileptic seizure faces a number of problems, which require a correct diagnostic and therapeutic management. First of all, epileptic seizures must be clearly differentiated from other paroxysmal events, which have a different prognosis and imply a different therapeutic approach. Second, epileptic seizures are stereotyped episodic manifestations, which tend to recur at any age at an unpredictable rate in the large majority of cases. Third, the etiology of seizures is diverse and may affect the chance of recurrence to a different extent. The timing of the seizure and the removal of the offending agent may strongly predict the risk of recurrence. Fourth, in many patients, seizures tend to remain isolated and, for this reason, drug treatment may not be justified as drugs may cause significant adverse effects and, for most recent compounds, have a high cost. Fifth, although rarely life threatening, seizures expose an individual to environmental risks and limit his/her autonomy and socioeconomic efficiency. Sixth, seizures may interfere with several personal choices (school, professional activities, driving, pregnancy, etc.) and thus have a significant impact on one's quality of life. Seventh, the seizure may represent a medical emergency, or at least it may be perceived as such, and trigger emergency interventions and raise concerns about the need of chronic treatment. Last, seizures may occur in patients with comorbidities treated with drugs potentially interfering with antiepileptic medication. When a patient presents with a first seizure, the caring physician has thus to address several clinical questions. These include: (a) the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure; (b) the relationship between a seizure and any underlying epileptogenic condition; (c) the risk of recurrence of the seizure; (d) the impact of treatment on this risk and on the long-term prognosis of epilepsy; (e) the risk:benefit ratio of pharmacological treatment; and (f) the sociocultural, emotional, and legal implications of seizure recurrence compared with the tolerability and acceptance of chronic therapy. A considerable amount of data has been made available by several investigators to the benefit of physicians and patients who are asked to address this specific issue in clinical practice. Some of these data are sufficiently robust to influence diagnostic and therapeutic choices. However, there are still several unanswered questions, which justify decisions to be taken on a patient-per-patient basis. All the questions to be addressed by the treating physician in a patient with a first seizure will be discussed in detail by the most authoritative scientists in the field who generously accepted my invitation to contribute to the preparation of this supplement. Each scientist was asked to provide an overview of the available knowledge and to translate scientific data into practical recommendations. Separate chapters have been dedicated to the differential diagnosis between seizures and other paroxysmal events, the correct use of definitions, the risks and the predictors of recurrence of a first seizure, the diagnostic and prognostic contribution of EEG and neuroimaging, the benefits and the risks of treatment with antiepileptic drugs, the socioeconomic, cultural and emotional implications of the seizure and its treatment, and the problems posed by special populations (children, adults, and the elderly). In addition, the management of a first seizure has been illustrated under an evidence-based medicine perspective. Finally, I tried to summarize the most relevant conclusions of each contribution and translate them into recommendations for the caring physician. I hope this supplement can be considered of practical utility to the epileptologist, the child neurologist, the neurologist, and even the general practitioner, who may find here answers to their questions and ultimately arrive at the best management of their patient, from a medical, personal, and societal viewpoint.

Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

It has been reported in the available literature 1,2 that the administration of levodopa might cause psychiatric symptoms (eg, hallucinations, ideas of reference, or irritability) as untoward side effects. Our own experience indicates that levodopa aggravates the mental status of patients with chronic schizophrenia with drug-induced parkinsonism. 3 We have also found that levodopa increased the severity of depression in two patients with Parkinson's disease and caused auditory and visual hallucinations in one patient without previous mental illness. A decrease or gradual withdrawal of levodopa resulted in the disappearance of psychiatric symptoms in all three patients. These findings could be in agreement with those biochemical theories of schizophrenia where biogenic amines metabolism seems to play a preponderant role. 4 As this",

Existem diferentes etiologias para a epilepsia, caracterizando um tratamento variado de acordo com a particularidade do indivíduo, o que acentua a polifarmácia. Objetivo: Avaliar a polifarmácia relacionada ao tratamento da epilepsia na rede pública brasileira, reconhecendo o uso exacerbado ou inapropriado de medicações. Metodologia: Trata-se de uma revisão integrativa de literatura realizada entre os meses de abril e junho de 2022 nas seguintes bases de dados: National Library of Medicine (PubMed MEDLINE), Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Google Scholar, Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS) e EBSCO Information Services. Resultados e discussão: Cerca de 50% dos pacientes com epilepsia consomem múltiplos medicamentos, o que eleva a morbimortalidade devido aos riscos dos efeitos adversos e a capacidade de aumentar as crises epilépticas. A epilepsia propicia a autointoxicação em consequência à polifarmácia, principalmente de idosos, pelas interações farmacológicas, devendo ser monitoras pelos médicos. O Sistema Único de Saúde do Brasil possui assistência farmacêutica que promove o uso racional de medicamentos, buscando selecionar e padronizar os medicamentos que são indicados e disponibilizados. Considerações finais: Os pacientes epilépticos em uso de polifarmácia tendem a desenvolver problemas que atrapalham o desempenho psicossocial e apresentam maior risco de efeitos adversos pelas interações farmacológicas. Portanto, torna-se necessário o uso farmacológico racional pelo balancear dos benefícios e das desvantagens.",

      "title": "Fatty acid oxidation defects as a cause of neuromyopathic disease in infants and adults.",
      "abstract": "Fatty acids are a major fuel for the body and fatty acid oxidation is particularly important during fasting, sustained aerobic exercise & stress. The myocardium and resting skeletal muscle utilise long-chain fatty acids as a major source of energy. Inherited disorders of fatty acid oxidation seriously compromise the function of muscle and other highly energy-dependent tissues such as brain, nerve, heart, kidney & liver. Defects of fatty acid oxidation lead to a range of neuromyopathic disease in both adults and children. Such defects encompass a wide spectrum of clinical disease, presenting in the neonatal period or infancy with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, liver dysfunction and hyperammonaemia with neurosensory deficits secondary to the acute onset. In addition, there may be cardiac arrhythmias and/or progressive cardiomyopathy, which may give rise to secondary hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. In older children, adolescence or adults there is often exercise intolerance with episodic myalgia or rhabdomyolysis in association with prolonged aerobic exercise or other exacerbating factors. Some disorders are particularly associated with toxic metabolites that may contribute to encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, axonopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. Diagnosis is through clinical suspicion with appropriate investigations in blood and urine taken during crisis. Definitive diagnosis is usually by fibroblast assay. Treatment is generally through avoidance of fasting, frequent carbohydrate rich feeds and in long-chain defects MCT supplementation. Novel treatments include the use of D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate and the potential use of fibrates to increase mutant protein levels in mild disorders.",

      "abstract": "Los analgésicos opioides son eficaces en el alivio del dolor crónico no oncológico (DCNO). Sin embargo, en tratamiento a largo plazo genera tolerancia, dependencia física y riesgo de desarrollar adicción. Estos fenómenos son causados por el efecto agonista en los receptores opioides que modulan las vías del dolor y producen un efecto hedónico intenso en el sistema de recompensa cerebral. La exposición repetida a opioides produce neuroadaptación que disminuye el efecto analgésico, produce anhedonia, aparición síntomas de abstinencia y cambios conductuales que pueden gatillar abuso y dependencia. El conocimiento actual nos permite entender la dependencia a opioides como una enfermedad cerebral de origen multifactorial. En pacientes con DCNO se ha podido establecer que el riesgo a desarrollar una adicción a opioides aumenta cuando hay antecedentes de abuso y dependencia a sustancias, presencia de psicomorbilidades, un ambiente social favorecedor al consumo, y cuando se prescriben dosis superiores a 120 mg de morfina equivalente al día (MME). Por otra parte, el aumento de la prescripción indiscriminada de estos fármacos ha causado graves consecuencias en la población general en muchos países, incrementando la poblacion dependiente, la mortalidad por sobredosis de opioides y el tráfico a nivel mundial. Guías clínicas basadas en la evidencia y consenso de expertos recomiendan que los opioides en DCNO deben ser parte de un manejo multidisciplinario, ponderando la presencia de factores de riesgo y el beneficio esperado. Aunque es difícil demostrar con evidencia que estas recomendaciones tengan impacto en reducir el riesgo, todas dan énfasis en estrategias de prevención, pesquisa precoz y seguimiento específico para el uso de estos fármacos. Opioids on long-term therapy are effective in chronic non-cancer pain(CNCP) relief. However, they generate tolerance, physical dependence and risk of developing addiction. These phenomena are produced by agonist effect on opioid receptors of pain pathways and a hedonic stimulation on brain reward circuitry. Neuroadaptations to long-term opioids exposure results in reduction analgesic effects, anhedonia, withdrawal symptoms and could trigger behaviors for abuse and dependence. Current knowledge let us understanding opioids addiction as a multifactorial brain disorder. History of substance abuse and dependence, mental health disorders, permissive social environment for drugs consumption, and higher than 120 mg morphine equivalent diary doses, have been found as risk factors for developing opioids prescription dependence. Furtheremore uncontrolled rise of indiscriminated opioids prescriptions has caused serious consequences in general population, raising addiction prevalence, overdose deaths and traffic worldwide. Evidence-based Guidelines and Consensus-based Treatments recommend that opioids must be part of a multidisciplinary management and balance risk factors with benefits. Altought the lacking evidence of reducing risk, these guidelines enfatize on specifics prevention, monitoring and follow-up strategies for long-term opioids prescribing.",

Peripheral neuropathy is a rare adverse effect associated with isoniazid, and it occurs after the prolonged use of this drug [1]. This usually presents with paresthesias which can be accompanied by muscle aches, occasionally muscular weakness, and can progress to more severe symptoms such as ataxia [1]. Risk factors for developing neuropathy after isoniazid therapy include old age, slow acetylator status, diabetes, renal failure, alcoholism, malnutrition, HIV infection, chronic hepatic failure and pregnancy [1]. Here we report a case of acute isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy with predominant motor functional impairment associated with tetraplegia. To our knowledge, there has been no report of a patient who developed severe peripheral neuropathy barely 2 weeks after the initial administration of conventional doses of isoniazid. This atypical clinical course should be known in order to improve the outcome of adverse events due to antituberculosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "Along with ages, elderly patients with comorbid who undergoing surgical procedures are more likely to experience cognitive disorders such as decreased quality of life and loss of independence. This is known as postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The percentage is quite significant for old age to experience cognitive disorders. Ages, education level, health and mental status can be a factor causing cognitive disorders. Comprehensive assessment of objective mental, social and functional status can increase patient preoperative. Perioperative pharmacological management can reduce the incidence of POCD. For example, minimal use of propofol in spinal anesthesia may reduce POCD in hip fracture surgery. The use of dexmedetomidine in ventilated patients in the ICU may also reduce POCD. The etiology is still unclear, but there is a suspicion that the use of neurotoxic anesthetics can trigger the occurrence of POCD, but this has not been further proven.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychological and neuropathological research of the brain is on the rise and is discovering interesting phenomena for science. Dysarthria is a disorder that occurs as a result of a brain condition that often makes it very difficult to articulate sounds and pronounce words, leading to impairments in the intelligibility, audibility, naturalness and efficiency of vocal communication. There are many potential causes of dysarthria. These include toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, or thrombotic or embolic stroke. Central or peripheral neurological lesions can lead to paralysis or a lack of coordination of the verbo-motor system, producing severe speech disorders, which in turn prevent control over the tongue, throat, lips or lungs; for example, swallowing (dysphagia) and mastication problems. Dysarthria is different from verbal apraxia, it does not include speech disorders generated by structural anomalies (malformations). The symptomatology is very diverse, depending on the intensity of the neuronal damage, which is correlated with the etiology, which includes toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injuries or thrombotic or embolic stroke. From the perspective of the location of the lesion on the brain, the classification of dysarthria is presented, and the forms are described.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

Poststroke dementia or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSD/PSCI) is a form of cognitive disturbance caused by cerebrovascular disease that can manifest at different times after a stroke, including during the acute phase of stroke, during the recovery phase (while motor stroke symptoms improve), or months and years later. The onset of cognitive impairment depends on the location of infarct. Infarct in certain locations have cognitive impairment as a sole presentation from the outset. Infarcts in the left frontotemporal lobes, right parietal lobe, and left thalamus are notably correlated with cognitive impairment following a stroke. In the former, patients present with complains of motor difculties as the main complain. In addition to these locations, vascular lesions in the thalamo-perforating area of the PCAmay cause dementia and other forms of severe memory loss. Abaseline (pre-morbid) and early post-stroke (early post-morbid) cognitive status should be evaluated and a protocol for the same is needed in regular clinical and ICU care facilities. MoCA assessment is commonly used for cognitive assessment. Its role in strategic infarcts is undermined as it leaves out the evaluation of symptoms corresponding to common strategic infarct locations such as the medial temporal lobe and thalami. There is a need for dedicated neuropsychological assessment score based on education level, and native-language for PSCI.",

Se define como como un trastorno cronico potencialmente recurrente, caracterizado por una compulsion por la busqueda del alcohol, una perdida sobre el control de su consumo, asi como por la manifestacion de un malestar significativo ante la ausencia del mismo e implicando profundos cambios en distintos sistemas de neurotransmision y procesos de neuroplasticidad cerebral, si bien estos mecanismos son aun objeto de estudio. El TUA suele coexistir con trastornos del estado de animo como la depresion, una condicion que ademas empeora el curso de ambas patologias. Por esta razon, los farmacos antidepresivos se utilizan con frecuencia en estos pacientes. No obstante, debido a algunas limitaciones metodologicas, la evidencia sobre la eficacia del tratamiento antidepresivo en pacientes comorbidos es, hasta la fecha, inconcluyente, principalmente en lo que respecta a sus efectos sobre aspectos relacionados con la recaida en el consumo.\nLa presente tesis doctoral busca analizar los efectos que el tratamiento con distintos antidepresivos (fluoxetina, un inhibidor selectivo de la recaptacion de serotonina; el bupropion, un inhibidor de la recaptacion de dopamina y noradrenalina; y la reboxetina, un inhibidor selectivo de la recaptacion de noradrenalina), administrados durante la abstinencia, ejercen sobre los niveles de consumo de alcohol en la recaida en un modelo animal (Rata Wistar) de auto-administracion operante de alcohol. Ademas, busca analizar las posibles alteraciones en los niveles de ARNm y proteina de los principales receptores y enzimas de los sistemas endocannabinoide y glutamatergico, sistemas que participan en procesos de neuroplasticidad, que habrian tenido lugar en las regiones cerebrales relacionadas con el consumo de alcohol de estos animales. Finalmente, desde un enfoque teorico, busca analizar la implicacion de los procesos de neurogenesis en el hipocampo sobre los efectos del tratamiento antidepresivo en el TUA.\nLos resultados muestran que los animales que recibieron tratamiento con fluoxetina y reboxetina incrementaron su consumo durante la recaida, algo que no se observo en los animales tratados con bupropion. Ademas, observamos que los animales tratados con antidepresivos presentan cambios en los niveles de ARNm y densidad de proteina que parecen reflejar un estado de hiperexcitabilidad glutamatergica acompanado de una desactivacion en la modulacion de la neurotransmision del sistema endocannabinoide, y que algunas alteraciones especificas, como el marcado aumento en la expresion del receptor CB2 en los animales que tratados con fluoxetina, podrian subyacer a los patrones de recaida observados. Finalmente, proponemos el estudio de la neurogenesis en el hipocampo, y su participacion en los efectos que el tratamiento antidepresivo ejerceria sobre la recuperacion del consumo de alcohol, como una fuente de investigacion de cara a futuros estudios.",

Assimilated to addiction, some inappropriate and compulsive ways to modify body shape (dieting, and anabolic steroid abuse) are seen in teenagers although they are difficult to identify. Prevention and treatment in youths requires a pragmatic attitude from the adults, avoiding minimisation or dramatization of drug use and its consequences. Particular attention has to be paid on the detection of underlying psychiatric disorders. Treatment of problematic drug abuse in adolescents is based on both contextual interventions including systematic support of the families and a multidisciplinary approach.",

      "title": "Retrograde Amnesia – A Question of Disturbed Calcium Levels?",
      "abstract": "Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer’s disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca 2+ extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca 2+ signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of psychoses increases with age with a number of factors leading to the increase in vulnerability and expression. They include comorbid physical illnesses, social isolation, sensory deficits, cognitive changes, polypharmacy, and substance abuse. Agitation and aggressiveness are also associated with psychosis in the elderly and frequently are the precipitating reasons for psychiatric consultation. A review of psychoses in the elderly must, therefore, consider psychotic symptoms within the context of the underlying etiologies of the psychotic symptoms. Elderly patients who present with psychotic symptoms require social, behavioral, and environmental interventions that are necessary for their safety and orientation. Given the likelihood of comorbid medical disorders and concomitant medications, the mere presence of delusions or hallucinations is not always an indication for additional medications. However, some patients may need pharmacologic intervention in order to manage the behavioral disturbance that often results from the psychotic symptoms. The atypical antipsychotics with their low propensity to produce extrapyramidal and cognitive side effects have greatly advanced the pharmacotherapy for elderly patients with psychoses.",

While both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs are able to diminish manic symptoms, agitation and aggression in acute mania, the atypical antipsychotic drugs enjoy a number of advantages, including significantly less extrapyramidal symptoms, diminished risk of tardive dyskinesia, lack of increase in serum prolactin levels (with the exception of risperidone), improvement in cognition, and possible decrease in suicidality. Most of the atypical antipsychotic drugs have been found to be effective as an add-on treatment (with mood stabilizers and antidepressant drugs) and sometimes as monotherapy in treatment-resistant bipolar patients. Long-acting typical neuroleptic drugs may be useful in the treatment of non-compliant bipolar patients. A small number of patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine experience a first episode of hypomania or mania. It is not apparent if this is a true drug-induced event or coincidental. Side-effects of note with the atypical antipsychotic drugs are weight gain (most prominently with olanzapine and clozapine), sedation, and agranulocytosis (clozapine). Atypical antipsychotic drugs are recommended for use in bipolar disorder for acute treatment, maintenance treatment, and for treatment-resistant patients.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a disease that alters the behaving and thinking of the brain of a person. When a person starts using drugs, it starts getting addicted to them and gradually it can’t help but act on the impulse to use them regardless of the damage caused to the body of addicted person. Drug isn’t about just illegal drugs. A person can get addicted to alcohol, painkillers, nicotine and other legal substances. Drug addiction is a deathly disease found in almost every year of age. The disease is mostly carried by people who are mentally frustrated, physically or mentally abused, facing financial problem or family problems and is desperate to get some sort of relief that comes with the high of drugs even if it proves to be grim for their health in the long run. Addiction starts with the continuous use of dosage of any drug, until the point that an individual starts feeling anxious without the availability of them. Slowly and painfully, these drugs starts making a person totally relied on them and it is basically impossible for the individual to survive without them. There can be many reasons as to why an individual decides to go on this path of addiction. Economic problems, state of utter sadness in case of the death of a loved one or a closed one, societal stress, isolation, aggression, bad or wrong company, in state of depression and anxiety are the most likely situations in which a person starts taking drugs. Along with many other factors, families often play a vital role in pushing an individual towards seeking comfort and relief from the drugs. Developing countries like Pakistan and many others are facing the problem as there are not many effective and active rehabilitation centers. In this research article, the role of families contributing in an individual’s drug addiction is elaborated. This research article is done with the help of many researches, as well as some interviews were conducted regarding certain factors and the answers were given according to the observation and views of responders. The conclusion is drawn with the help of articles and personal opinions and observations regarding how a person leans toward substance or drug usage because of certain family issues and problems.",

Such difficulties can include problems with the placement and manipulation of food in the oral cavity or the physiology of swallowing, or both, and are referred to as dysphagia. Swallowing is a highly complex motor process, requiring neurological control and coordination of breathing and swallowing. Cerebral damage may affect the neurological control of swallowing (Murdoch and Theodoros 2001) and consequently, the child is at increased risk of fluids and food material entering the airway, termed aspiration. According to Reilly et al. (2000) the signs suggestive of aspiration include coughing, choking or deterioration in respiratory status during a feed, noisy or wet breathing, or excessive pharyngeal secretions; sneezing during drinking may also indicate nasopharyngeal incoordination and reflux.",

Há controvérsia sobre quando se introduzir esta droga mas deve-se reservá-la para quando surgir substancial comprometimento funcional. Drogas acessórias são anticolinérgicos, úteis para o tremor; amantadina, para bradicinesia e rigidez; e agonistas dopaminérgicos que ajudam no manuseio de complicações da levodopa.

A falha primária pode ser causada por uso de agentes antidopaminérgicos, presença de tremor de repouso severo ou erro diagnóstico. A causa mais comum de falha secundária é progressão da DP. As principais complicações do uso da levodopa são flutuações e discinesias. Outros problemas comuns são disautonomia, depressão, psicose e demência.

      "abstract": "Individuals suffering from mental illnesses, unfortunately, have a shorter lifespan. An increase in mortality rates is primarily due to physical illness, unhealthy lifestyle, and associated comorbidities. Antipsychotic medications, previously known as tranquilizers, antipsychotics, or neuroleptics, can alleviate or attenuate symptoms related to psychosis, delusion, and/or hallucinations and are used in the treatment of psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or Alzheimer's disease. Within hours to days, these medications alleviate symptoms and reduce confusion in individuals with psychosis; however, the full effect may take longer than usual in some cases. Importantly, these drugs do not cure the disease, but only treat the symptoms of the disease. The treatment is adjusted to reduce any psychotic symptoms while keeping the adverse effects to a minimum level. Antipsychotics may lead to increased risk of diseases, including but not limited to, diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular, renal, or respiratory disorders. Improved dosages, polypharmacy, and age-specific treatment play an important role in limiting the comorbidities, as well as the side effects. Further research and clinical attention are required to understand the functioning of these medications. The review focuses on the use of antipsychotic medications in different diseases and their effect on mental health.",

Obsessions are recurrent and persistent intrusive, unwanted thoughts, urges, or images that cause marked anxiety or distress. Examples of obsessions include worrying about germs, the feeling things need to be “just right,” worrying about bad things happening, and disturbing thoughts or images about hurting others. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels compelled to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Examples of compulsions include washing, checking, tapping, ordering, and repeating. Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these repetitive behaviors or mental acts.

Its main symptoms are tremor at rest muscle stiffness and bradykinesia, i.e. slowness of movement (the so-called parkinsonian triad). Atrophic lessons of substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, responsible for the production of dopamine, contribute to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Patients with Parkinson’s diseases suffer from a variety of extra-motor symptoms often psychiatric disorders, especially panic or generalized anxiety. The author presents the case of 63 years old man diagnosed with Parkinson’s diseases 4 years ago, with quite a significant severity in the last 2 years. Left limb weakness (upper and lower) deepened and general slowing of movement developed then restless legs syndrome developed fully (specific sensations in the area of the feet and lower legs in the evening and night hours, temporarily decreasing when moving, walking, stretching the muscles). For about 6 months he have had attacks of anxiety and anxiety as well as a fully developed generalized anxiety disorder. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa and pregabalin was used, resulting in a reduction of slowness and stiffness as well as a significant reduction in anxiety and anxiety after approximately 8 weeks.",

The most frequently occurring dopaminergic dysfunction is associated with Parkinson's disease, caused by the progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (1). Although the etiology of affective psychoses, addictions to cocaine or alcohol, and hypertension are less well understood, a large body of clinical and experimental observations document that changes occur in dopamine mechanisms in these disorders (2,3). One of the prevalent treatments for dopaminergic dysfunctions is the use of exogenous dopamine replacement/attenuation therapies in modern neurology and psychiatry to activate/block dopamine receptors. This type of intervention is prescribed whether or not the dopaminergic system has a direct etiology for the disorder, for example, Huntington's disease (4), schizophrenia (5), addiction (6), and stress (7) in addition to the well-established regimen of L-DOPA precursor treatment for amelioration of the symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neuropsychiatric pathology characterized by dysfunctions in the frontal lobe of the brain, especially in planning, execution, and inhibition tasks, with an inability to make decisions and handle different sequences, also affecting the temporal lobe. The patient presents alterations to store, consolidate, and recall information. These neurocognitive deficits are accompanied by neurobehavioral disorders such as depression, anxiety, and apathy that contribute to the worsening of the quality of life, with a high impact on the individual, social, and family level. To identify the neurobehavioral disorders and neurocognitive deterioration that present a patient diagnosed with FTD: clinical case of low incidence and prevalence disease in Colombia. A 40-year-old man, with progressive deterioration of his immediate verbal memory, low verbal fluency, aberrant motor behavior, sexual impulsivity, alterations in his executive functions, especially in planning tasks, decision-making, and inhibition was found to have a lesser degree of affectation in his visuospatial functioning and visuoconstructive abilities. It was found that the patient presents a severe dysexecutive syndrome associated with a clinical picture of FTD, correlated with an inability to process and recall information, accompanied by disorders such as depression, anxiety, and apathy. It is necessary to generate a functional neurorehabilitation plan that aims to improve the quality of life in these patients. In the same way, it is necessary to create new lines of research and intervention that have the purpose to create a greater field of heuristics or new questions in this type of neurodegenerative pathologies.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Management of epilepsy in the elderly requires understanding of the unique biochemical and pharmacologic characteristics of this patient population. Accurate assessment of seizures and identification of epilepsy syndromes, thorough neurologic assessment to define etiology, and comprehensive evaluation of the patient's health and living situation are necessary for informed management decisions. Challenges to treatment include concomitant diseases, polypharmacy with accompanying drug interactions, and changes in physiology, such as changes in renal clearance and hepatic function that alter drug absorption, protein binding, metabolism, and elimination. Elderly patients with declining intellectual function, motor impairment, or altered sensory function may be especially susceptible to dose‐related CNS side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Drugs pre‐scribed for concomitant illnesses such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, infections, behavioral problems, and gastrointestinal disturbances may alter absorption, distribution, and metabolism of AEDs, with an adverse impact on efficacy and increased occurrence of adverse effects. The AEDs may induce metabolism of other drugs, resulting in decline in target response. Addition of an AED to an elderly patient's medical regimen requires careful review of all prescribed drugs. Optimal care of elderly patients with epilepsy includes use of free drug levels to monitor AED concentrations, careful dose selection, and sensitivity to the social problems that may occur in this population.",

With this information, physicians may expedite treatment with opioid antagonists (naloxone), which help patients to resume spontaneous respiration. Because the drug level does not always correlate with the severity of illness, quantitative drug levels are rarely needed. Hypoglycemia, hypoxia, and hypothermia are also seen with opioid overdose.",

      "title": "Newer oral atypical antipsychotic agents: a review.",
      "abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs are commonly prescribed for a variety of psychiatric conditions. In addition to individuals with schizophrenia, the original target patient population, several antipsychotic medications are widely used for bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, delirium, insomnia, agitation, and aggression in various patient types. Despite their important role in the treatment of psychotic and other illnesses, these medications have some shortcomings. Some patients with psychosis fail to respond to treatment, or they may respond incompletely. Some patients experience neurological events such as extrapyramidal side effects or, more rarely, tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is another rare but potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with antipsychotic drugs.\r\n\r\nRecently, the antipsychotic medications (particularly the atypical, “second-generation” antipsychotics) have come under scrutiny because of an increased risk of weight gain and metabolic adverse effects (AEs), such as glucose intolerance and lipid abnormalities. These AEs have the potential to increase the risk of type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease as well as morbidity and mortality rates related to these conditions.1 Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed “off-label” for the management of agitation and psychosis in patients with dementia without an approved FDA indication. The use of these medications in elderly dementia patients has become controversial and has been reported by the FDA to increase the risk of cerebrovascular events as well as the all-cause death rate among these patients, leading to the advent of “black-box” warnings for all antipsychotic drugs.2\r\n\r\nAntipsychotic agents may be classified in several ways. Commonly, they can be designated as older drugs (often called conventional or “typical” antipsychotics) and newer “atypicals.” The term atypical refers to the perceived lower likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms, a sequela that had been deemed characteristic of the first generation of antipsychotic drugs. The atypicals are widely prescribed based on the perception that they are more effective and produce fewer side effects than the typicals, even though some atypicals are much more expensive.\r\n\r\nCATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness), a large study published in 2005, cast doubt on the relative overall effectiveness of the atypicals, which seemed to perform no better than perphenazine (formerly Trilafon, Schering-Plough), an older, less expensive typical antipsychotic medication.3 Some observers have suggested a return to the use of the less expensive typical medications. In this setting, the field is in need of better agents to bring about improved antipsychotic effects, a lower rate of refractory illness, and reduced both metabolic and neurological side effects.\r\n\r\nThe atypical antipsychotics include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), and aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka). Clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis) is usually included in this list as the prototypical agent, although its potential for bone marrow suppression sets it apart.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of aripiprazole in 2002, there has been a relative hiatus in the development of new atypical antipsychotic drugs. In this article, we review four oral atypical antipsychotic agents introduced since 2007: paliperidone (Invega, Ortho-McNeil-Janssen), iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda), asenapine (Saphris, Organon), and lurasidone (Latuda, Sunovion). We discuss their classification, indications, mechanism of action, clinical trials, efficacy, adverse effects, comparisons with other antipsychotics, new indications being sought, dosing and administration, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, contraindications, FDA warnings, and drug–drug interactions. We excluded antipsychotic agents that are currently under investigation and those that have not yet been approved by the FDA.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a Medline search for the terms paliperidone, iloperidone, asenapine, and lurasidone to identify efficacy and tolerability trials for each drug. Product information and results from unpublished studies were obtained from the manufacturers.",

      "abstract": "Regarding the treatment of insomnia, it is said that a considerable degree of advancement has been made to date in terms of controlling toxicity, preventing the development of tolerance and avoiding addiction, which were often observed when administering barbiturates. Nevertheless, the majority of hypnotics used today, which are benzodiazepines, still retain certain side effects such as hangover effects, development of dependence, rebound insomnia as a withdrawal symptom, muscular atonia resulting in falling down and causing bone fracture, inhibition of respiratory system, negative interaction with alcohol, etc. The current trend of selecting hypnotics is to use short-half-life agents. However, there are yet other problems such as cognitive disorders including amnesia, rebound insomnia and increased anxiety during the daytime. In order to cope with these problems, three new hypnotics have recently been developed. They are non-benzodiazepine derivatives and considered to be safer than the others, because they are supposed to cause less side effects than conventional hypnotics. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these new hypnotics can be summarized as follows: 1) these hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega-1 subtype although the agent itself does not belong to the benzodiazepine derivative family; 2) the half-life-time in the serum is extremely short, namely 1-2 hours; 3) they increase the level of slow waves (delta-wave) during sleep; 4) they have a lesser effect toward atonic muscle and amnestic thought and behavioral disturbance as compared to conventional hypnotics; and 5) the risks of developing drug tolerance and reciprocal negative effects with alcohol are smaller. Consequently, we can expect that these new hypnotics will bring a certain advantage, especially regarding the avoidance of hypnotics-induced side effects in the course of clinical treatment of insomnia in the future.",

Case presentation The case of a 14 year old boy with bipolar affective disorder, autism and intellectual disability who had brand-name to generic olanzapine switch associated with rapid deterioration of his mental state is described. This clinical change was not related to any physical illness or other medication adjustment and resolved as rapidly when generic olanzapine was switched back to the brand-name formulation. Conclusions Caution should be exercised when policy for switching from brand-name to generic psychotropic medications are made, especially when using medications off label, in extremes of age and in those patients with co-morbid complicating factors such as intellectual disability.",

      "title": "Olanzapine-induced akathisia treated with clozapine",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Akathisia is probably the most troublesome side effect of antipsychotic medications. The onset of akathisia may be acute, chronic, tardive, or delayed, or may occur when switching or stopping antipsychotics. While its mechanism is poorly understood, the current hypothesis is low dopaminergic tone, with studies showing interactions in mesolimbic, mesocortical, and spinal dopamine/norepinephrine pathways and the involvement of multiple other neurotransmitter systems.[1] Second-generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine have a very low propensity to cause akathisia but are not entirely free of such side effects.[2] A 32-year-old woman presented with an 11-year history suggestive of prominent delusion of infidelity, hallucinatory behavior, aggression toward her husband, forgetfulness, and poor personal hygiene. She was diagnosed with psychosis not otherwise specified with a differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, with no history of prior psychiatric treatment. The patient was started on increasing doses of Tab. Risperidone up to 6 mg/day. She developed extrapyramidal side effects, which were treated with Tab. Trihexyphenidyl up to 4 mg/day, which she was not able to tolerate due to its side effects of excessive dryness of mouth and constipation. Risperidone was cross-tapered with olanzapine, which was gradually increased to 10 mg/day. Although with 10 mg olanzapine, her symptoms improved, the patient reported subjective restlessness, with the patient complaining of the urge to move around. She was observed to be fidgety, tapping her feet, and difficulty sitting still. This warranted a diagnosis of olanzapine-induced akathisia. The patient was prescribed Tab. Propranolol 20 mg with only minimal improvement in symptoms of akathisia. Olanzapine was cross-tapered with increasing doses of clozapine with which akathisia completely resolved and psychotic symptoms also improved considerably. The patient on the last follow-up was in full remission on clozapine 200 mg/day. Drugs such as clozapine and quetiapine, which have a weak dopaminergic action and a more potent serotonergic effect, may rarely cause akathisia in the absence of another antipsychotic.[1] Treatment of akathisia must ideally start with prevention, psychosocial methods, and modifications in the treatment such as careful cross-tapering of potent with less potent antipsychotics with close monitoring of psychotic symptoms.[1] In our patient, the change in medication from Olanzapine to Clozapine showed significant improvement in her psychotic symptoms as well as ameliorated the akathisia. Other pharmacological interventions include beta-blockers such as propranolol, which was the first-line treatment for akathisia. Anticholinergics and benzodiazepines have some therapeutic value as well but their effects may not be sufficient to reduce akathisia. Newer treatments include Mianserine and Cyproheptadine, which have the potential to counteract psychotropic-induced D2 receptor blockade. Another new intervention is the use of low-dose Mirtazapine.[3] Akathisia may also develop due to drug-drug interactions between psychotropic medications and other drugs such as antimicrobials. Therefore, it is important to take a detailed medical history in order to identify and/or prevent side effects that may be caused by such drug interactions.[4] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "abstract": "Introduction. In recent years there has been a rising trend of anticholinergics use among high school students and it is especially common to mix alcohol with anticholinergics. The characteristic features of anticholinergic intoxication are the rapid onset of alterations in mood, cognition and perception in the presence of a clear sensorium and following the ingestion of the drug in a commonly distributable form. But if psychotic symptoms are present in the absence of retained reality testing a diagnosis of substance- induced psychotic disorder may be warranted. Therefore, in same cases clinical picture presents a differential diagnostic dilemma. Case Outline. The authors present the case report of twenty-one year old male with dependence of multiple drug use (according the criteria of ICD-X ) ,who was observed in the Detoxication Clinic. In early adolescence he used different psychoactive substances (opiate and nonopiate psychoactive substances). During the last two years he episodically consumed anticholinergics. Upon the mixed use of alcohol with anticholinergics he experienced auditory hallucinations, rapid and incoherent speech and paranoid ideation. He acted out his imperative hallucinations aggressively and violently. During hospital treatment he was treated with antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines and supportive and educational therapies. Conclusion. On this regiment psychotic symptoms resolved completely. Results of the complete psychiatricpsychological examination did not indicate psychotic disorder. .",

Dans la depression, l'impact fonctionnel est majeur et genere des difficultes quant aux capacites de travail. Le concept de remission fonctionnelle a pris de l'importance dans notre societe ces dernieres annees. L'aptitude a la reprise de travail en fait partie. De nombreux facteurs peuvent influencer la remission fonctionnelle d'un episode depressif majeur en remission clinique partielle comme les symptomes cliniques residuels de la depression (symptomatologie anxieuse, troubles du sommeil...), les comorbidites (psychiatriques / somatiques eventuelles), la prise d'un traitement antidepresseur, les evenements professionnels, les troubles cognitifs residuels de la depression (deficit des fonctions executives, deficits attentionnels, ralentissement psychomoteur). Ce travail a explore l'Influence de la Cognition Sociale et plus specifiquement de la Theorie de l'Esprit sur la remission fonctionnelle de la depression et l'aptitude professionnelle, au travers d'une etude comparative de 30 patients en remission partielle d'un episode depressif majeur, repartis en deux groupes en fonction de leur statut professionnel. Nous avons constate dans ce travail, un deficit en Theorie de l'Esprit plus marque (a l'aide de l'epreuve des Faux Pas et de la tâche d'interpretation des regards) chez les patients n'ayant pas d'activite professionnelle et nous pouvons envisager qu'un deficit en Theorie de l'Esprit pourrait etre un facteur de mauvaise remission fonctionnelle et par consequent avoir une influence deletere sur le retour a l'emploi.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness can arise from over-compensation of neural processes when they attempt to correct nervous system perturbation, regardless of the original cause. Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

On the one hand they may appear as a symptom of a disorder, which may also be a diagnostic criterion, as for example in affective disorders, on the other hand they may be independent disorders or last but not least sequelae of psychiatric disorders or their pharmacological therapy, as with antidepressants or neuroleptics, which may cause or deteriorate nocturnal movement disorders. They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor. This is why sleep disorders should be taken seriously and treated adequately.",

Instrumental reflexes of active and passive avoidance, negative learning, behavior with a change in the stereotype of learning are more greatly damaged.

In this contract, altitude hypoxic adaptation enhances information fixation and increases the degree and duration of retention of temporary relations. Nootropic agents with an antihypoxic action exert a marked effect on hypoxia-induced cognitive and memory disorders and the magnitude of this effect depends on the ration of proper nootropic to antihypoxic components in the spectrum of the drugs' pharmacological activity. The agents that combine a prevailing antiamnestic effect and a marked and moderate antihypoxic action (mexidole, nooglutil, pyracetam, beglymin, etc.) are most effective in eliminating different hypoxia-induced cognitive and memory disorders, nootropic drugs that have a pronounced antiamnestic activity (centrophenoxine, etc.) and no antihypoxic component also restore the main types of mnestic disorders after hypoxia, but to a lesser extent.",

For many AEDs, the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood. More than half of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieve sustained seizure freedom with their first or second drug trials. After a prolonged time of seizure freedom discontinuation of therapy may be considered; the risk of relapse after drug withdrawal can be estimated on the basis of a number of clinical factors.

In addition, eyelid swelling and conjunctival injection may be present1. Due to these additional symptoms and due to the occurrence of pain, orbital myositis usually can be easily differentiated from nerve lesions as causes of diplopia.

The drug is efficient in both focal and generalized forms of epilepsy. The following adverse effects of treatment may possibly develop: fatigability, thought disorder, headache and confused mental state. It should be borne in mind that the majority of adverse effects disappeared spontaneously in the course of treatment. Such adverse effects as reduction of body weight and nephrolithiasis generally occurred as long-term side effects of treatment.",

      "title": "Ketamine for Depression, 1: Clinical Summary of Issues Related to Efficacy, Adverse Effects, and Mechanism of Action",
      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

      "abstract": "Introducción y objetivos: Una de las causas más frecuentes de psicosis es el consumo de sustancias. El consumo de cocaína se asocia a la presentación, transitoria o persistente, de síntomas psicóticos por su potente acción como inhibidor de la recaptación de dopamina. Se presenta un caso clínico de una paciente con TLP y psicosis inducida por cocaína que se ensaya tratamiento con cariprazina. Los criterios diagnósticos para el trastorno psicótico inducido por sustancias según DSM-V son: delirios o alucinaciones, examen físico compatible y resultados analíticos en orina positivos a tóxicos, con síntomas durante o inmediatamente después de la intoxicación o abstinencia de la sustancia psicoactiva. La cariprazina difiere de otros antipsicóticos por su actividad agonista parcial y su mayor afinidad por los receptores D3. Este perfil exclusivo parece tener consecuencias beneficiosas sobre los síntomas negativos, la disforia y el deterioro cognitivo. Estudios realizados apuntan a que la cariprazina reduciría el efecto gratificante de la cocaína sobre el sistema de recompensa y reduciría la necesidad de su consumo. Material y métodos: Descripción de un caso clínico y revisión de la literatura. Resultados y conclusiones: Se presenta el caso clínico de una mujer con antecedente de trastorno límite de la personalidad y trastorno por uso de sustancias (cannabis y cocaína) que consulta por síntomas psicóticos en contexto de consumo de cocaína. Se realiza tratamiento ambulatorio inicialmente con olanzapina y diazepam, siendo su evolución parcialmente favorable, presentando hiperfagia y aumento de peso, por lo que se cambia a cariprazina, mejorando la hiperorexia, el craving a cocaína y manteniéndose abstinente y en remisión de la clínica psicótica. Cariprazina se presenta como una opción para el tratamiento de la psicosis aguda por cocaína y mantenimiento de la abstinencia.",

      "title": "Drug-induced seizures: prevalence, risk factors, treatment and prevention",
      "abstract": "There is a growing interest to the problem of drug-induced epileptic seizures (ES) due to their relatively high prevalence, poor prognosis, a large number of different drugs associated with the development of drug-induced ES, and low awareness among general practitioners. Drug-induced ES are most often associated with the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptic drugs (overdose or as a result of discontinuation), antibiotics, immunosuppressants and immunomodulators, antitumor agents, analgesics, central nervous system stimulators, anesthetics etc. The prevalence of drug-induced ES varies with different drugs. It is estimated that about 6.1% of the first occurring ES are drug-induced. Risk factors for drug-induced ES include a history of epilepsy or ES, cancer, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, several concomitant neurological diseases, mental disorders, childhood, old and very old age, fever, impaired liver metabolism in patients with liver diseases, impaired drug excretion in patients with kidney diseases, polypharmacy, pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs themselves, allowing them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in the central nervous system (lipophilicity, transport and communication with blood plasma proteins), drug concentration in blood serum, method and frequency of drug administration, single and daily doses of drugs. No clinical guidelines for the management of patients with drug-induced ES are available. It is recommended to identify patients at risk: elderly patients, patients with impaired liver and kidney function and patients receiving drugs that can cause ES and/or lower the seizure threshold. Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment in drug-induced status epilepticus, barbiturates and propofol are the second-line treatment. The general principles for the prevention of drug-induced ES include careful selection of the optimal dose of drugs that can cause ES, especially in patients with impaired liver and/or kidney function, monitoring of several parameters in blood serum (for example, liver enzymes, electrolytes, glucose etc.), monitoring of the blood plasma concentration of certain drugs, avoiding the simultaneous administration of several drugs that stimulate the central nervous system, and a rapid discontinuation of such drugs.В последние годы возрос интерес к проблеме лекарственно-индуцированных эпилептических приступов (ЭП) в связи с их достаточно высокой распространенностью, неблагоприятным прогнозом, большим количеством различных лекарственных средств (ЛС), прием которых ассоциирован с развитием лекарственно-индуцированных ЭП, и низкой осведомленностью практикующих врачей об этом вопросе. Лекарственно-индуцированные ЭП наиболее часто ассоциированы с приемом антидепрессантов, антипсихотических ЛС, противоэпилептических препаратов (передозировка или как результат прекращения их приема), антибиотиков, иммуносупрессоров (иммунодепрессантов) и иммуномодуляторов, противоопухолевых ЛС, анальгетиков, анестетиков, ЛС, стимулирующих центральную нервную систему (ЦНС), и др. Распространенность лекарственно-индуцированных ЭП варьирует при использовании разных ЛС. Считается, что около 6,1% впервые возникших ЭП являются лекарственно-индуцированными. К факторам риска развития лекарственно-индуцированных ЭП относят наличие эпилепсии или ЭП в анамнезе, онкологические заболевания, нарушение функции гематоэнцефалического барьера, наличие ряда сопутствующих неврологических заболеваний, психические расстройства, детский возраст, пожилой и старческий возраст, лихорадку, нарушение метаболизма ЛС в печени у пациентов с заболеваниями печени, нарушенное выведение ЛС у пациентов с болезнями почек, полипрагмазию, фармакокинетические свойства самих препаратов, позволяющие проникать через гематоэнцефалический барьер в ЦНС (липофильность, транспорт и связь с белками плазмы крови), концентрация ЛС в сыворотке крови, способ и кратность введения препаратов, разовые и суточные дозы ЛС. Единых клинических рекомендаций по ведению пациентов с лекарственно-индуцированными ЭП не существует. Рекомендуется четко идентифицировать пациентов, входящих в группу риска развития лекарственно-индуцированных ЭП, т.е. пожилых пациентов, пациентов с нарушением функции печени и почек и больных, получающих ЛС, которые способны вызвать ЭП и/или снизить порог судорожной готовности. Препаратами для стартовой терапии при лекарственно-индуцированном эпилептическом статусе являются бензодиазепины, препаратами второй линии - барбитураты и пропофол. К общим принципам профилактики лекарственно-индуцированных ЭП относят тщательный подбор оптимальной дозы ЛС, способного вызвать ЭП, особенно у пациентов с нарушением функции печени и/или почек; мониторинг уровня некоторых показателей в сыворотке крови (например, печеночные ферменты, электролиты, глюкоза и т.д.), мониторинг концентрации некоторых ЛС в плазме крови, избегание одновременного назначения нескольких ЛС, стимулирующих ЦНС, и резкого прекращения приема подобных ЛС.",

Most clinically important antiseizure medication (ASM) interactions with other drugs result from induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing hepatic enzymes or significant protein binding properties. Other mechanisms, such as pharmacodynamic interactions between drugs, also may plat a role. Because many ASMs are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of hepatic enzymes and do exhibit significant protein binding, drug interactions are common in patients with epilepsy. Patients who have renal or hepatic disorders are especially vulnerable to drug interactions.",

In adults it is often missed due to non-specific symptoms of growth hormone deficiency and hypogonadism or mild deficiencies of other pituitary hormones. In some it may present with acute onset of symptoms suggestive of acute adrenal (corticotropin) insufficiency or symptoms due to mass lesion in/or around pituitary. High index of suspicion is required to seek hypopituitarism in patients with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue and malaise. Treatment of isolated hormone deficiency, partial or panhypopituitarism, has gratifying results although they require lifelong treatment and follow-up.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "We read with interest the article by Yun et al (1) describing 9 new patients with topiramate-induced palinopsia. Palinopsia, consisting of the persistence of visual images after the removal of the initial stimulus, may be observed in different medical conditions, especially migraine (2), but may also be provoked by different medications. Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug useful for migraine prophylaxis and for the treatment of both partial and generalized seizures (3). Topiramate has been rarely associated with adverse ocular events, in particular ciliochoroidal effusion syndrome, but patients with transitory visual disturbances induced by topiramate are being increasingly recognized (1). We evaluated 2 patients with other types of visual disturbances that were severe but transitory and fully reversible and appear related to beginning topiramate or dosage increase of the medication. Patient 1: A 19-year-old woman had a 1-year history of migraine with aura. Her headaches usually were preceded by visual symptoms (teichopsia or visual distortion) lasting for about 20–30 minutes and occurred monthly. Topiramate was started at a daily dose of 25 mg. Within 5 days, she complained as if looking “through a veil.” This visual disturbance was continuous, and she was not taking any other medications. A complete ophthalmologic examination was unremarkable. Physical examination, numerous blood tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalography were normal. Topiramate was discontinued, and within 2 days, her visual symptoms completely disappeared. She was prescribed amitriptyline for migraine prophylaxis. There was no recurrence of her visual symptoms in 6 years of follow-up. Patient 2: A 21-year-old man had a 6-year history of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Initially, he was treated with levetiracetam 3 g/d, with reduction of seizure frequency. At age 20 years, topiramate 100 mg/d was added, and he remained seizure-free for 5 months. He then experienced 2 generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and his topiramate was gradually increased by 50 mg/wk up to 200 mg/d. Two days after reaching the maximal dosage, the patient complained of severe blurred vision (“I see all black”) that lasted for approximately 30 minutes. He had no similar symptoms in the past and was taking no other medications. Neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations were normal. Topiramate was gradually reduced to 50 mg/d and valproate was given at 1,000 mg/d. In the ensuing 9 years, he has not experienced seizures or visual disturbances. Our 2 patients had reversible visual disturbances associated with use of topiramate. In our first patient, visual complaints began after institution of topiramate, whereas in the second patient, visual symptoms were associated with an increase in the dose of medication. Either discontinuing the medication (patient 1) or lowering the dose (patient 2) led to cessation of the visual disturbances. The symptoms experienced by our patients expand the spectrum of visual complaints experienced by patients taking topiramate.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM5) provides diagnoses for these opioid-induced conditions. Substance-induced disorders, particularly for depression and anxiety, include intoxication and withdrawal, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Importantly, DSM-5 criteria indicate that diagnoses for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder cannot be made if there is a substance, such as opioid medications, responsible for the condition. Often the way to distinguish between a substanceinduced disorder and an independent major depressive or anxiety disorder is to discontinue the opioid medications. Given that opioids are not efficacious for long-term prescribing, discontinuation of the medication is the treatment of choice.",

The definition of coma in terms of cerebral functioning refers to a state of acute brain failure not strictly related to any particular cerebral substratum or specific anatomical level of lesion. Coma normally occurs when broad areas in the upper and lower brain stems, or cerebral hemispheres, or simultaneously in the cerebral hemispheres and brain stem are damaged.

Pharmacokinetic variables—absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination—are all altered to a greater or lesser extent. As a general rule, the elderly are more sensitive to psychotropic drug actions than younger patients. This is particularly so in the over 80s. The elderly tend to suffer from physical conditions which may cause insomnia and anxiety, and medication for those physical complaints may interact with psychotropic medication. In the treatment of insomnia, short- or intermediate acting benzodiazepines are preferable to long-acting compounds which tend to accumulate and produce confusional states and ataxia. Similarly, the benefit/risk ratio for anxiolytics is least in the elderly. Compounds of intermediate half-life and no active metabolites, such as oxazepam, are preferable. Anxiety syndromes occurring in other contexts, e.g. dementia may be better treated with low doses of antipsychotic drugs.",

      "title": "Modern Treatment of Status Epilepticus in Adults",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a serious epileptic condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It can be divided into four stages: developing (seizures leading up to status epilepticus), established (>5 minutes convulsive status epilepticus, nonconvulsive/focal status epilepticus >10 min), refractory (failure of two adequately dosed antiseizure medications in different drug classes), and super-refractory (persisting despite >24 hours of anesthesia). All seizure types can develop to status epilepticus. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus has the largest potential for brain damage. The drug treatment algorithms for status epilepticus generally go through three stages, starting with benzodiazepines: lorazepam, midazolam, or diazepam as first line drugs, moving to levetiracetam, valproate or fos-phenytoin as second-line drugs, ending, if necessary, with anesthetics like propofol or midazolam. Lacosamide, topiramate, phenobarbital, brivaracetam, and perampanel are potential alternatives, and pentobarbital is commonly used when long-term anesthesia is needed. Super refractory status epilepticus is the form that usually causes the most concern. Treatment guidelines for newer treatment alternatives are often based only on case reports and small patient series. Such alternatives include ketamine, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, inhalation anesthetics and hypothermia, and several surgical neurostimulation procedures. This chapter provides an overview of current treatment alternatives, with particular focus on refractory status epilepticus and super-refractory status epilepticus.",

Symptoms are grouped in three main categories: re-experiencing the event, accompanied by anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks; persistent avoidance of any reminders of the event, feeling detached or estranged from others; persistent anxiety and/or physical reactivity. As treatment, besides various psychotherapy techniques, various classes of psychotropic drugs are used, such as morphine, antipsychotics, usual or atypical antidepressants, anticonvulsants, to reduce anxiety, avoidance, nightmares and hyperexcitability.",

      "abstract": "Opioid analgesics are useful agents for treating pain of various etiologies; however, adverse effects are potential limitations to their use. Strategies to minimize adverse effects of opioids include dose reduction, symptomatic management, opioid rotation, and changing the route of administration. Nausea occurs in approximately 25 percent of patients; prophylactic measures may not be required. Patients who do develop nausea will require antiemetic treatment with an antipsychotic, prokinetic agent, or serotonin antagonist. Understanding the mechanism for opioid-induced nausea will aid in the selection of appropriate agents. Constipation is considered an expected side effect with chronic opioid use. Physicians should minimize the development of constipation using prophylactic measures. Monotherapy with stool softeners often is not effective; a stool softener combined with a stimulant laxative is preferred. Sedation and cognitive changes occur with initiation of therapy or dose escalation. Underlying disease states or other centrally acting medications often will compound the opioid's adverse effects. Minimizing unnecessary medications and judicious use of stimulants and antipsychotics are used to manage the central nervous system side effects. Pruritus may develop, but it is generally not considered an allergic reaction. Antihistamines are the preferred management option should pharmacotherapy treatment be required.",

After inducing an initial amelioration, the patient had a re-exacerbation of auditory hallucinations and a clinical and psychosocial worsening, which subsided after olanzapine discontinuation. Olanzapine may induce a worsening of hallucinations in a psychotic disorder with substantial affective component and therefore its use should be carefully evaluated in such cases.",

El estudio incluyo historia clinica completa, examenes de laboratorio, interrogatorio sobre habitos y niveles de consumo, y consecuencias sociales del consumo de alcohol. Ademas, se diseno un cuestionario para la identificacion temprana de los bebedores que abusan del alcohol en forma excesiva. Se encontro que el consumo excesivo de alcohol esta asociado con numerosos signos y sintomas relacionados con el aparato cardiovascular, el digestivo y el sistema nervioso central, incluyendo la esfera mental. Asimismo, que estas manifestaciones producen, con cierta frecuencia, confusion en el medico y son atribuidas a otros procesos patologicos. La aplicacion del cuestionario, denominado AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), permitio establecer ciertos indicadores clinicos de las fases tempranas de consumo peligroso de alcohol; de ellos destacan: insomnio y/o ansiedad, temblor distal de miembros superiores, trastornos digestivos vagos, accidentes frecuentes, impuntualidad en el trabajo y/o ausentismo laboral, tension nerviosa sin causa aparente, elevacion de la gamaglutamil-transferasa, aumento del volumen globular medio, macrocitosis sin anemia y aumento de lipoproteinas de alta densidad. El analisis de estos resultados demostro que el AUDIT es un instrumento de tamizaje altamente sensible (80%) y especifico (89%), con un valor promedio predictivo positivo de 60% y un valor promedio predictivo negativo de 95%. La aplicacion sistematica del AUDIT, particularmente en el primer nivel de atencion medica, podria ser de gran beneficio para los pacientes y para la comunidad.",

      "title": "ECT: An Effective Treatment in the Screaming Demented Patient",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—As a tertiary inpatient geriatric psychiatry program, we are often exposed to a common treatment dilemma, the screaming demented patient. Very little has been published in this area. The studies reporting on agitation are mostly medical descriptions and pharmacologic trials, with verbal agitation being included under the broader symptom cluster of physical or behavioral agitation.1,2 Agitation is usually poorly defined, and in no studies was verbal agitation considered as a separate variable. As a whole, the medication trials achieved only limited degrees of success. Experience dictates that these successes are often more than offset by medication side-effects and drug toxicity, thus further complicating the patient's presentation and course.3 Partly owing to this lack of effective treatment, Fogel4 suggested the need for further investigation of ECT in the screaming demented patient. Verbal agitation (needless, unstimulated screaming, yelling, moaning) occurs in many psychiatric conditions common to the elderly—delirium, dementia and depression. It is unclear whether this is the result of a common final neurochemical pathway or of differing etiologies in the different conditions.5 We wish to report on a small series of three elderly, verbally agitated patients who showed a dramatic improvement in this symptom with bilateral ECT. In none of these patients was ECT the initial treatment modality employed; neuroleptics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines were tried unsuccsssfully first. One patient clearly met the criteria for major depression and had a past history of ECT-responsive mood disorder. In the other two patients, there was no clear history of major depression either past or current; both had a substantial degree of cognitive impairment. All three patients, exhibited rapid resolution of their screaming behaviour early in their course of ECT. These pilot results suggest some interesting directions. Assuming response to ECT, this might support the hypothesis that screaming in dementia may be a presentation of depression where the other symptoms may be difficult to elicit. On the other hand, the response may suggest a specific response to electrotherapy. Irrespective of the mechanism, ECT appears to provide the possibility of effective therapy in the demented patient who screams and could provide an alternative to the more traditional approach of endless trials of progressively more toxic psychotropic drugs, singly and in combination, with poor outcome and potentially devastating toxicity.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

It can present in different clinical forms, including hyperactive and hypoactive delirium. Hyperactive delirium is characterized by increased psychomotor activity, agitation, and disruptive behavior, while hypoactive delirium is characterized by reduced psychomotor activity, somnolence, and decreased responsiveness. The diagnosis of hyperactive and hypoactive delirium involves a comprehensive evaluation of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to identify underlying causes and exclude other conditions. Prompt recognition and accurate diagnosis are crucial for appropriate management and treatment. The management of hyperactive and hypoactive delirium aims at addressing the underlying etiology, ensuring patient safety, and alleviating distressing symptoms. Treatment strategies include the optimization of medical conditions, discontinuation or adjustment of offending medications, and supportive care. Pharmacological interventions, such as the use of sedative medications for hyperactive delirium or stimulant agents for hypoactive delirium, may be considered when necessary. Multidisciplinary collaboration involving healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, and therapists, is essential for the comprehensive care of patients with hyperactive and hypoactive delirium. In conclusion, hyperactive and hypoactive delirium are distinct clinical manifestations of an acute confusional state. Their identification, diagnosis, and management require a multidimensional approach to address the underlying causes and alleviate symptoms. Early recognition and appropriate interventions are crucial for improving patient outcomes and enhancing their overall well-being.",

      "title": "Effects of behavioural traits and the endogenous opioid system in neuropathic pain manifestations",
      "abstract": "Introduccion El dolor neuropatico es definido como el dolor que es iniciado o causado por una lesion o disfuncion primaria en el sistema nervioso (Merskey and Bogduk, 1994). El dolor cronico es un trastorno complejo que incluye manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas que muestran una alta variabilidad interindividual dependiente de multiples factores, incluyendo los rasgos de personalidad de los pacientes (Asghari and Nicholas, 2006; La Porta et al., 2016). Dentro de las manifestaciones nociceptivas, el dolor neuropatico, se desarrollan signos sensoriales anormales como dolor espontaneo, alodinia e hiperalgesia (Bridges et al., 2001). El dolor neuropatico esta frecuentemente asociado con desordenes afectivos como ansiedad y depresion. Tambien se ha establecido una relacion entre el dolor y deficits cognitivos como el problemas de memoria y aprendizaje (Kodama et al., 2011; Low et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2011). El sistema opioide endogeno esta altamente relacionado con la modulacion de las funciones fisiologicas que son afectadas por el dolor neuropatico, ademas de su mas conocida funcion que es la induccion de analgesia endogena (Le Merrer et al., 2009).\nObjetivos Los objetivos de este trabajo fueron: validar en ratones, diferentes paradigmas conductuales para medir las manifestaciones emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico inducido por la ligadura parcial del nervio ciatico; evaluar la influencia de rasgos conductuales especificos sobre las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico y explorar la influencia de las preproencefalinas en las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico.\nMetodos y Resultados Primero, modelos clasicos de comportamiento fueron validados para evaluar las manifestaciones emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico. Despues, evaluamos la influencia de los rasgos especificos de comportamiento, asi como el papel de la preproencefalinas (Penk) en las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico inducido por ligadura parcial del nervio ciatico en ratones. Se observo que era posible detectar las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico dependientes del tiempo a traves de paradigmas clasicos utilizados para evaluar comportamientos como la ansiedad, la depresion y la funcion cognitiva. Se identificaron los genes Pdyn y Gadd45 en amigdala como biomarcadores de la influencia de los rasgos de ansiedad y depresion en las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico. La delecion de Penk produjo un efecto techo en el desarrollo de ansiedad y deficits cognitivos producidos por el dolor neuropatico. Este efecto techo se relaciono con el mantenimiento de la expresion de Pdyn, KOR, Npas4 y Nr3c1 en la amigdala y con la disminucion en la expresion de Nr3c1 en el hipocampo, respectivamente. \nConclusiones En la presente tesis, a traves de paradigmas clasicos de comportamiento, se detecto la influencia de rasgos especificos de comportamiento y el papel de las preproencefalinas en las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas asociadas a dolor neuropatico. Estas manifestaciones fueron sensibles principalmente a la ansiedad y depresion. Finalmente, se identifico la preproencefalina como un componente esencial para el desarrollo de los cambios fisiologicos y comportamentales inducidos por el dolor neuropatico. \nReferencias Asghari, A., Nicholas, M.K.

      "title": "Some aspects of tobacco smoking in the context of alcohol drinking, hangover and mental health problems",
      "abstract": "The public health relevance of hangover is in its potential effects on occupational safety and performance. Apart from pharmacological effects of ethanol and congeners, psychosocial factors also contribute to morning-after feelings, particularly the emotions of shame and guilt. Tobacco smoking increases the hangover's incidence and severity, explained by pharmacological effects of nicotine and other smoke constituents. During a drinking binge, many people would smoke more than usual; some intermittent smokers or those who gave up would restart. The hangover \"curing\" with beer or vodka the next morning (hair of the dog) may contribute to negative affectivity in the long run, as it implies a cycle of alcohol consumption and shame. Some individuals experience a temporary symptomatic relief after a hair of the dog drink. According to our observations, if the \"curing\" is accompanied by smoking, the elevated mood in some people would more easily shift to dysphoria, irritation or depression. Psychological mechanisms thereof are discussed here. Besides, the problem of smoking in psychiatric hospitals is briefly discussed. In conclusion, smoking can exacerbate hangover symptoms through both toxicological and psychosocial mechanisms. The problem of smoking in the settings of alcoholism and mental health problems should be further investigated.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Scopolamine is the most effective single drug for the prophylaxis and treatment of motion sickness. However, oral or injected scopolamine displays a comparatively short duration of action (5-6 hours), and leads to deleterious side effects on autonomic and central nervous system cholinergic functions. The transdermal scopolamine system was designed to reduce these problems, but while it does deliver scopolamine over a prolonged time period (72 h), deleterious side effects are also produced. Transdermal scopolamine provides significant motion sickness protection, similar in extent to that provided by oral scopolamine or dimenhydrinate. Its autonomic nervous system effects comprise reduced salivation, bradycardia, and blurred vision due to reduced visual accommodation. The visual problems increase following repeated patch applications, with hypermetropic (\"long sighted\") individuals particularly at risk. Central nervous system effects comprise reduced memory for new information, impaired attention, and lowered feelings of alertness. Variation in response to transdermal scopolamine has also been reported, both between individuals, and between different patch applications on the same individual.",

Cocaine-induced excited delirium refers to fatal cocaine intoxication with the following symptoms occurring sequentially: hyperthermia, delirium with agitation, respiratory arrest, and death. We present a case of cocaine-induced excited delirium in a cocaine \"body packer\" or a \"mule\", specifically an individual who attempts to smuggle cocaine within the body. Investigators at the scene initially suspected homicide due to the victim's sharp and blunt force injuries. Three rubber packets containing cocaine were removed from the victim's rectum. Blood toxicological analysis revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.016 g/100 and cocaine >1 mg/L. The forensic pathologist should consider cocaine-induced excited delirium when an individual exhibits aggressive behavior, unexpected strength, and resistance to pain who dies suddenly. Further analysis should be performed during the scene investigation and autopsy for evidence of body packing.",

Inadequate sleep, either in duration or quality, and altered sleep-wake cycles are common reports in palliative care. The causes for insomnia in palliative care may be related to psychological factors (anxiety or depression), pain, treatment-related toxicity, or other comorbid medical conditions. Untreated insomnia can lead to daytime sleepiness, irritability, depressive or anxious mood, and accidents. Assessment, prevention, and management are addressed. The chapter includes discussion regarding sleep hygiene, the role of exercise, and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Education of patients and their family members is imperative to address this syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Falls are a major health problem among the elderly and an estimated 6% of falls by elderly result in fractures. Early identification of fall risk is likely to result in earlier implementation of intervention and to minimise development of secondary problems such as reduced confidence and activity levels. A comprehensive falls risk factor assessment should be performed for older people who present for medical attention after a fall, those who had more than one fall in the preceding year or those who have abnormalities of gait or balance. Falls are as a result of extrinsic risk factors, intrinsic risk factor or a combination of both. Syncope is defined as a transient, self limited loss of consciousness usually leading to a fall. Syncope and falls are often considered two separate entities with different aetiologies. Disorders affecting balance in the elderly are cerebral, cerebellar, spinal cord disorders; dementia; arrhythmias; postural hypotension; cerebrovascular disease; musculoskeletal/orthopaedic disorders; intervertebral disc disorders; psychological factors; visual impairment. Effective interventions include: (1) Health promotion and falls prevention. (2) Single interventions. (3) Medication review. (4) Exercise. (5) Home modifications. (6) To improve safety in the home. (7) To improve safety outside the home. Effective preventive strategies require better understanding of the causes of and risk factors for falling among elderly.",

      "title": "Emergence Delir - Prophylaxe und Therapie",
      "abstract": "Das Emergence Delirium (ED) ist ein in der Kinderanästhesie bekanntes Phänomen. Problematisch sind trotz fehlender vitaler Gefährdung und i. d. R. kompletter Remission v. a. die Eigen- und Fremdgefährdung sowie die negative Außenwirkung auf Eltern und Beteiligte. Die Symptome des ED bestehen aus Agitation und Delir. Da v. a. bei Kleinkindern viele Gründe für auffälliges Verhalten nach Operationen in Frage kommen (Hunger, Durst, Schmerzen, Übelkeit, Trennung von den Eltern) ist die Diagnosestellung häufig nicht einfach. Die Verwendung entsprechend validierter Scores wie der PAED-Scale, ist dabei hilfreich. Die genaue Genese des ED ist bisher unklar. Neuere Untersuchungen deuten auf eine unterschiedliche Clearance der (volatilen) Anästhetika in verschiedenen Bereichen des Gehirns (Gehör vor Kognition) oder den unterschiedlichen Einfluss der Anästhetika auf verschiedene neuronale Netzwerke. Im Rahmen einer Metaanalyse wurde der präventive Effekt vieler gängiger Substanzen untersucht. Grundsätzlich reduzieren alle Substanzen die Inzidenz des ED, die auch postoperativ noch eine sedierende und analgetische Wirkung haben. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass der Aufwachphase die gleiche Aufmerksamkeit wie der Einleitung zukommen sollte und beides schonend und kindgerecht in ruhiger Atmosphäre zu erfolgen hat. Liegen Risikofaktoren vor, ist eine TIVA zu bevorzugen. Zusätzlich kann ein Alpha-2-Agonist verwendet werden. Zur Differenzierung zwischen postoperativen Schmerzen und Delir können altersgerechte, standardisierte Scores für ED und Schmerzen hilfreich sein. Bei milderer Ausprägung kann ein beobachtendes Zuwarten gerechtfertigt sein. Sollte Eigen- oder Fremdgefährdung bestehen, eignen sich kurzwirksame Substanzen, um die Akutsituation zu durchbrechen. Dabei hat sich v. a. Propofol bewährt. Verängstigte Eltern müssen beruhigt und entsprechend aufgeklärt werden. Midazolam hat weder einen präventiven Effekt, noch eignet es sich als Akutmedikament und sollte daher zurückhaltend eingesetzt werden (auch im Rahmen der Prämedikation). Eine effektive Anxiolyse sollte nach Möglichkeit bereits im Vorfeld durch Schulung von Patient und Eltern beginnen, welche die Ablenkung des Kindes und Einbeziehung der Eltern zum Ziel hat. Auch aus diesem Grund ist die Anwesenheit der Eltern bei Einleitung und im Aufwachraum begrüßenswert.",

In some cases, as in depression, the improvement in memory as the emotional disorder resolves may be offset directly by the antimemory effects caused by continued use of the drug. Because of the effects emotional illness has on cognitive function, normal volunteers are often used in clinical research investigating the effects of psychotropic drugs on memory. This means that drugs are tested in a single dose, or at most a few doses, rather than being administered for months or years as in the clinical situation. Drug testing in normal volunteers, therefore, may not detect longterm psychotropic drug effects on memory. Although the research data are",

However, in adolescence, psychotic symptoms are more likely to occur in a range of emotional and other disorders, in addition to major psychotic disorders. Paranoid experiences occur along a continuum in the adolescent and can be transient, and many respond to psychological approaches. By contrast, schizophrenia, a serious psychiatric disorder, that involves multi-system disturbances of perception, thinking, volition and cognition, is extremely rare before the age of ten. However, the incidence rises steadily through adolescence to reach a peak in early adult life to become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Childhood and adolescent-onset schizophrenia share many characteristics with the later onset forms, but are more severe with early neurodevelopment abnormalities and a poorer response to treatment.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Syncope in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Syncope is defined as a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness associated with loss of postural tone and should be differentiated from other states of altered consciousness such as cardiac arrest, coma, narcolepsy, seizures, dizziness, and vertigo. Although multiple studies have focused on the diagnostic workup and on the prognosis of patients with syncope,1-5 data on the evaluation and outcome of elderly patients are only recently being reported.6, 7 Establishing a cause of syncope is frequently difficult. There are at least three possible reasons for the inability to define a cause of syncope. One, abnormalities causing syncope are frequently episodic or isolated events and may not be found at initial evaluation. Two, the diagnostic criteria for causes of syncope may be too stringent, leading to underdiagnosis. Three, many patients evaluated after the syncopal event may not recall the details surrounding their episode. If witnesses are not present, valuable observations are lost and the cause of syncope may not be apparent. Additionally, the evaluation of syncope in the elderly is especially more difficult because the elderly often have multiple coexisting diseases, maybe taking multiple medications, and have age-related physiologic changes that can predispose to syncope. Elderly noninstitutionalized patients have on the average 3.5 chronic diseases8 including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disorders, all of which can predispose to syncope. Older patients are reported to take three times as many drugs as the general population,9 and many of these medications may make persons susceptible to syncope. Additionally, age-related physiologic changes may alter the normal homeostatic mechanisms maintaining blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. Baroreceptor sensitivity decreases with age and the heart rate increase in response to upright posture, exercise, cough, and hypoxia may be blunted.10, 11 Furthermore, aging results in a diminished ability of the kidneys to conserve sodium when intake is restricted and plasma renin and aldosterone responses may be diminished in the elderly, leading to difficulties in maintaining extracellular fluid balance.12 As previously emphasized,13 multiple pathologic processes together may result in syncope in the elderly and occasionally it may be difficult to specifically assign a single entity as its cause. We have recently analyzed the data from our prospective syncope study in order to compare the diagnosis and prognosis of 210 elderly patients (mean age, 71 years; range, 60 to 90 years) to 190 younger patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 14 to 59 years).6 Patients in this study were accrued from the inpatient and outpatient services of the Presbyterian-University Hospital, Pittsburgh, from April 1981 through September 1983 and all underwent a standardized diagnostic evaluation.2, 6 In our elderly patients, as noted in Table 1, initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (EKG) were useful in assigning a diagnosis in the majority of the patients in whom a cause could be found. Furthermore, in the elderly, diagnosis assigned by electroencephalogram, carotid massage, cardiac catheterization, cerebral angiogram, and stress test were suggested by findings on the initial history and physical examination. These results in the elderly are similar to previous studies which have shown that a careful initial history and physical examination is the most important step in the evaluation of patients with syncope.1-3 Previous studies, however, have also shown that in a substantial number of patients a cause of syncope cannot be established after the initial history, physical examination, and EKG. Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring has assumed a central role in the evaluation of this group of patients. Although in our study6 arrhythmias were more frequently diagnosed, and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring more often led to a diagnosis in the elderly, there are many issues regarding the use of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring that are not resolved. First, there is poor correlation between symptoms found during monitoring and concurrent electrocardiographic findings.14-16 Symptoms of dizziness or syncope during monitoring occur in 29 to 42% of patients.14-16 We have reported that a rhythm disturbance could not be identified during 75% of symptomatic periods.15 Arrhythmias may be excluded as a cause if the patient has syncope during monitoring, but no concurrent rhythm disturbance. However, most patients do not have syncope during monitoring. Therefore, presumptions regarding the cause of syncope based on asymptomatic findings are frequently necessary because of the prognostic importance and sporadic nature of the arrhythmias. However, high prevalenece of cardiac arrhythmias has been reported in asymptomatic elderly patients. Therefore, in elderly patients with syncope, it has been difficult to be certain which arrhythmias should be considered significant indicators for a potential cause of loss of consciousness. Validation of the criteria used by different investigators will be needed with long-term follow-up using recurrence of symptoms and mortality as endpoints. Second, the optimal duration of electrocardiographic monitoring has not been determined. One study suggested that patients should be continuously monitored until the symptoms recur.17 This approach is impractical and not cost-effective. We are currently evaluating the optimal duration of monitoring in patients with syncope. Third, the yield of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring is variable, showing transient arrhythmias as a potential cause of syncope in 10 to 64% of patients.18-23 Clinical predictors are needed to help identify patients more likely to have diagnostic findings. Because of the limitations of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, electrophysiologic studies have been advocated for use in the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope.24 These studies, however, consist of invasive and expensive diagnostic tests which are useful in the evaluation of very selected subgroups of patients with syncope, such as patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause “who have underlying organic heart disease. These tests may not be practical in many elderly patients who are frail, have multiple chronic medical illnesses, and who may not be able to undergo invasive diagnostic testing. A large number of abnormalities are reported on electrophysiologic studies but the diagnostic importance of many of these in terms of a cause of syncope is not well established. Although sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia, markedly prolonged H-V interval (greater than 80 m), and markedly prolonged sinus node recovery time are important findings in patients with unexplained syncope, the clinical significance of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, mildly prolonged H-V interval or sinus node recovery time, and induction of supraventricular tachycardia is not clear. Morbidity and mortality from syncope in the elderly may be different than the young. Injury after a fall in the elderly may have important ramifications in terms of the medical and psychological well-being of the elderly. Although there are no prior studies regarding injury due to syncope, studies on falls in the elderly reveal a higher incidence of bone fractures with advancing age.25 Approximately one-third of our patients had an injury due to a fall, but falls resulted in major trauma more frequently in the elderly. Bone fractures may be more likely to occur in the elderly because of their higher prevalence of osteoporosis. In addition, if premonitory symptoms are present, younger patients may be able to react more quickly and assume a supine or sitting position to avoid a severe injury. The mortality in our study was higher in the elderly as a reflection of deaths due to many underlying illnesses such as malignancies and pneumonia.6 In addition, more deaths in the elderly resulted from cardiovascular diseases such as chronic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease. Elderly patients in our study also had a higher incidence of sudden death. A multivariate analysis of our data6 revealed that patients with a cardiovascular cause of syncope are at exceedingly high risk of mortality and sudden death regardless of age. In patients with a noncardiovascular cause of syncope or syncope of unknown origin, older age, a history of congestive heart failure, and male sex were important risk factors for mortality and sudden death. Recent studies on syncope in conjunction with our study in the elderly6 provide a framework for the evaluation of elderly patients with syncope. These studies show that a careful history and physical examination will help establish many of the causes of syncope and may suggest many of the cardiac or non-cardiac causes that require further testing for definitive diagnosis. An EKG and electrocradiographic monitoring should be done in patients in whom a cause is not found on initial history and physical examination. In selected patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause who have organic heart disease, electrophysiologic studies may provide evidence for possible cause of syncope, but further studies are needed to define the risk and benefit of this test in elderly patients. Other diagnostic tests should be used selectively. Our studies have shown that nongoal-directed use of head computed tomography scan, electroencephalogram, and glucose tolerance test establish few if any causes of syncope.1, 2, 6 Elderly patients have higher morbidity and mortality than the young. A systematic and meticulous evaluation for cause of syncope in the elderly is needed in the hope of decreasing recurrences, morbidity, and the incidence of sudden death.",

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

      "title": "[The risk of epileptic seizures during antibiotic therapy].",
      "abstract": "Numerous antibiotics may trigger epileptic seizures or status epilepticus by decreasing inhibitory transmission in the brain, thus lowering the seizure threshold. The most potent seizurogenic effect is exerted by penicillins, cephalosporins, fluorochinolons and carbapenems. Predisposing factors that facilitate development of epileptic seizures in the course of antibiotic therapy comprise all conditions accompanied by damage to the blood-brain barrier (including cerebral trauma and encephalitis), a high dose of an antibiotic or lack of adequate dose adjustment in patients with renal failure. A particularly dangerous and difficult to diagnose complication is nonconvulsive status epilepticus in patients treated with cephalosporins. For this reason, in case the patient presents with alterations of consciousness in the course of cephalosporin therapy, an EEG test should be performed. Some antibiotics, such as carbapenems, macrolides and antitubercular medications enter into pharmacokinetic interactions with antiepileptic agents, causing a decrease or increase in the plasma concentration of the latter and in consequence lead to possible epileptic seizures or drug-associated neurotoxicity. In patients with risk of epileptic seizures or with diagnosed epilepsy, one should select an antibiotic with a low proconvulsive potential and administer it in an adequately adjusted dose, especially in individuals with renal failure. Employing antibiotics interacting with antiepileptic medications with which the patient is treated should be avoided.",

      "abstract": "Some patients with cancer pain may develop uncontrolled adverse effects, including generalized myoclonus, delirium, nausea and emesis, or severe sedation before achieving adequate analgesia during opioid dose titration. Sequential therapeutic trials should be considered to determine the most favorable drug.Recent literature was taken into account when reviewing the rationale and potential of opioid rotation.When aggressive attempts to prevent adverse effects fail, drug rotation should be considered, because sequential therapeutic trials can be useful in identifying the most favorable drug. Different mechanisms, including receptor activity, the asymmetry in cross-tolerance among different opioids, different opioid efficacies, and accumulation of toxic metabolites can explain the differences in analgesic or adverse effect responses among opioids in a clinical setting.When pain is relieved inadequately by opioid analgesics given in a dose that causes intolerable side effects despite routine measures to control them, treatment with the same opioid by an alternative route or with an alternative opioid administered by the same route should be considered. Opioid rotation may be useful in opening the therapeutic window and for establishing a more advantageous analgesia/toxicity relationship. By substituting opioids and using lower doses than expected according to the equivalency conversion tables, it is possible in the majority of cases to reduce or relieve the symptoms of opioid toxicity in those patients who were highly tolerant to previous opioids while improving analgesia and, as a consequence, the opioid responsiveness.",

As such, the appropriate assessment and treatment of sleep disorders, particularly in older populations, are vital. Carefully considered sleep diaries and histories are essential diagnostic tools; comorbid problems such as pain or depression and current medications should be considered as possible causes.

      "title": "Adolescents and adults with FOXP1 syndrome show high rates of anxiety and externalizing behaviors but not psychiatric decompensation or skill loss",
      "abstract": "FOXP1 syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with complex clinical presentations including global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual disability, speech and language impairment, autism traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a range of behavioral challenges. To date, much of the literature focuses on childhood symptoms and little is known about the FOXP1 syndrome phenotype in adolescence or adulthood. A series of caregiver interviews and standardized questionnaires assessed psychiatric and behavioral features of 20 adolescents and adults with FOXP1 syndrome. Clinical interviews captured change in various psychiatric manifestations over time. Medication, social, educational, and vocational history was collected, and visual analog scales measured top caregiver concerns during childhood and adolescence/adulthood. Anxiety and externalizing behaviors were common in this cohort and psychiatric features, such as psychosis or bipolar symptoms, were present in two participants. There was no reported regression or loss of skills, early in development or during adolescence/adulthood. Medication use was common particularly for features of ADHD, although multiple trials were required for some individuals to achieve benefit. Standardized assessments accurately picked up on externalizing symptoms and were less sensitive to internalizing symptoms. Educational setting varied up until late elementary school and gradually shifted to special education. Cognitive and developmental concerns were reported as primary during childhood and independence/safety and housing concerns became top concerns by adolescence/adulthood. Caregivers reported continued development in adaptive skills even into adulthood. Taken together, results are reassuring, with many families reporting their adolescent and adult children continued to gain skills over time, particularly related to increased independence in communication and personal care. There were no reports of developmental regression, neuropsychiatric decompensation or catatonia.",

      "title": "Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) for Spasticity in Patients With Acquired Brain Injury [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Acquired brain injury is an umbrella term that encompasses traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and non-traumatic brain injuries. Approximately 150,000 Canadians will sustain an ABI on an annual basis. An ABI is damage to the brain that is not due to a congenital or degenerative disorder. Occurring after birth, ABI can be caused by a traumatic event or external force (e.g., motor vehicle accident, sports injury), or a non-traumatic event or internal factor (e.g., infection, tumour). Injury to the brain can result in temporary or permanent physical (e.g., movement issues, spasticity, chronic pain), cognitive (e.g., impaired speech, memory loss), and/or emotional (e.g., depression, anger issues) impairments.As 1 of the major physical impairments resulting from an ABI, muscle spasticity is often described as muscle over-activity and is characterized by ongoing muscle contractions that are partly due to a decrease in skeletal stretch reflex threshold. Occurring spontaneously or continuously, spasticity typically affects muscles in the neck and upper and lower limbs. Spasticity can result in a variety of musculoskeletal issues such as involuntary shaking, joint stiffness, muscle contracture, and limited range of movement. This debilitating condition may limit one’s ability to perform the activities of daily living, impact one’s quality of life, and require additional assistance from caregivers.The treatment of ABI-related spasticity can involve a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological options may include casting and splinting to maintain positioning, stretching and strengthening to improve control of spastic muscles, and/or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation to help reduce pain. Pharmacological options can be administered systemically (e.g., oral baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, dantrolene sodium) or locally (e.g., injection of botulinum toxin type A [BoNT-A], phenol, baclofen). Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a neurotoxic protein produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, exists in multiple subtypes (i.e., A to G) and formulations.BoNT-A intramuscular injection is used to treat spasticity by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in activating skeletal muscles. BoNT-A injections result in temporary local paresis (i.e., partial paralysis) and may help to improve pain. BoNT-A is approved for various indications (i.e., not exclusive to spasticity), and is available as 3 formulations in North America: onabotulinum toxin A (Botox), abobotulinum toxin A (Dysport), and incobotulinum toxin A (Xeomin). Due to different manufacturing processes and pharmacological activities, these 3 formulations are not considered interchangeable products. This report focuses on onabotulinum toxin A, which will be referred to herein as Botox — its brand name.The body of evidence evaluating treatment options for spasticity after brain injury is limited in quality and quantity, and there is uncertainty regarding the clinical effectiveness of Botox for this population. Another 2021 CADTH rapid review report focused on the use of Botox for the treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. The aim of this rapid review report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of Botox for the treatment of ABI-associated spasticity.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

      "title": "Secondary headache attributed to exposure to or overuse of a substance",
      "abstract": "Background Secondary headaches attributed to exposure to or the overuse of a substance are classified under chapter eight in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

It is extremely incapacitating, and frequently results in impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced work performance. Currently there is no cure for narcolepsy, so treatment focuses on control of symptoms. (2) Although the sympathomimetic stimulants, such as amphetamines or methylphenidate, are effective in improving excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy, they have the potential for dependence, have sometimes disabling sympathomimetic side-effects and are associated with tolerance. (3) To date, there is clear evidence of the efficacy of modafinil, armodafinil and sodium oxybate in patients with narcolepsy. Modafinil and armodafinil improve excessive daytime sleepiness symptoms and have little abuse potential, but have no effect on cataplexy, so other drugs, such as antidepressants, are required to control cataplexy attacks.

      "title": "[Mechanism of nicotine dependence].",
      "abstract": "This article reviews the current studies on the mechanism of nicotine dependence. In the process of nicotine dependence, there are four major determinants: reinforcing effects, tolerance, craving and withdrawal. 1) The positive reinforcing effects of nicotine are important especially for the initiation of nicotine self-administration. These effects are considered to be induced by the ability of nicotine to promote the release of catecholamines, acetylcholine, beta-endorphine, glucocorticoid, and other kinds of hormones. 2) However, tolerance gradually develops to the positive reinforcing effects of nicotine, as nicotine is repeatedly self-administered. 3) Craving is defined as the uncontrollability of the urge to take drugs, which is a core aspect of recent ICD-10 or DSM-IV descriptions. Craving for nicotine is caused and enhanced by the following three factors; psychic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression and dysphoria, conditioning processes leading to the association of nicotine effects with environmental stimuli, and memory of the reinforcing effects of nicotine. 4) Neither somatic withdrawal symptoms nor mental disorders related to nicotine dependence is significant. 5) As for the neurobiology of nicotine dependence, the reward system is focused as a putative responsible region involved not only in the reinforcing effects of nicotine but also in the psychic withdrawal symptoms. The amygdala-nucleus accumbens connection may be intimately involved in the association between nicotine effects and environmental stimuli. And neuronal circuits involved in memory function may be implicated in the manifestation of craving and relapse, but the details remain to be solved.",

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position.

Fragmentation and repetitive arousals/awakenings characterize the sleep of persons with dementia. Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

      "title": "Problems with Object Permanence: Rethinking Traditional Beliefs Associated with Poor Theory of Mind in Autism",
      "abstract": "Poor Theory of Mind (ToM) (or difficulties imputing mental states to self and others) [1], (See also [2-5]) is often blamed for certain responses and behaviour in autism. However, the Theory of Mind Task Battery requires an understanding of language, the use of cognitive skills, as well as the child’s motivation and attention to complete. All of these factors are either weak or under-developed in individuals with autism suggesting that this is not the best means to measure one’s understanding that other people have their own thoughts, plans, beliefs, or point of view. Behaviours like strong defiance, insistence on sameness, fear associated with sudden change and severe anxiety may be related to difficulties seeing beyond the ‘now’ [6]. This paper suggests that some of the stress and anxiety in the autism population may actually be due to delayed object permanence (OP) (knowing something may still exist even if it is out of sight), which can appear as poor ToM. This delay in establishing OP is governed by single focused attention. For more information on this concept see: Lawson, W. (2011) The passionate mind, JKP:London. Although ToM and OP are defined differently, this paper aims to show the relationship between them and how one concept can influence the other using examples in everyday life to illustrate how poor OP is associated with single focused attention, which detracts from the bigger picture.",

CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale) value was 42. This case was treated at the Department of Kaumarabhritya, Government Ayurveda College, Tripunithura and there was much improvement in eye contact, jumping and laughing reduced, the patient started to speak a few new words, attention improved and CARS Value reduced to 36 after treatment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. It can be correlated to Unmada in Ayurveda. Impaired agni (digestive fire) is a cardinal feature in Autism which is due to abnormal microbiota Autism. Correction of Agni by Deepana, Pachana which corrects the dysbiosis of microbiota along with the adoption of treatment principles of Unmada can bring about much improvement in the signs and symptoms of Autism.",

      "abstract": "The robust associations between suicide and substances arise because alcohol or other drug use functions as both a chronic risk factor for suicidality, and an acute precipitant of suicidal behaviour. Chronic drug use substantially increases the risk of experiencing mental health problems such as depression or psychosis, which are themselves significant risk factors for suicide, particularly when they co-occur with substance use disorders. Moreover, independent of the influence of mental illness, substance use disorders themselves increase the risk of suicide, possibly due to alterations in neurotransmitter levels.",

In obstetric anesthesia care, it has also been associated with improved maternal mortality and major morbidity. The majority of neurological adverse events following regional anesthesia administration result in temporary sensory symptoms; long-term or permanent disabling motor and sensory problems are very rare. Infection and hemorrhagic complications, particularly with neuraxial blocks, can cause neurological adverse events. More commonly, however, there are no associated secondary factors and some combination of needle trauma, intraneural injection, and/or local anesthetic toxicity may be associated, but their individual contributions to any event are difficult to define.",

In this article, the last of a four-part series, the discontinuation effects of the following psychotropic drugs are described: benzodiazepine drugs (which have hypnotic, anti-anxiety, and anticonvulsant effects), non-benzodiazepine drugs (used for insomnia), glutamate-modulating drugs, opioid receptor agonist drugs (used as analgesics for the treatment of various pain conditions), and stimulant drugs. Serious adverse effects are likely to occur only after abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepine drugs, and they should almost always be tapered. Prominent discontinuation effects are seen with opioid and stimulant drugs, but these are usually not serious. Tapering medication, rather than abruptly stopping them, can avoid or minimize the potential adverse discontinuation effects associated with most psychotropic drugs.",

      "title": "Bipolar depression: the clinical characteristics and unmet needs of a complex disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective: We reviewed important clinical aspects of bipolar depression, a progressive psychiatric condition that is commonly treated in primary care. Bipolar depression is associated with considerable burden of illness, high suicide risk, and greater morbidity and mortality than bipolar mania.Methods: We identified articles relevant to our narrative review using a multistep search of the literature and applying terms that were relevant to bipolar depression or bipolar disorder.Results: Bipolar depression accounts for the majority of time spent unwell for patients with bipolar disorder; high rates of morbidity and mortality arise from full symptomatic episodes and interepisode subsyndromal symptoms. Bipolar depression is an important contributor to long-term dysfunction for patients with bipolar disorder due to psychosocial impairment, loss of work productivity and high rates of substance abuse. Missed and delayed diagnosis is prevalent due to overlapping symptoms with unipolar depression and other diagnoses. Medical comorbidities (i.e. cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome) and psychiatric comorbidities (i.e. anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are common. Currently, only three treatments are FDA-approved for bipolar depression; monotherapy antidepressants are not a recommended treatment option.Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is common among primary care patients presenting with depression; it is often treated exclusively in primary care. Clinicians should be alert for symptoms of bipolar disorder in undiagnosed patients, know what symptoms probabilistically suggest bipolar versus unipolar depression, have expertise in providing ongoing treatment to diagnosed patients, and be knowledgeable about managing common medication-related side effects and comorbidities. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical.",

      "title": "Bereavement: Signs, Symptoms, and Course",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In his paper “Mourning and Melancholia,” Freud described five features of melancholia, “ … a profoundly painful dejection, cessation of interest in the outside world, loss of the capacity to love, inhibition of all activity, and a lowering of the self-regarding feelings to a degree that finds utterance in self-reproaches and self-revilings, and culminates in a delusional expectation of punishment. He felt that mourning includes these same symptoms, except for the last. Freud believed that mourning is not a pathological condition and that it subsides with time; interfering with it was useless and potentially harmful. Indeed, the loss of a loved one is a universal experience that may be one of the most significant and traumatic life events that people face. Nevertheless, most people cope with loss with minimal morbidity. For a minority, the death of a loved one may lead to increased use of substances (alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other hypnotics), the development of a psychiatric illness like chronic depression, or even greater mortality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paula L.

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "title": "First oral treatment zuranolone’s FDA approval and its impact on postpartum depression: a new hope – a correspondence",
      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of mood disorder that affects some individuals after they give birth. It is characterized by a range of emotional and physical symptoms that can significantly impact a new parent's well-being, their ability to care for their baby, and their overall quality of life. PPD typically occurs within the first few weeks or months after childbirth, but it can develop anytime during the first year. New parents with PPD often experience intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness. Irritability, mood swings, and excessive crying are also common. PPD can manifest with physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite (either overeating or loss of appetite), and disruptions in sleep patterns (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much). Individuals with PPD might have trouble concentrating, making decisions, or focusing on tasks1. PPD affects a significant number of new parents in the United States. It is estimated that around one in seven women (or about 14–20%) experience PPD after giving birth. Women who have previously experienced PPD are at a higher risk of experiencing it again with subsequent pregnancies. The recurrence rate for PPD is estimated to be around 30–50%. Many cases of PPD go undiagnosed and untreated. Only about 15% of individuals with PPD receive professional help2. In 2017, a research study revealed that suicide constituted ~5% of perinatal fatalities among Canadian women, predominantly happening within the initial 3 months following childbirth due to PPD3. Current treatment of PPD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline and fluoxetine are commonly prescribed for PPD (Table 1). Table 1 - Pharmacological treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often considered first-line treatments for postpartum depression (PPD). They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) SNRIs like venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) also affect serotonin levels, but they additionally impact norepinephrine. These medications can be effective for PPD in some cases. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) While less commonly prescribed due to potential side effects, TCAs like amitriptyline and nortriptyline may be considered when other options are not effective or well-tolerated. Atypical antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an example of an atypical antidepressant that affects both dopamine and norepinephrine. It can be used as an alternative for individuals who have not responded to SSRIs or SNRIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs like phenelzine (Nardil) are usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed due to their potential interactions with certain foods and medications. Yet, these medications can take weeks to work and may lead to side effects. Concerns about breastfeeding can also impact treatment decisions. Estrogen therapy stabilizes hormone levels linked to PPD, but it is still being studied, and its risks and side effects need more investigation. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps manage PPD symptoms by changing negative thought patterns. However, access to qualified therapists can be limited, and attending regular sessions might be challenging for new mothers. Recently FDA approved first oral treatment of zuranolone to treat PPD4. Zuranolone belongs to a class of drugs known as positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. GABA-A receptors are critical components of the central nervous system that play a crucial role in regulating mood, anxiety, and other emotional states. Zuranolone's mechanism of action involves enhancing the activity of GABA-A receptors. GABA-A receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, and their activation leads to a reduction in neuronal excitability, thereby promoting relaxation and calming effects. By acting as a positive allosteric modulator, zuranolone amplifies the response of GABA-A receptors to the neurotransmitter GABA, resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant effects4. For treating PPD, the efficacy of Zurzuvae in adults was assessed by conducting two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and multicenter studies5. During this phase 3 trial with a double-blind design, women experiencing severe PPD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a daily dosage of 50 mg zuranolone or a placebo for a period of 14 days. The primary focus of the study was to assess the change in the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from their initial state on day 15. Noteworthy secondary objectives included measuring changes in HAM-D scores on days 3, 28, and 45, as well as evaluating the alteration in severity based on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-S) on day 15. Throughout the trial, adverse events were closely monitored and recorded. Among the 196 patients who were randomly assigned (zuranolone, N=98; placebo, N=98), a total of 170 participants (86.7%) successfully completed the 45-day study period. The utilization of zuranolone in comparison to the placebo yielded statistically notable enhancements in depressive symptoms by day 15. Moreover, significant amelioration in depressive symptoms was also noted5. Zuranolone can be more discreet and less stigmatizing compared to other forms of treatment, such as injections or hospital visits. This may encourage more individuals to seek help for their PPD symptoms. It will have higher rates of patient compliance since they are simple to take and integrate into daily routines. It can be distributed through a wider range of healthcare settings, potentially increasing accessibility to PPD treatment in both urban and rural areas. It can provide flexibility in dosing, allowing healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans to the individual needs of each patient. It can facilitate early intervention for PPD and has the potential to reduce hospitalization. Although zuranolone's FDA approval for PPD is promising, there are still some challenges to consider for its use. Not all individuals may respond equally to zuranolone, leading to variations in its effectiveness. Some women might experience significant improvements, while others might not see the same results. Like any medication, zuranolone could potentially have side effects ranging from mild to severe. Balancing the benefits with the potential risks is essential. The long-term effects of using zuranolone, especially during the postpartum period, need further exploration. Monitoring its impact on both maternal health and infant development is crucial. The accessibility of zuranolone could be a concern, as new medications might initially have a higher cost and limited availability, potentially limiting access for some individuals. Zuranolone's interactions with other medications or treatments that postpartum women might be taking should be thoroughly studied to avoid any adverse effects. PPD is a complex condition that can vary greatly between individuals. Finding the right dosage and treatment plan tailored to each woman's needs might require careful consideration. While zuranolone offers a pharmacological approach, it is important not to overlook the benefits of psychosocial interventions, such as therapy and support groups, in the overall treatment plan. Overcoming the stigma associated with PPD and seeking help is a challenge. Some women might be hesitant to use medication due to concerns about judgment or societal perceptions. Healthcare providers need to be adequately educated about zuranolone and its potential benefits and limitations to make informed decisions and provide comprehensive care. Determining the appropriate duration of zuranolone treatment and ensuring a smooth transition to other forms of support after discontinuation are important aspects to address. There remains a need for comprehensive studies that delve deeper into its long-term effects, interactions with other medications, and its impact on diverse populations. Rigorous clinical trials and longitudinal studies can provide invaluable insights into the treatment's efficacy, safety, and potential limitations. The approval of zuranolone could potentially have a broader impact beyond its application in PPD. As researchers and clinicians gain a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, there is a possibility that zuranolone's insights may extend to other mental health conditions.

It is associated with several medical conditions and its prevalence increases with age. Treatment is specific to cause. Drug-induced OH often can be alleviated by reducing dosage or completely changing medications. OH secondary to autonomic insufficiency or neurogenic causes remains a challenge to manage, and a combination of non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic measures are needed. Recommendations are made for preventive measures, patient and caregiver education, and nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to treatment. Approaches to managing OH in conjunction with hypertension are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The psychotropic drugs responsible for side effects on the gastrointestinal tract are essentially those that develop the most effective anticholinergic actions. But also to be taken into account are the depression of the central nervous system, the alpha adrenergic effects and the indirect results of the relief of the anxiety and depression symptoms. In spite of the anti-emetic properties of the antipsychotic drugs, nauseas and vomiting appear as frequently as with placebos. The antipsychotic and antidepressive drugs provoke dysphagia and achalasia, because of a loss of tonus. Some cases of hiatal hernia are attributed to tricyclic antidepressants. The latter drugs, as well as IMOA and aliphatic and piperidinated phenothiazines, induce constipation in psychiatric patients, who are already prone to it. Even ileus may occur, or dilatation of the bowel or the stomach. Diarrhea is rare. Patients treated with psychotropics often complain of a dry mouth (xerostomy). This unpleasant sensation is succesfully treated with betanechol (75 mg/d) which does not impair - as pilocarpine does - the therapeutic effects. Dental caries, moniliasis and parotidites have been attributed to neuroleptic drugs or tricyclic antidepressants, on account of the inhibition of the salivary flow. Vomiting, diarrhea and epigastric burning appear in 10% of the patients treated with lithium (even when the posology is correct).",

The etiology of these symptoms is complex; there may be autonomic and pelvic nerve dysfunction (with attenuation of voluntary motor function and impaired anorectal sensation and anorectal reflexes), or generalized systemic factors (e.g., altered diet and behavior, impaired mobility, psychological disturbances or drug adverse effects). The mainstay of current treatment is adapting a conservative approach towards reversing the systemic effects and optimizing the mechanics of defecation through the use of laxatives and irrigation approaches. When successful, this approach improves both evacuation and incontinence symptoms, with associated improvements in quality of life and independence. Future therapies may be directed at modulating pelvic innervation through electrical stimulation. Stoma formation remains an option for patients refractory to other approaches.",

      "title": "Opioids and opioid receptors; understanding pharmacological mechanisms as a key to therapeutic advances and mitigation of the misuse crisis",
      "abstract": "Opioids are a mainstay in acute pain management and produce their effects and side effects (e.g., tolerance, opioid-use disorder and immune suppression) by interaction with opioid receptors. I will discuss opioid pharmacology in some controversial areas of enquiry of anaesthetic relevance. The main opioid target is the µ (mu,MOP) receptor but other members of the opioid receptor family, δ (delta; DOP) and κ (kappa; KOP) opioid receptors also produce analgesic actions. These are naloxone-sensitive. There is important clinical development relating to the Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (NOP) receptor, an opioid receptor that is not naloxone-sensitive. Better understanding of the drivers for opioid effects and side effects may facilitate separation of side effects and production of safer drugs. Opioids bind to the receptor orthosteric site to produce their effects and can engage monomer or homo-, heterodimer receptors. Some ligands can drive one intracellular pathway over another. This is the basis of biased agonism (or functional selectivity). Opioid actions at the orthosteric site can be modulated allosterically and positive allosteric modulators that enhance opioid action are in development. As well as targeting ligand-receptor interaction and transduction, modulating receptor expression and hence function is also tractable. There is evidence for epigenetic associations with different types of pain and also substance misuse. As long as the opioid narrative is defined by the 'opioid crisis' the drive to remove them could gather pace. This will deny use where they are effective, and access to morphine for pain relief in low income countries.",

It is not uncommon to occur co-morbidly between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders. This association is poorly understood. Recent findings indicate that anxiety disorders also are associated with typical symptoms of narcolepsy. Objectives Study of the comorbidity between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders, like anxiety, through a clinical case. Methods A 21-year-old female patient with no psychiatric history who consulted due to anxiety and panic attacks related to poor narcolepsy control. Debut of the neurological disease during adolescence with frequent cataplexy attacks that condition their daily activity and generate avoidance behaviors and agoraphobia. Results The patient complained of poor quality of sleep and reported a large number of different types of situations (eg, surprise, embarrassment) associated with cataplectic events. Treatment with SSRIs first and bupropion with pregabalin later was partially effective. Recent studies suggest efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation. Conclusions Anxiety disorders, especially panic attacks and social phobias, often affect patients with narcolepsy. Anxiety and mood symptoms could be secondary complications of the chronic symptoms of narcolepsy. Recent studies have shown that narcolepsy is caused by defective hypocretin signaling. As hypocretin neurotransmission is also involved in stress regulation and addiction, this raises the possibility that mood and anxiety symptoms are primary disease phenomena in narcolepsy. Recent studies suggest that vagus nerve stimulation could be potentially useful in the treatment of resistant depressive and anxiety disorder and it is not a contraindication in patients with narcolepsy.

      "abstract": "O delirium do despertar (DD) e uma complicacao da anestesia geral muito comum em criancas. Caracteriza-se por uma alteracao do comportamento e/ou da cognicao no periodo pos-operatorio imediato. Apresenta-se como disturbio da consciencia e da atencao em relacao ao ambiente, com desorientacao e alteracoes perceptivas, incluindo hipersensibilidade aos estimulos e comportamentos motores hiperativos. A incidencia pode ser acima de 80%. Os fatores de risco incluem a idade pre-escolar, uso de sevoflurano, cirurgias oftalmologicas e otorrinolaringologicas. O diagnostico e clinico e baseado em escalas. A unica escala validada e a Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED). A prevencao e a melhor abordagem. Alfa-2 agonistas, propofol e a anestesia venosa total sao as principais formas de prevencao farmacologica. O tratamento e instituido em casos selecionados. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a incidencia de DD em criancas submetidas a adenoidectomia com ou sem tonsilectomia. Foram ainda avaliadas as incidencias de outras complicacoes, dor (Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale - CHEOPS), tempo para o despertar, tempo para a alta da sala de recuperacao pos-anestesica (SRPA), concordância interobservador para a escala PAED e satisfacao dos pais. Metodos: estudo prospectivo e observacional que incluiu criancas entre um e nove anos de idade e estado fisico ASA 1 ou 2. Todas as criancas receberam clonidina via oral 4 mcg/kg uma hora antes da inducao. A inducao foi feita com oxido nitroso/oxigenio e sevoflurano. Apos puncao do acesso venoso periferico, foram administrados fentanil 2 mcg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg e lidocaina 2 mg/kg. A anestesia era mantida com sevoflurano. A crianca era extubada acordada. Dois avaliadores independentes aplicavam a escala PAED no 1o, 10o, 20o e 30o e CHEOPS no 10o, 20o e 30o minuto posextubacao. PAED e CHEOPS 10 indicam DD e dor, respectivamente. Resultados: 72 criancas foram incluidas. A mediana da idade foi de 4,25 anos (IQ 25-75% 2,9-6,3). Pontuacao 10 na escala PAED foi recebida por 13 criancas, com incidencia de DD de 18%. Pontuacao 10 na CHEOPS foi recebida por cinco criancas. O coeficiente Kappa para a escala PAED foi de 0,83 para o 1o minuto pos-extubacao e 1 para os demais tempos. Laringoespasmo foi registrado em sete criancas. Uma delas apresentou hipotensao e outra bradicardia; uma crianca teve vomitos. A mediana do tempo para extubacao e alta da SRPA foi de 18 (IQ 25-75% 15-22) e 60 (IQ 25-75% 60-68) minutos, respectivamente. A maioria dos pais (98,6%) declarou estar muito satisfeita. Conclusao: a incidencia de DD foi baixa quando se compara a literatura, provavelmente devido ao uso da clonidina via oral como medicacao pre-anestesica. DD e complicacao comum em anestesia pediatrica e medidas de prevencao devem ser tomadas em pacientes de alto risco. A escala PAED e a unica validada para diagnostico e foi observada concordância perfeita entre os avaliadores. Apesar de ser uma complicacao autolimitada, ainda nao se sabe o impacto do DD no comportamento e cognicao da crianca, sendo recomendados a estratificacao do risco, o diagnostico correto e a instituicao de medidas de prevencao.",

      "abstract": "We have all encountered the following postanesthesia care unit dilemma a myriad of times. As the attending covering the postanesthesia care unit, the anesthesiologist will be confronted not infrequently with the following clinical scenario: \"He needed 500 μg fentanyl in the operating room for a toe amputation and has received 20 mg morphine, and he's still complaining of severe pain…. Do you think he may need more morphine?\" Opiates do prevail as first-line therapy for moderate to severe surgical and chronic pain states. However, their use may actually confound the clinical picture postoperatively, because opiate exposure counterintuitively may actually trigger exaggerated pain sensation. When assessing a patient experiencing exaggerated postoperative or chronic pain, several questions should come to mind. First, is this patient experiencing tolerance or hyperalgesia induced by opiate therapy? Second, does the management differ for the two etiologies? Third, what underlying mechanisms, both at the neuroanatomic and molecular/chemical levels, underlie the two processes? Fourth, how does the recent literature on opiate-induced hyperalgesia influence previously accepted views of pre-emptive analgesia? Fifth, what treatment modalities exist for opiate-induced hyperalgesia? Most importantly, sixth, how can opiate-induced hyperalgesia be prevented? In this literature review, we aim to address these questions and to hopefully change the current perception and management of perioperative and chronic pain states with opiates.",

In vision, age-related changes are seen in contrast sensitivity, scotopic processing, and visual processing speed, which have consequences for activities such as reading and driving. Aging is also associated with changes in smell, taste, and balance. Beyond simple perceptual processing, age-related sensory changes can increase cognitive demands, requiring greater involvement of domain-general cognitive processes during perception that reduce resources available for other operations.

      "abstract": "Planned discontinuation or acute unplanned cessation of oral dopaminergic medications might result in a severe relapse of Parkinson's symptoms or, sporadically, in life-limiting withdrawal syndromes. Unplanned cessation may occur due to dysphagia or decreased alertness, amongst other reasons. Planned acute discontinuation occurs during surgery or a medical necessity for a ‘nil per os’ policy (such as hospitalizations for gastrointestinal diseases). Non-oral alternatives are available, such as transdermal rotigotine, subcutaneous apomorphine, and levodopa delivered subcutaneously or via an enteral tube. Selecting the best treatment can be difficult and should be based upon clinical considerations, patient preference and be tailored to the care setting. These considerations will differ during the course of disease. For example, more invasive treatment options can be considered in hospitalized persons with early to moderate-stage disease, whereas symptomatic palliative treatments are more appropriate towards the end of life. Here, we discuss several practical considerations for three, partially overlapping, but conceptually distinct moments at which acute discontinuation or cessation events occur: during hospitalization (including surgery), late-stage disease and end of life. We stress the need for prevention and early advance care planning and present a stepwise pharmacological approach to address unplanned acute cessation or planned discontinuation.",

Estas alteraciones pueden preceder a las propias crisis epilépticas, constituyendo la primera manifestación de una disfunción cerebral específica o global, que se manifestará luego como una epilepsia propiamente tal. En otras ocasiones, estas alteraciones pueden ser secundarias a las características de la patología, como tipo y frecuencia de crisis; a los efectos adversos a los fármacos antiepilépticos; a los trastornos neuropsiquiátricos comúnmente asociados con esta patología, y/o a las alteraciones psico-sociales y académicas asociadas. Los neuropsicólogos participamos en la evaluación de las repercusiones cognitivas, emocionales, conductuales y sociales, para apoyar en el proceso diagnóstico y, sobre todo en el manejo integral de cada paciente, con el objetivo de mejorar su calidad de vida. Cognitive, behavioral and emotional disturbances are the rule rather than the exception in patients with epilepsy. These abnormalities may even precede the seizures themselves and though this might be a reflection of the dysfunction of a specific brain region or, in some cases, a diffuse brain disorder that is global, which manifests itself later as epilepsy. These alterations may reflect the adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs or neuropsychiatric disorders commonly associated with this condition, such as mood or anxiety disorders, among others. Neuropsychologists participate in the evaluation of the cognitive and behavioral manifestations in these patients in order to assist in the diagnosis and in integrated management with the aim of improving their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

The seizures typically occurred several hours after his last alcohol intake at home (early withdrawal seizure) and 22 days after his last intake of alcohol (14 days after the last dose of diazepam substituting for alcohol: late withdrawal seizure) on the ward. Psychiatrists in charge of this patient found it difficult to attribute his seizures to alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) because of the atypical onset. The patient responded to diazepam resumption and valproate combination. This case highlights the need to always consider AWS as a possible cause of seizures and to gradually decrease diazepam as a substitute for alcohol. Moreover, in this patient, MCI may have induced vulnerability in the brain for AWS and the patients' older age might have decreased liver function leading to delayed onset of the seizures after diazepam withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "The two primary symptoms of chronic ear disease are otorrhea and hearing loss. The goal of any tympanoplasty is to eradicate disease and improve hearing. These are the primary indications for this procedure. The success or failure of the surgery is influenced by many factors such as the age and general health of the patient, the extent and type of disease present, and whether the upper airway is functioning properly. Contraindications to tympanoplasty will vary from one surgeon to another depending upon his training, philosophy, experience, and surgical skill. It is helpful to think of these contraindications as being either absolute or relative. Absolute contraindications consist of: 1. uncontrolled cholesteatoma; 2. malignant tumors; 3. unusual infections and/or extenuating circumstances; and 4. complications of chronic ear disease, such as meningitis, brain abscess, or lateral sinus thrombosis. Relative contraindications are less well defined: 1. eustachian tube insufficiency or non-function; 2. the uncooperative patient; 3. the dead ear; 4. the better hearing or only hearing ear; 5. the elderly patient; 6. the young child; and 7. the repeated failure case. The otologic surgeon must exercise good clinical judgment in selecting patients for tympanoplasty. This paper deals with some of the more common problems in decision making.",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

Symptoms start shortly after the triggering acoustic incident and can be short-lived or can last for a considerable time. If persistent, the condition can lead to significant disability. Proposed mechanisms include involvement of the tensor tympani muscle, hyperexcitability of central auditory pathways, and a precursive state of raised anxiety or arousal.

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

Here we present the case of a 57-year-old man who presented to our memory clinic with progressive cognitive decline and a prior neuropsychological evaluation supporting the diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder. He was taking multiple psychotropic medications at the time, but the exact dosages were unclear due to a lack of collateral history. He was also taking prescribed opioids and a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone for pain relief, again with unclear dosages at the time of presentation. Brain imaging and cerebrospinal spinal fluid biomarker testing were negative for Alzheimer pathophysiologic processes. Months later, the patient was taken to the emergency room after an overdose caused by overuse of opioid medications. Once he was taken off all psychoactive medications, the patient’s cognitive impairment completely reversed, and he became independent in activities of daily living. Psychotropic polypharmacy can have a myriad of cognitive manifestations which need to be better recognized by clinicians. Deprescription of such medications should be attempted whenever clinically appropriate.",

      "abstract": "Urgency for this paper is the result of over 4,000 neuropsychological evaluations conducted by the author, in addition to the author’s past behavioral research in addictions and impulsiveness. The following trends are discussed. First, there is a large number of teens and adults convinced they exhibit symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); they want medications (psychostimulants) to cure the symptoms. Second, many of the gatekeepers of medication management (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) are bombarded with requests for extensive cocktails of psychotropics, and particularly for the psychostimulants. Third, medical specialists delay fulfilment or renewal of psychostimulants by referring the patients for neuropsychological evaluations. High volume testing shows that symptoms reported as ADHD are, frequently, manifestations of other pervasive conditions. These conditions include Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Adult Children of Alcoholics/Adult Children of Family Abuse, Medical Conditions, Addictions, and Psychotropic Effects. This article examines the limitations of neuropsychological evaluations, other etiologies responsible for such look-alike or copycat ADHD symptoms, and the problem when reified ADHD symptoms are treated with innovative technologies.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria.

El registro del grado de agitacion en una escala de 100 puntos, proporciona la retroalimentacion necesaria para proseguir, revalorar, o concluir el tratamiento, dependiendo de los resultados obtenidos. Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol.

Secondary OP, mostly generalised, is diagnosed in the course of such hormonal disturbances as: primary hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hyperadrenalocorticalism. Another group of diseases implicating OP are connective tissue pathologies: congenital (osteogenesis imperfecta, collagenopathies) and acquired (juvenile chronic arthritis). A serious problem for a paediatrician is the iatrogenic OP resulting from a long-term use of some medicines (glucocorticosteroids) or long-lasting immobilization for surgical and orthopaedic reasons, or from chronic general diseases. Osteoporosis accompanying pathological states of the skeletal and nervous systems (with paralyses and pareses) is particularly intensive and difficult for treatment. Osteoporosis in developmental age may cause disturbances in natural development of the skeleton, which leads to deformities in the skeletal system and to the formation of faulty postures. Lower body height is a frequent complication resulting from OP in children and the youth. In OP diagnostics the densitometry test is of the basic importance, the most common method is dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and the diagnosis criterion is the decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) greater than 2 SD. It should be taken into account also the X-ray and clinical symptoms, which are similar as those observed in adults. Osteoporosis biochemical markers, however are, less significant in children because for the most of then the reference values are not determined. The OP treatment is indispensable in developmental age and it should include pharmacological therapy and the proper diet and rehabilitation as well.",

Data submitted to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects appear to indicate similar adverse reactions secondary to topical ophthalmic timolol. One hundred sixty-three of 369 central nervous system cases (44%) reported depression, psychosis, confusion, and hallucinations following topical ophthalmic timolol administration. The psychiatric community should be aware that sudden changes in mental status or onset of common psychiatric conditions, such as depression, may be due to topical ocular timolol. Withdrawal of the drug usually results in disappearance of these effects in 1 to 7 days.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of learning disabilities",
      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous diagnostic category. As a specific disorder learning disabilities include reading disorders, disorders of written expression and mathematics disorders. As a general concept, learning disabilities may be categorised into four symptom complexes, which are not mutually exclusive: 1. dyslexia, 2. motor-perceptual; 3. language delay; 4. hyperactivity. In clinical settings these neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed in school-aged children. The most common referral reasons are significant difficulties in school achievement or difficulties in child adjustment and functioning that are manifested through behavioural and emotional difficulties caused by learning disabilities. Since academic achievement is an important aspect of self-esteem in childhood, school failure may result in many short-term and long-term consequences for the child’s functioning in narrow and broader social contexts, development of maladaptive behaviour and also cause the development of psychopathology. The most common short-term consequences include low academic and general self-esteem, lack of motivation for schooling and related obligations, behavioural disorders, a sense of overload in the child, peer relationship problems and a heightened level of family conflicts. The usual long-term outcomes are psychosomatic problems, affective disorders (depression, anxiety) and severe behavioural problems. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show the persistence of certain problems in adulthood.In summary, impairments should be adequately assessed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and strengths, and a precise diagnosis should be established. Once problem areas have been identified, special teaching strategies can be devised in collaboration with the school to circumvent handicaps. Also, an important part of intervention includes counselling of parents and children.",

      "title": "Rekreacyjne używanie leków dostępnych w odręcznej sprzedaży: odurzanie i doping mózgu",
      "abstract": "Recreational substance use is becoming more common, especially among young people. Some anti-inflammatory or antitussive drugs exert potent psychoactive effects when they are used in large doses. Easily available over-the-counter (OTC) drugs may cause a range of effects including hallucinations or euphoria. Dextromethorphan (DXM) is particularly often used. At doses of 1.5–7.5 mg/kg body mass it induces stimulation, mood improvement, motor impairment, and used at doses higher than 7.5 mg/kg b.m., it exerts dissociative effects. Adverse reactions are especially clear when DXM was taken with alcohol or substances affecting metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6. Among DXM users, some cases of psychological dependence and withdrawal symptoms were observed. Long-term use of DXM may be associated with cognitive function deterioration. The abuse of Tantum Rosa (a popular gynecological anti-inflammatory drug containing benzydamine) was described mainly in Brazil, Poland and Romania. It causes hallucinations (mainly visual) and \"flashbacks\" (short-term hallucinations despite not being under the influence of the psychedelic compound). Pseudoephedrine, an amphetamine-like stimulant, produces mood improvement or even euphoria, hallucinations and psychosis. However, the real health threat is associated with the use of substances produced from pseudoephedrine: ephedrone and methamphetamine. Coraz częstszym zjawiskiem, szczególnie wśród młodzieży, jest \"rekreacyjne\" zażywanie leków. Dotyczy to m.in. przyjmowania substancji działających przeciwzapalnie lub przeciwkaszlowo, które w dużych dawkach wykazują działanie psychoaktywne. Łatwo dostępne leki w odręcznej sprzedaży mogą skutkować występowaniem całej gamy objawów, w tym omamów lub euforii. Szczególnie często zażywanym lekiem jest dekstrometorfan (DXM). W dawkach 1,5–7,5 mg/kg m.c. powoduje pobudzenie, poprawę nastroju, zaburzenia motoryczne, a w dawkach >7,5 mg/kg m.c. wykazuje działanie dysocjacyjne. Działania niepożądane są szczególnie wyraźne, gdy przyjmowany jest z alkoholem lub substancjami wpływającymi na aktywność metaboliczną izoenzymu CYP2D6 cytochromu P450. U osób stosujących DXM obserwowano przypadki uzależnienia psychicznego i występowania objawów abstynencyjnych. Długotrwałe zażywanie DXM może pogarszać funkcje kognitywne. Z kolei nadużywanie Tantum Rosa – popularnego w ginekologii preparatu benzydaminy o działaniu przeciwzapalnym, przeciwbólowym i miejscowo znieczulającym – jest opisywane głównie w Brazylii, Polsce i Rumunii. Lek ten wywołuje omamy, najczęściej wzrokowe oraz występowanie tzw. flashbacks (krótkotrwałych halucynacji pojawiających się mimo niepozostawania pod wpływem substancji psychoaktywnych). Pseudoefedryna, należąca do grupy amfetaminopodobnych stymulantów, powoduje poprawę nastroju, a nawet euforię, omamy i psychozy. Zagrożenie stanowią pozyskiwane z niej substancje o silniejszym działaniu psychoaktywnym: efedron i metamfetamina.",

      "abstract": "This is a case report of a 49 year old man admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit with symptoms of severe depression, who developed hepatic encephalopathy after being started on zolpidem. Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine that is reported to have similar sedative properties to the benzodiazepines but minimal effects as an anxiolytic, muscle relaxant or anticonvulsant. It has a rapid onset, short duration of action and is metabolized in liver through CYP450 system. Zolpidem is extensively used as a hypnotic in short term management of insomnia. There have been reports of hepatic encephalopathy induced by this medication. Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, altered level of consciousness and potentially coma and death. It results from liver failure and the accumulation of toxic substances in the blood stream such as nitrogenous waste products, of which ammonia is the most commonly measured. There is increased activity of the inhibitory gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) system and the energy supply to other brain cells is decreased. The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical one and serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90% of patients.",

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") is a unique drug, sharing properties of hallucinogens and stimulants. The acute effects of empathy, euphoria, and excitement for which it is used recreationally can make it overwhelmingly distracting for the user in the context of driving. This review considers the chemistry, synthesis, analysis, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and documented effects of MDMA on cognitive and psychomotor skills important to driving. Laboratory studies show that users do experience cognitive impairments, and may also act more impulsively while under the influence of the drug's sympathomimetic effects. Psychomotor impairment may occur with elevated doses or after repeated administration, and residual psychomotor impairment during the \"coming-down\" phase may be compounded by fatigue, dehydration, combined drug use, or other confounding factors. There is growing anecdotal information providing evidence of MDMA-impaired driving, and it is evident that many users recognize and attempt to mitigate the effects by delaying driving until the acute affects have dissipated. The drug inevitably may affect a subject's judgment and ability to properly assess their fitness to drive also. Blood concentrations in MDMA-impaired drivers suggest that this impairment can be caused by normal patterns of recreational use, and MDMA use should be considered inconsistent with safe driving immediately following ingestion, and for up to a day or longer following use.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "abstract": "Delayed awakening from anaesthesia remains one of the biggest challenges that involve anaesthesiologists. Most commonly, delayed awakening is due to drugs effects persistence. 1 The time taken to emerge to fully consciousness is affected by patient factors, anaesthetic factors, duration of surgery and painful stimulation. Non pharmacological causes may have serious sequel; thus recognising these organic conditions is important. 2 Unexpected delayed emergence after the use of general anaesthesia has a plethora of causes. 3 The most common cause for delayed awakening following anaesthesia is medications and anaesthetic agents used in the perioperative period. There may be an over dose of medications. Emergence from anaesthesia depends on the tissue uptake of the drug, average concentration used and the duration of exposure. Certain underlying metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, severe hyperglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatremia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, central cholinergic syndrome, chronic hypertension, liver disease, hypoalbuminemia, uraemia and severe hypothyroidism may also be responsible for delayed recovery after anaesthesia. Preoperative medications such as opioids and sedatives and hypothermia can further interfere with postoperative recovery. Intraoperative cerebral hypoxia, haemorrhage, embolism or thrombosis also can manifest as delayed awakening from anaesthesia. The ultimate goal of treatment is to find the cause and treat the cause, but primary management is to maintain airway, breathing and circulation.",

In the dopamine hypothesis’ simplest form, it is deduced that because antipsychotic or neuroleptic medications block dopamine function [12,64], the schizophrenic patient has a functional excess of brain dopamine. Generally, it is thought that this functional excess of dopamine is located in the limbic system. During recent years this hypothesis has been bolstered by some evidence of postsynaptic excess—namely, an increased number of brain dopamine receptors. A characterization of what this basic alteration may produce, however, is not usually attempted.",

The other major groups of TLOC are generalized epileptic seizures, “functional” or behavioral events (mimicking either epilepsy or syncope), and a group of miscellaneous disorders. Various causes of syncope may often coexist in elderly patients. Recurrent unprovoked syncope provoked by startle or exercise, or family history of epilepsy or sudden death in young patients suggest an inherited channelopathy. The evaluation of patients with TLOC consists of a careful history, physical examination, standard ECG and, in specific cases, head-up tilt test, autonomic reflex screen, Holter monitoring; echocardiogram, and video-EEG monitoring. The treatment of reflex syncope includes explanation and reassurance; avoidance of triggers; maintenance of appropriate water and sodium intake; regular exercise; and use of isometric counterpressure maneuvers.

Psychiatric comorbidity seems to increase abuse and dependence tendency more than comorbidity of medical illnesses does.

Psychiatric comorbidity is probably a poor prognostic factor for abstinence from zolpidem.",

      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "El sistema opioide –SO- (agonistas, antagonistas y sus receptores) tiene un importante papel en el procesamiento cognitivo. Los cambios en la eficiencia sinaptica de aquellas estructuras cerebrales que participan en el procesamiento de la informacion explican parte de las bases neurobiologicas de la memoria. El SO afecta considerablemente la funcion neuronal y la eficacia sinaptica de dichas estructuras. Los farmacos opiaceos empleados en la practica clinica cotidiana, tienen repercusiones positivas y negativas sobre los diferentes tipos de memoria. Los agonistas opioides pueden causar un deterioro en el procesamiento de diferentes tipos de memoria; por otro lado, el efecto de los antagonistas opioides es mucho mas complejo. En muchos de los modelos de experimentacion, el antagonismo de los receptores opioides puede tener un efecto potenciador de la memoria y facilitador de la actividad sinaptica, efecto que incluso es capaz de revertir diferentes procedimientos amnesicos. Sin embargo, la actividad tonica del SO es relevante para los procesos de aprendizaje y memoria. Por esto mismo, el bloqueo de algunos receptores opioides ya sea por metodos farmacologicos o geneticos, produce alteracion de las formas de plasticidad sinaptica involucradas con el procesamiento de la informacion y deteriora diferentes tipos de memoria. Los estudios in vitro en modelos animales y los clinicos indican que los agonistas y antagonistas opioides producen cambios en la actividad sinaptica, plasticidad y excitabilidad neuronal en estructuras que participan en el procesamiento de la memoria, lo cual se correlaciona con los trastornos cognitivos producidos por dichos farmacos en pacientes tratados de manera cronica.",

      "abstract": "When alcohol abuse occurs with depression, both the substance abuse and the mood disorder necessitate treatment. These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

Crises epilépticas podem ser confundidas com outras condições neurológicas e psiquiátricas, como síncope, crises psicogênicas, enxaqueca e narcolepsia. A síncope, uma perda temporária de consciência devido à hipoperfusão cerebral, é diferenciada das crises epilépticas pela ausência de tônus muscular e rápida recuperação. Crises psicogênicas, associadas a fatores psicológicos, têm uma duração mais longa e uma recuperação rápida. Enxaquecas compartilham fases semelhantes às crises epilépticas, mas com sintomas que evoluem gradualmente. A narcolepsia é caracterizada por sonolência diurna e cataplexia, sendo diferenciada pela ausência de alterações epilépticas no eletroencefalograma. A diferenciação adequada entre essas condições é crucial para um diagnóstico preciso e tratamento efetivo, evitando abordagens inadequadas e melhorando a qualidade de vida do paciente.",

There are many ways in which consistently disturbed sleep can affect children, both psychologically and sometimes physically; their emotional state, behaviour, and learning are likely to be affected. To establish the true nature and cause of a sleep problem, systematic enquiries need to be made (starting with the family doctor or his team) about certain key aspects of the situation; in some cases, additional information will be required from special further investigations.",

Sleep may be disturbed by the aging process, age-related medical conditions or psychiatric conditions. There are two common sleep disorders in this population: obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and restless legs syndrome. Obesity or anatomic changes with aging affecting the upper airway may cause obstructive sleep apneas, which are associated with the development of cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric disorders. Symptoms of restless legs are also prevalent in the elderly, resulting in sleep-onset insomnia or frequent nocturnal awakenings. Since sleep pathology can negatively impact cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric functions, assessment and treatment of the underlying sleep disorders may positively impact a patient's health and quality of life.",

Although tic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, systematic study of individuals with tic disorders dates from the nineteenth century. In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties. Scientific opinion has been divided on how broadly to conceive the spectrum of maladaptive behaviors associated with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) (Comings, 1988; Shapiro et al., 1988).",

      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

      "abstract": "The vulnerability and hybrid models for the onset of psychosis are presented. Familial liability, perinatal and developmental factors, and decreased cognitive performance associate with psychosis in adolescence and young adulthood. Genetic predisposition connected with behavioural deviances and/or mental symptoms associate with psychotic development so strongly that monitoring and intervention are indicated. Especially, in families where one or both parents or other family members are severely mentally ill, early family-centred assessments and interventions is needed. Together with familial psychosis, deficits in adolescent and young adult social development indicate thorough assessment, intensive monitoring and often also preventive interventions. During the prodromal phase of psychosis, patients often display unspecific symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, personality disorders, abuse of alcohol or drugs. Social decline, possibly associated with neurocognitive deficits, frequently occurs in the prodromal phase or in the early course of schizophrenia. Among help-seeking patients, occurrence of the Basic Symptoms represent the early initial prodromal state, while the late initial prodome state includes attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, and a first degree relative with psychotic disorder, or a schizotypal personality disorder, together with decrease global functioning. These patients suffer also from other mental symptoms and functional decline, and are clearly in need of psychiatric assessment and treatment. Intervention trials have shown that patients suffering from prodromal syndromes can be successfully treated, and onset of psychosis prevented or delayed. However, more large-scale studies and clinical case descriptions of treatment of patients with sub-threshold psychotic symptoms are needed.",

Vooralsnog wordt de symptoomgerichte farmacotherapeutische behandeling van ouderen met PS vormgegeven aan de hand van de multidisciplinaire richtlijn Persoonlijkheidsstoornissen, die gebaseerd is op onderzoeken bij patiënten met PS tot circa 50 jaar oud. Het ontbreekt aan een richtlijn specifiek voor ouderen.Doel: Het leveren van een beschrijving van patiëntkenmerken: aantal comorbide psychiatrische stoornissen, medicatiegebruik, inclusief polyfarmacie, bij ouderen (≥ 65 jaar) met persoonlijkheidsstoornissen.Methode: Een retrospectieve cross-sectionele dossierstudie (n = 50) binnen een topklinisch centrum voor ouderen met persoonlijkheidsstoornissen (ambulante setting).Resultaten: Uit de dossierstudie blijkt 1) de ongespecificeerde/andere gespecificeerde persoonlijkheidsstoornis en de borderline persoonlijkheidsstoornis (BPS) het meest voor te komen, 2) er een trend (geen statistisch significant verschil) te zijn dat patiënten met BPS meer somatische medicatie en psychofarmaca gebruiken en 3) er een trend (geen statistisch significant verschil) te zijn dat polyfarmacie het meest voorkomt bij oudere patiënten met BPS.Conclusie: Het medicatiegebruik in bepaalde subgroepen van ouderen met PS lijkt hoog te zijn. Vervolgonderzoek is essentieel om farmacotherapie bij ouderen met PS te verbeteren.",

La pathogenie de ces lesions se fait en deux temps, comme en temoigne l'etude du metabolisme energetique chez le rat : on observe d'abord une chute brutale et precoce des phosphates – temoin d'une chute du taux d'adenosine triphosphate (ATP) – suivie d'un retour a la normale, puis une nouvelle diminution des phosphates 8 a 15 heures apres l'agression [1]. Chez le nouveau-ne humain, l'intensite et la duree de cette deuxieme diminution des phosphates sont correlees au pronostic [2] et evoquent l'existence de plusieurs types de mort cellulaire : une precoce et une dite retardee. L'apoptose, mort « active » ou « programmee », pourrait correspondre a la mort neuronale retardee [3]. La connaissance precise des mecanismes moleculaires de cette mort apoptotique devrait permettre de proposer de nouvelles therapeutiques, qui pourraient etre administrees durant la fenetre ouverte entre les deux chutes du taux des phosphates.

      "abstract": "IntroductionPatients with renal failure often have signs and symptoms related to fluid and electrolyte disturbances, anemia, malnutrition, bone disease and gastrointestinal problems.One of those complications is the uremic encephalopathy.With the introduction of dialysis and renal transplantation, the incidence and severity of uremic encephalopathy have declined, but many patients fail to fully respond to dialytic therapy.In patients with renal failure, encephalopathy is a common problem that may be caused by uremia, thiamine deficiency, dialysis, transplant rejection, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte disturbances or drug toxicity (Mahoney & Arieff, 1982).In this chapter, the symptoms, pathophysiology and treatment of uremic encephalopathy will be discussed.Other neurological complications of renal failure are not discussed in this chapter, but were recently reviewed (Brouns & De Deyn, 2004). Clinical presentationUremic encephalopathy may accompany any form of severe acute or chronic renal failure.The clinical features appear to be related to the rate of development of renal failure.In patients with acute renal failure the symptoms are generally more pronounced and progress more rapidly than in patients with chronic renal failure (Aminoff, 1995;Burn & Bates, 1998).The symptoms begin insidiously and are often not noticed by the patients but by their family members or caregivers.Most encephalopathies are reversible, making prompt recognition and treatment important.After hemodialysis, significant improvement of uremic encephalopathy occurs, but the level of azotemia correlates poorly with the degree of neurological dysfunction (Burn & Bates, 1998). Mental statusEncephalopathy is a global cerebral dysfunction, often in the absence of primary structural brain disease.Nevertheless, in some contexts it can also lead to permanent brain injury, while in other cases it is reversible.It can be due to direct injury to the brain, or illness remote from the brain.In medical terms it can refer to a wide variety of brain disorders with very different etiologies, prognoses and implications.Uremic encephalopathy usually presents with alterations in mental status fluctuating from mild sensorial clouding to delirium and coma.Impaired attention can be tested by simple www.intechopen.comwww.intechopen.",

Os sintomas são por vezes muito inespecíficos, contudo os mais frequentes são as cefaleias, alterações da acuidade visual e diplopia no contexto de disfunção de um ou mais nervos oculares motores. Reporta-se o caso de um indivíduo do sexo masculino, 59 anos de idade, que foi referenciado ao Serviço de Urgência Otorrinolaringologia por quadro de cefaleias frontotemporais de carácter progressivo com uma semana de evolução e agravamento clínico nas últimas 12 horas associando-se diplopia. O exame neurológico sumário não releva outras alterações para além da parésia do nervo motor ocular comum esquerdo. Na rinoscopia anterior/posterior não se verificava presença de massas ou rinorreia mucopurulenta. A Tomografia Computadorizada revelava preenchimento por componente tecidual de partes moles dos seios esfenoidais e erosão do teto do seio esfenoidal esquerdo. Iniciou-se terapêutica endovenosa de largo espectro e corticoterapia sem melhoria clínica às 48 horas. Foi submetido a cirurgia endoscópica nassosinusal com boa resposta clínica e resolução completa da sintomatologia ao 10º dia pós-operatório.

The psychogenic factor as a rule is not reflected in the psychopathological structure of the disease. In the process of the disease the psychogenic influence leads to different neurotic conditions (depressive, asthenical, hysterical, phobic) which complicate the psychopathological picture of epilepsy.

Results indicate that modafinil is efficacious for sustaining/restoring objective performance and alertness during sleep deprivation with few adverse effects. At appropriate dosages, modafinil restores performance and alertness to non-sleep deprived levels. Modafinil also impairs post-sleep deprivation recovery sleep, but from the few studies available addressing this issue, it is unclear whether these sleep impairments translate into post-sleep performance impairments. Further research is needed to determine whether modafinil restores performance on simple cognitive tasks only or whether modafinil additionally restores executive functions (e.g., abstract thought, critical reasoning, planning, decision-making, situational awareness, and effective judgment) which are critical in most modern operational settings. In addition, studies are needed to determine whether modafinil use during sleep deprivation is preferable to that of other available controlled stimulants (such as dextroamphetamine) or non-controlled stimulants (such as caffeine). Such studies would be comprised of direct, head-to-head comparisons among various stimulants across a range of dosages.",

Classification of dystonia based on etiology has undergone extensive modifications as new genetic bases for some forms of dystonia and other primary neurological diseases have been identified.

Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifiable brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain.

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population.",

      "title": "Progressive Brain Atrophy due to Chronic Alcohol Abuse.",
      "abstract": "The most commonly reported findings in the brains of alcoholics are sulcal widening and ventricular enlargement as well as cortical white matter shrinkage. The frontal lobes appear to be more vulnerable to alcoholrelated brain damage than other cerebral regions. The cerebellum, cortical-limbic circuits, skeletal muscle, and peripheral nerves are also important targets of chronic alcohol-related metabolic injury and degeneration [1-3]. Although all cell types within the nervous system are vulnerable to the toxic, metabolic and degenerative effects of alcohol, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and synaptic terminals are major targets, accounting for the white matter atrophy [4]. A heavy drinking history is a cardinal feature in the criteria for alcoholic dementia, which include memory impairment in addition to one or more other cognitive symptoms. Among the cognitive symptoms are dysphasia, apraxia, agnosia, and disturbance in executive functioning [3]. All these features were found in our patient and were persistent for at least 6 months of follow-up. a 43 year-old man was brought to the emergency room with head trauma following a fall. His medical history was significant for heavy alcoholism since age 35 and related falls and injuries. Neurological examination demonstrated significant memory impairment, dysphasia, apraxia, agnosia and disturbance in executive functioning, leading to the diagnosis of alcoholic dementia. Computed tomography (CT) scan of his head repeated during 6 years demonstrated progressive central and peripheral brain atrophy with sulcal widening, ventricular enlargement, and cortical white matter shrinkage characteristic of chronic alcohol abuse [Figure 1]. Long-standing heavy alcohol abuse leads to disproportionate loss of white matter with reduction in brain volume and brain weight. Alcohol abuse is a very serious health, social and economic problem worldwide. The present case conveys a clear message regarding the brain damage that results from chronic alcohol abuse.",

The initial stable levodopa benefit, termed the “long-duration response,” begins to give way to responses increasingly tied to each dose, the so-called “short-duration response.” During the initial treatment years when long duration responses predominate, the timing of the doses is not important, except for taking them without food; doses can be missed without a decline in benefit. However, after several years or longer, the benefit begins to fluctuate; the response develops within an hour or so after each dose, persists for a few hours or less, and then declines. This concept is graphically depicted in figure 17.1. Occasional patients with long-standing Parkinson’s disease (PD) will experience responses lasting only 1–2 hours, which mirrors the plasma levodopa half-life of 1.5–2 hours.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "title": "Orthostatic intolerance after intravenous administration of morphine: incidence, haemodynamics and heart rate variability analysis",
      "abstract": "Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal peri-operative care pathway designed to counteract the pathophysiological effects of surgical stress [1]. Early postoperative mobilisation is a key concept in ERAS protocols, but it may be delayed or prevented by orthostatic intolerance. Postoperative orthostatic intolerance is defined as subjective symptoms of dizziness; nausea; blurred vision; feeling feverish; vomiting; pre-syncope; or syncope upon postural change after surgery [2]. The pathophysiology of postoperative orthostatic intolerance is not yet fully explained, but it appears to be the final common pathway for many peri-operative factors, such as inflammation; hypovolaemia; anaesthesia; pain; and opioid usage [3]. Opioids are ubiquitous in ERAS multimodal analgesic regimes, despite opioid-sparing approaches and numerous well-known side effects [4]. Opioids can potentially contribute to the development of orthostatic intolerance due to their vagotonic, pro-emetic and vestibular effects [5]. We decided to isolate and investigate the effect of morphine from other, potentially contributing, peri-operative factors by performing all measurements before surgery. This prospective observational cohort study was approved by the local ethics committee. We included 26 patients undergoing lower extremity arthroplasty. Patient flow and exclusion criteria are shown in online Supporting Information Figure S1. A pre-operative standardised mobilisation procedure consisting of supine rest (5 min), sitting (3 min), standing (3 min) and supine rest (5 min) was performed before administration of 0.1 mg.kg−1 intravenous morphine and repeated 30 min later. Patients were systematically asked questions regarding symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in each position during mobilisation. Patients not able to complete mobilisation due to intolerable orthostatic intolerance symptoms were classified as having severe orthostatic intolerance, while patients completing mobilisation despite orthostatic intolerance symptoms were classified as having non-severe orthostatic intolerance. Continuous arterial blood pressure and cerebral oxygenation were measured by LiDCO™Rapid and MasimoRoot® (Masimo, Irvine, CA, USA), respectively. The ECG was recorded continuously using CNAP®Monitor (CNSystems Medizintechnik GmbH, Graz, Austria) and heart rate variability (HRV) data were extracted and analysed using Cardiscope software (Smart Medical, Moreton in Marsh, UK) (online Supporting Information Appendix S1). The primary outcome was the incidence of orthostatic intolerance 30 min after morphine administration. Secondary outcomes were changes in haemodynamic, tissue oxygenation and HRV variables during mobilisation, before and after morphine administration. Specific data on sample size and statistics are presented in online Supporting Information Appendix S1. Before morphine administration, no patients experienced orthostatic intolerance symptoms during mobilisation. However, after intravenous administration of 0.1 mg.kg−1 morphine, 9 (38%) patients (95%CI 19–59%) experienced at least one orthostatic intolerance symptom during mobilisation at 30 min. Four (17%) patients (95%CI 5–37%) experienced severe orthostatic intolerance, terminating the mobilisation procedure prematurely due to intolerable orthostatic intolerance symptoms or pre-syncope. Two of these required treatment with ondansetron and ephedrine, respectively. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics grouped by orthostatic tolerance (online Supporting Information Table S1). Relative increases in heart rate during mobilisation were significantly attenuated in all orthostatic intolerance (p = 0.009), severe orthostatic intolerance (p = 0.027) and non-severe orthostatic intolerance patients (p = 0.042), compared with orthostatic tolerant patients, as shown in Fig. 1. Relative changes in systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure and cerebral oxygenation during mobilisation showed a non-significant declining trend in severe orthostatic intolerance patients (p ≥ 0.062), as shown in Table 1. Absolute HRV values in the standing position after morphine administration are presented in online Supporting Information Table S2. We observed an increased response in total autonomic power-i, low frequency-i and high frequency-i in orthostatic intolerance and non-severe orthostatic intolerance patients in standing position, compared with orthostatic tolerant patients (p ≤ 0.015). We found that postoperative treatment with opioids may be an important contributing factor to the development of postoperative orthostatic intolerance, independent of other peri-operative factors, such as inflammation, anaesthesia, hypovolaemia and pain. We found a high orthostatic intolerance incidence (38%) after pre-operative morphine administration, in line with previous studies investigating the effect of postoperative opioids on orthostatic intolerance [6, 7]. More importantly, 17% of patients could not complete the mobilisation procedure due to intolerable orthostatic intolerance symptoms. The impact of opioids on orthostatic intolerance is clinically relevant, as prolonged postoperative immobilisation likely increases the risk of postoperative complications and delayed discharge. Opioids favour parasympathetic, over sympathetic, dominance, resulting in cardiovascular depressant effects, bradycardia being the predominant effect. In line with this, we found impaired heart rate responses during mobilisation in orthostatic intolerance patients after morphine administration, as well as increased parasympathetic outflow (HF-i) using HRV analysis. We believe this is a novel and primary pathophysiological mechanism in orthostatic intolerance development, together with previously described postoperative vasoplegia [8]. Surprisingly, total autonomic power and sympathetic outflow (LF-i) were increased in the standing position in orthostatic intolerance patients, suggesting autonomic sympathetic compensation. However, sympathetic overactivation due to impending surgery might have confounded our measurements. In conclusion, morphine may be an important contributory factor to postoperative orthostatic intolerance. As opioid use is common in postoperative pain management, our findings highlight the necessity for further research looking at opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia.

The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances.

Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

      "abstract": "The other health impairment (OHI) disability category refers to a condition that causes limited strength, vitality, or alertness, including heightened alertness to environmental stimuli that results in limited alertness with respect to the educational environment due to a chronic or acute health problem and adversely affects a child's educational performance. This disability category, as explored in this chapter, may include one or a combined type of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, a heart condition, kidney disease, sickle cell anemia, and Tourette's syndrome. As a result of the child's other health impairment, as described above, the child is prevented from receiving reasonable educational benefit from general education.",

      "title": "Depression and anxiety: Distinguishing unipolar and bipolar disorders",
      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

Any chemical can become toxic if too much is taken in relation to body weight and physiologic capacity. ■ Substance misuse often leads to acute and chronic toxicity from a variety of medications, commercial products, and illicit agents. The management of acute toxicity from substance misuse typically follows the same general approaches as those for poisoning and overdose. A challenge faced in many acute drug overdoses is determining the agents taken and possible adulterants or contaminants. Chronic misuse can lead to dependence, tolerance, withdrawal, and addiction. ■ Substance use disorder is a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress within a 12-month period.

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "title": "Targeting Opioid and Neurokinin-1 Receptors to Treat Alcoholism",
      "abstract": "Alcoholism is a multifarious and ongoing disease tightly related to the amount of alcohol ingested, the drinking pattern, the history of alcohol drinking and the individual features, such as some genetic traits. Worldwide alcohol is the necessary cause of approximately 60 diseases and causes circa 2.5 million deaths every year. Studies show that alcohol interacts with brain neurotransmission in a complex manner. Dopaminergic, GABAergic, serotonergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic systems are all key participants in the action of ethanol on the brain. Furthermore, several neuropeptides, such as endogenous opioid peptides, substance P, corticotropin-releasing hormone, or the appetite-regulating peptides (eg., neuropeptide Y, ghrelin or orexin) also play a role in alcohol drinking. Treatment of alcohol use disorders (AUD) is based on the application of combined approaches, including pharmacological intervention directed to different molecular targets. Results, however, are variable, not always satisfactory, and not applicable to all stages and pathologies or to all patients. New strategies focused on the control of neuropeptide performance in the brain are being explored and may be an advance in the therapy of alcoholism. The application of treatments ad personam represents a challenge that currently stimulates research in different realms, including epidemiology, psychology, chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology and pharmacology. In this review the potential value and application of ligands that modulate the function of opioid and neurokinin-1 receptors in alcoholism therapy is analyzed.",

      "title": "Hypnosis as an Adjunct to Anesthesia in Children",
      "abstract": "Most children anticipate the prospect of submitting to surgery and anesthesia with fear and apprehension. Youngsters who have to be given an anesthetic are afraid that something disastrous may happen to them while they are asleep. The child fears not only what he can understand but also what is less understandable, such as will he ever wake up or is he going to be killed? There are many connections in the child's mind between anesthesia, sleep, and death.1 When a child is brought to the operating room heavily premedicated or asleep, without having his fears allayed or his anxieties resolved, he will usually experience a nightmare of restlessness on recovery. During such a confused and stressful state, a child is more subject to psychic trauma than one who will recover quickly and quietly to a state of full consciousness and awareness.2 Sleep disturbances, temper tantrums, hallucinatory phenomena, and dependency reactions have been reported after surgical procedures where anesthesia was administered.3 In order to cope with this situa¬ tion, anesthesiologists in recent years have become more aware and better oriented to the psychological aspects of anesthesia for children.4·5 It is but a short step in inducing anesthe¬ sia in children with the use of stories, music, and flavoring agents to the superior effec¬ tiveness of an hypnotic induction. With children, relaxation by means of hypnosis is worth while. The comparative ease of inducing hypnosis in many children is a surprising finding. More than half of them can reach a sufficient hypnotic depth to permit minor surgical procedures, such as venipuncture, spinal tap, and reduction of simple fractures, to be performed. Hypnosis is a valuable method of inducing anesthesia or achieving basal anesthesia in children.6·7 Hypnotic inductions permit the use of posthypnotic suggestions that render recovery from anesthesia less distressing and more pleasant. Results in such cases are gratifying, because on recovery these children are quieter, more comfortable, and more cooperative than those who undergo anesthesia induced by chemical agents alone. Although hypnosis may be performed suc¬ cessfully in younger children on occasion, youngsters between the ages of 7 and 14 years are the most susceptible. These chil¬ dren usually make good subjects because of their heightened powers of imagination and their ability to play a role or create a fantasy. I try to use the child's own experiences—things with which he is famil¬ iar, so that better imagery can be produced. If children are admitted the day prior to surgery, a visit may be made in the after¬ noon or evening in order to take advantage of the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the child and to ascertain his area of interests. If it is possible to have a pre¬ liminary rehearsal of the hypnotic induction, it will serve the anesthesiologist well. How¬ ever, no attempt should be made to force the situation. For children admitted in the early morning for surgery a few hours later",

Gastroesophageal reflux usually presents as recurrent vomiting in infants and young children. A small subgroup of infants develop apnea and cyanosis accompanied by posturing of the limbs, deviation of the eyes, or opisthotonos, which leads to the incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy. Breathholding spells and pallid infantile syncope, common in infants and young children, may also be mistaken for epileptic attacks. The parasomnias, including pavor nocturnus and somnambulism, are frequently mistaken for epilepsy, since these nocturnal episodes are paroxysmal in nature, may be associated with automatic behavioral mannerisms, and tend to be recurrent. Migraine is especially difficult to differentiate from epilepsy because its manifestations, particularly in children, are so diverse. Other disorders that may superficially mimic epilepsy include transient ischemic attacks, syncope, and transient global amnesia.",
