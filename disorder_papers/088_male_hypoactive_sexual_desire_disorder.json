      "title": "Sexualidade e doenças reumáticas",
      "abstract": "A atividade sexual satisfatória é um dos pilares da qualidade de vida, envolvendo das preliminares ao intercurso sexual, mecanismos neurológicos, vasculares, endocrinológicos, musculoesqueléticos, psicossociais, culturais, além do parceiro sexual e fatores individuais (autoestima, imagem corporal e habilidade pessoal). A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is an important unwanted phenomenon of psychotropic medications.This is often underreported and not given due importance, which can often lead to impaired quality of life and less-than-optimal medication compliance.All types of psychotropic medications are linked to sexual side effects.As the underlying mental disorder improves, some of the sexual issues abate, but treatment-related sexual adverse effects may persist over time and are unfortunately underrecognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials.When it comes to sexual dysfunction due to psychiatric disorders, there are two important things to understand.First, any mental illness can cause sexual dysfunction, and second, severer the underlying psychiatric disorder, severer is the sexual dysfunction (in both frequency and severity).Even though patients may be suffering from mental illnesses of variable severity, it is important for them to have a normal and enjoyable sex life.The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction found with antidepressant medication varies considerably between different studies, making it difficult to estimate the exact incidence or prevalence.The sexual problems encompass a range of sexual disorders and include decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, and erection or delayed ejaculation problems.Patients with sexual disorders usually also have anxiety disorder and vice versa; also, women with sexual dysfunction are more prone to anxiety and depression compared with others.This happens because sex steroids and the various neurotransmitters modulate both sexual function and mood.The mechanism by which psychotropic medications affect the sexual cycle is through the interaction between medications and the various abovementioned neurotransmitters.Physicians should monitor their patients for antidepressant-induced sexual adverse effects, as these may affect compliance with therapy and the ultimate treatment success.Sexual function should be actively assessed at regular intervals.Management of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction requires an individualized approach.",

      "abstract": "L’orgasmo ha importanti significati personali e relazionali. La disfunzione orgasmica puo essere primaria o secondaria, assoluta o relativa alla relazione con uno o con qualunque partner, e/o relativa ad una o a tutte le modalita di stimolazione e attivita sessuale. La diagnosi dovrebbe indagare i fattori che possono concorrere al disturbo orgasmico come fattori predisponenti, precipitanti e di mantenimento. Tra i fattori biologici vanno indagati: farmaci antidepressivi, ipotono o ipertono del pavimento\r\npelvico, incontinenza da urgenza, esiti inadeguati o dolorosi dell’episiotomia, inadeguata impregnazione estrogenica e androgenica genitale. Tra i fattori psicosessuali sono importanti la comorbilita con disturbi del desiderio e/o dell’eccitazione, la depressione, la qualita della confidenza erotica che la donna ha con il proprio corpo e la propria sensualita, pregressi abusi sessuali. Fattori relazionali includono la qualita della relazione di coppia ed eventuali problemi sessuali maschili, quali l’ejaculazione precoce o il deficit di erezione. Il lavoro presenta l’iter diagnostico anamnestico\r\ne obiettivo che il ginecologo puo utilizzare per definire la diagnosi e orientare in modo personalizzato l’approccio terapeutico.",

      "title": "The impact of severe mental disorders and psychotropic medications on sexual health and its implications for clinical management",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction often accompanies severe psychiatric illness and can be due to both the mental disorder itself and the use of psychotropic treatments. Many sexual symptoms resolve as the mental state improves, but treatment-related sexual adverse events tend to persist over time, and are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction adversely affects quality of life and may contribute to reduce treatment adherence. There are important differences between the various compounds in the incidence of adverse sexual effects, associated with differences in mechanisms of action. Antidepressants with a predominantly serotonergic activity, antipsychotics likely to induce hyperprolactinaemia, and mood stabilizers with hormonal effects are often linked to moderate or severe sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, delayed orgasm, anorgasmia, and sexual arousal difficulties. Severe mental disorders can interfere with sexual function and satisfaction, while patients wish to preserve a previously satisfactory sexual activity. In many patients, a lack of intimate relationships and chronic deterioration in mental and physical health can be accompanied by either a poor sexual life or a more frequent risky sexual behaviour than in the general population. Here we describe the influence of psychosis and antipsychotic medications, of depression and antidepressant drugs, and of bipolar disorder and mood stabilizers on sexual health, and the optimal management of patients with severe psychiatric illness and sexual dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "title": "The Expression of Intimacy and Sexuality in Persons With Dementia",
      "abstract": "Sexuality in dementia is infrequently addressed. Dementia is characterized by a progressive deterioration in all domains of functioning, including loss of sexual function. However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

Whenever possible, the temporal association or causal relationship between the symptoms should be assessed. The sexual, medical and psychosocial history is an essential element in the basic evaluation and should be obtained in all patients presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction. The essential components of sexual function assessment in the male should always include: erectile response (onset, duration, progression, severity of the problem, nocturnal/morning erections, self-stimulatory and visual erotic-induced erections), altered sexual desire, ejaculation, orgasm, sexually-related genital pain disorders, and partner sexual function, if available.",

Although depression itself, apart from medication, is generally believed to be associated with sexual dysfunction, the few existing studies report wide discrepancies with regard to frequency, gender, and quality of sexual dysfunction. Loss of libido is frequently and consistently associated with major depression. Moreover, sexual dysfunction secondary to depression or other factors is often mistaken for that caused by antidepressant medication. Although antidepressants have long been associated with sexual dysfunction, the precise nature and magnitude of sexual side effects have not been fully appreciated. This article will review the literature on sexual dysfunction associated with unmedicated depression and offer a guide for the clinician evaluating and treating depressed patients with sexual problems.",

When any or all of these factors are disrupted by a progressive dementia it is unsurprising that sexual ‘problems’ are identified. Most sexual behaviour ‘problems’ relate to expressions of normal sexuality complicated by changes in relationships, care needs and cognitive function, and complex ethical and legal considerations emerge. Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium. Evidence and approaches to assess and to manage sexual behaviour problems in dementia are discussed.",

The most common complaint is the absence of subjective sexual excitement or pleasure despite adequate physical arousal (eg, lubrication).

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

In women, the cycle of sexual response begins in the brain, where a memory, an image, a scent, music, or a fantasy acts as a trigger to prompt sexual arousal. Thus, the brain is really the key and starting place for treatment of sexual dysfunction. Decreased libido, altered arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, and dyspareunia are the four broad types of sexual dysfunction in women. Decreased libido, thought to be related to androgenic hormones, results in delayed or altered arousal, decreased vaginal lubrication and dilation, delayed or absent orgasm, and pain or dyspareunia, which can lead to an aversion to sexual experiences.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is considered as a great human value related to happiness and satisfaction, but unfortunately, when affecting mental disorders, they tend to be associated with second level human functions. Nevertheless, sexual dysfunction often accompanies psychiatric disorder, intensely influencing compliance, quality of life and human relationships. Sexuality could be influenced either by a mental disorder itself, difficulties to get and maintain couple relationships or by the use of psychotropic treatments. Treatment-related adverse events are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians, scarcely spontaneously communicated by patients, and rarely investigated in clinical trials. The most frequent psychotropic compounds that could deteriorate sexuality and quality of life include antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood regulators. There are important differences between them related to some variations in mechanisms of action including serotonin, dopamine and prolactin levels. Little is known about the relevance of sexuality and its dysfunctions in chronic and frequent mental and neurological disorders, such as psychosis, mood disorders, anxiety, phobias, eating disorders, alcohol or drug dependencies, epilepsy and childhood pathology. Poor sexual life, low satisfaction and more frequent risky sex behavior than in the general population are associated with severe mental diseases. There is a need for increasing research in this field, including epidemiological, psychological, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and genetic variables related to sexual life to get a better understanding of the implicated mechanisms. To increase the sensibility of clinicians, the identification and management of sexual disturbances after the onset of any mental disorder should be highlighted. This would avoid unnecessary suffering and deterioration of quality of life.",

These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness.

Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

It can manifest as a paranoid disorder, as a delusional symptom of psychiatric, neurological or other medical conditions, or as side effect of dopaminergic medication. Although its exact prevalence remains uncertain, it has been identified in 0.5-1.4% of psychiatry inpatients. Objectives To describe sexual dysfunctions associated with delusional jealousy and to explore strategies for addressing these dysfunction. Methods A non-systematic review of the literature available at PubMed was conducted using the keywords “Sexual Dysfunction” AND “Delusional Jealousy OR Othello Syndrome”. Results A number of factors, including sexual dysfunction, can trigger or exacerbate delusional jealousy. This is especially true for middle-aged men who have a history of alcohol consumption, neurological or personality disorders. Individuals with sexual dysfunction experience feelings of insecurity, projecting these concerns onto their partners and suspecting extramarital relationships. On the other hand, sexual dysfunctions such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Female Sexual Arousal and Orgasmic Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction and Ejaculation Disturbance may occur as consequence of Othello Syndrome. Multiple factors contribute to these dysfunctions, including increased testosterone and cortisol levels, chronic alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric conditions and antipsychotics. There are reports of increased sexual desire, especially in cases of dementia. Conclusions Although the evidence is limited and dated, it points to a bidirectional association between delusional jealousy and sexual dysfunction. Further studies are essential to determine the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunctions in Othello syndrome, and the causal relationship between them. Additionally, investigating gender differences is crucial, given the male-centric focus of existing studies. This research can contribute to clinical care by promoting the screening for sexual issues and their integration into delusional jealousy management. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Psychobiological Correlates of Delayed Ejaculation in Male Patients With Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The pathogenesis of delayed ejaculation (DE) is rather unknown, though the contribution of various psychological, marital, hormonal, and neurological factors has been advocated. In this study we systematically investigated the relative relevance of the aforementioned factors in 1632 men who were seeking medical help for sexual dysfunction. The severity of DE was classified according to Kaplan criteria. Mild and moderate forms of DE (MMDE) recognized different risk factors than the most severe ones (anejaculation or severe DE [ASDE]). ASDE was essentially coupled with the presence of neurological diseases or with the use of serotoninergic drugs. Serotoninergic drugs also significantly increase (by at least 10‐fold) the risk for MMDE, which, however, was also coupled with other relational factors (eg, partner's impaired climax, patient's hypoactive sexual desire [HSD]) or intrapsychic factors (eg, stress at work). At multiple regression analysis, some organic pathological conditions (such as psychiatric disorders and hypogonadism) were also associated with MMDE. In particular, hypogonadism retained significance for DE even after adjustment for HSD (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08 [1.11–3.89]; P &lt; .05), suggesting other effects of testosterone deficiency on the ejaculatory reflex besides reduced libido. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that multiple psychobiological determinants are associated with DE, a still obscure condition that substantially impairs psychosexual equilibrium of the couple.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal.

Il testosterone (T) e la prolattina (PRL) sono i piu importanti\r\nfattori ormonali implicati nel controllo del desiderio sessuale. In quest’articolo descriviamo come altri fattori psico-biologici, individuati attraverso l’utilizzo dell’intervista strutturata SIEDY, siano associati al DDSI in un campione di pazienti maschi che si rivolgono ad un ambulatorio andrologico riportando un disturbo della sessualita. Diversi fattori relazionali (riduzione della capacita orgasmica e libidica della partner come percepita dal paziente, presenza di malattie nella partner, relazioni prolungate e conflittuali) e stressogeni ambientali\r\n(soddisfazione sul lavoro e/o presenza di conflittualita familiare) sono risultati significativamente associati con il DDSI. Tra i fattori ormonali, una iperprolattinemia severa (>700 mU/l), sembra giocare un ruolo maggiore rispetto all’ipogonadismo (testosterone < 12 nM) sulla\r\npatogenesi del DDSI (RR= 7.5 [2.5-22.4] vs 1.5 [1.1-1.9], rispettivamente). La presenza di disturbi psichiatrici maggiori o l’utilizzo di farmaci con impatto potenzialmente negativo sulla funzione sessuale sono altri parametri associati al DDSI cosi come la presenza di sintomi\r\nd’ansia e depressivi. In conclusione, il DDSI e associato a diversi fattori organici, intrapsichici e relazionali che possono essere simultaneamente individuati attraverso l’utilizzo di SIEDY.",

Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

The sutudy has been on psychic impotence which accounts for the most part of clinical cases and on endocrine (androgen deficient) impotence which were found conciderable in frequency.(1) The author has defined impotence as the deficiency of one or two factors of sexual pattern, that is, sexual desire, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.(2) The author's causal classification of 130 cases he treated is as follows: -a) organic cause: -penile (malformation or disease) 1.5%: endocrine (pituitary, testicular, or adrenal deficiency) 21.5%: nervous (central or distal motility, or sensory nerve damage) 4.6%. b) functional cause: -psychic (psychological 8 cases, psychic 81 cases which is 62.3%) 68.5%. c) other causes (urological cause by the disease in the urethra, in the accessory sexual glands, or by operation or external injury, diabetes mellitus, chronic consumption, physiological defect) 3. 8%. It is notworthy that out of the urological out-patient the psychic cause accounts for more than 50%.(3) Various psychic causes inhibiting the male sexual pattern were the basic factors, as the authors calls, of psychic impotence and the classification of 89 cases he treated is as follows: -sexual organ inferiority 6 cases, new marital condition 23 cases, abnormal sexual behavior 16 cases, disease anxiety or fear of disease 24 cases, suppression from the wife 3 cases, fear of conception 1 case, subconscious homosexuality 1 case, neurosis sign 8 cases, and unknown 5 cases.(4) The classification by age groups of psychic impotence is as follows: -the young group below 30 years old 45 cases, the prime-of-life group between 30 to 40 years old 18 cases, the more elderly and old age group 26 cases.(5) The author found that there was a characteristic difference between the basic factor of the young-group psychic impotence and that of the elderly-and-old-age-groups psychic impotence. The formation process of psychic impotence was that it originated from the individual's unconscious fear, doubt, anxiety, inhibitory idea about his own sexual function.(6) The treatment of psychic impotence was conducted primarily by psychotherapy through the interview at a regular interval and secondarily by medical therapy as a kind of trigger to cure. This method was sufficient and the most suitable even for a urologist.(7) The author's therapeutic result was that, out of 19 cases of new-marital impotence which is typical of young-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 2 cases unsuccessful, and uncertain of result 7 cases: and that, out of 22 cases of elderly-and-old-age-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 5 cases improved, 7 cases uncertain.(8) Endocrine impotence he treated was 28 cases and the classification of factors were that 17 cases were counted for the upper-central-nervous disorder, out of which 13 cases eunuchoidism: testicular disorders were 11 cases, out of which 8 cases post-pubertal castration, and 3 cases testicular atrophy.(9) The characteristic features of sexual pattern in endocrine impotence were that sexual desire generally declined, erotic erection and reflexible erection were damaged to various degrees, ejaculation decreasing and orgasm weakened.(10) Sexual function of castrate could be maintened and kept under control by supplying him with androgen. The author made investigation on the most efficacious method for it.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common disorder in old age, affecting at least 10% of individuals over 65. In older people, the relationship between depression and impaired social functioning and quality of life is complex and ill defined. Despite well-tolerated and effective treatments, many depressed individuals are undiagnosed or under-treated. The impact of depression on the quality of life (QOL) and social functioning of older people can be considerable. Furthermore, impairment of social functioning, consequent on the social isolation and functional disability that goes hand-in-hand with ageing, may be a causative factor in old age depression. Once depression develops, it may result in further narrowing of social repertoire, compounding the problem. Notwithstanding some of the difficulties in measuring social functioning and quality of life, progress has been made in defining the extent of these problems in older depressed individuals. The impact treatment of depression has on these parameters is becoming increasingly recognised and evaluated in clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

      "title": "SP0046 What we need to consider in physician-patient communication on sexual problems in different rheumatic conditions",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Quality of life (QOL) is often reduced in patients with chronic diseases. Sexual activity and enjoyment constitute an important aspect of QOL. Sexuality is a neglected area of QOL in patients with rheumatic disease. Sexual problems among patients are common and often increase with disease duration. Both disease related factors and the psychological response to chronic disease can impair sexual functioning. General disease symptoms like pain, fatigue, disease activity, and impaired physical function contribute to reduced sexual activity in both genders. However, psychological factors like depression, anxiety, negative body image and low self-esteem play an important role. Sexual dysfunction can create frustration and distress, and if chronic increase anxiety and depression, and damage interpersonal relationships. Sexual health is rarely addressed by health professionals (HP), and it is as a rule not spontaneously reported by patients. HPs may feel awkward to intrude into the intimate sphere of a patient, and patients may feel ashamed of revealing their sexual dysfunction. A first step to improve the physician-patient communication in this area is to include sexuality in the curriculum of health professionals teaching how to address and evaluate sexual function. Assessment of sexual function by validated instruments includes both frequency of intercourse as well as sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction. In women vaginal lubrication and in men erectile function and ejaculation are part of the evaluation. Assessment of disease activity and comorbidities helps to detect physical components of sexual dysfunction. Barriers regarding communication on sexual activity should be identified and overcome. Assessment of sexual function may be assigned to a specially trained nurse, an occupational therapist or a psychologist of the interdisciplinary team. Referral to specialists in urology, gynaecology or sexual medicine may also help patients to get a better sex life. A major point for restoring sexual and reproductive health in patients of both genders is to achieve optimal disease control. <h3>Reference</h3> [1] Østensen M.

Women living with psychiatric illness, despite their frequent sexual difficulties, consider sexuality to be an important aspect of their quality of life. Antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, the neurobiology and symptoms of the illness, past trauma, difficulties in establishing relationships and stigmatization can all contribute to sexual dysfunction. Low sexual desire is strongly linked to depression. Lack of subjective arousal and pleasure are linked to trait anxiety: the sensations of physical sexual arousal may lead to fear rather than to pleasure. The most common type of sexual pain is 10 times more common in women with previous diagnoses of anxiety disorder. Clinicians often do not routinely inquire about their patients' sexual concerns, particularly in the context of psychotic illness but careful assessment, diagnosis and explanation of their situation is necessary and in keeping with patients' wishes. Evidence-based pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available but poorly researched in the context of psychotic illness.",

Patients with addictive disorders frequently experience sexual dysfunctions and chronic use of substances tends to adversely affect all stages of sexual response, in both male and female abusers. An important aspect in the management of sexual dysfunction is psychosocial intervention. In addictive disorders, sexual dysfunction is of high clinical relevance, as it often leads to treatment non adherence and sexual or marital disharmony. Instead of a disease-centred approach, a couple and relationship centred approach of management is desirable. A detailed history about the sexual dysfunction, the addictive disorder and enquiry into various psychosocial aspects is mandatory for adequate management of the same. Sexual therapy, behavioural techniques, systematic sensitization and desensitization are some of the techniques used in the management of sexual dysfunction in addictive disorders. The assessment and treatment need to be tailored depending upon the various psychosocial aspects of the individual.",

      "abstract": "In Brief Low or absent sexual desire is the most common sexual dysfunction in women, and its prevalence peaks during midlife. Its etiology is complex and may include biologic, psychologic, and social elements. Major risk factors for its development include poor health status, depression, certain medications, dissatisfaction with partner relationship, and history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or both. Diagnosis is based on criteria set by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) and requires that a woman experience personal distress. Clinical evaluation should include medical history, sexual history, and, sometimes, a physical examination. Laboratory data are of limited value, except when warranted by history or physical examination. Treatment options include nonpharmacologic interventions such as education, office-based counseling, and psychotherapy. Although there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved treatments for low desire, pharmacologic agents have been used off-label for this purpose. Bupropion is an antidepressant that has been shown to improve desire in some women with and without depression. Systemic estrogen therapy is not recommended in the absence of vasomotor symptoms and is not directly associated with desire. However, vaginal estrogen is useful in patients presenting with concomitant vaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that can be used as an alternative to vaginal estrogen. Exogenous testosterone has demonstrated efficacy in treating loss of desire in postmenopausal women. However, patients should be counseled that it is not FDA-approved for this purpose and there are limited published long-term safety data. Several agents for the treatment of low desire are currently in development. Gynecologists are in a unique position to address concerns about sexual desire in women. Low or absent sexual desire is the most common sexual dysfunction among women.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Multiple factors, such as general health of the patient, chronic illnesses, psychiatric/psychological disorders, and socio-cultural factors, alone or in combination can be attributed to the development of psychosexual dysfunctions. The symptoms of these disorders vary for each individual and differ with gender. These disorders may be categorized as sexual dysfunction, paraphilias, and gender identity disorders. Dermatologists are sometimes consulted for sexual dysfunctions in their routine practice by the patients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics because a majority of the patients believe that these problems are caused by dysfunctions in the sex organs, and because people are hesitant to go to sexuality clinics and psychiatrists for such problems. Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them. Dermatologists should understand basic sexual medicine and ask patients for sexual problems. They should be trained to manage such patients accordingly. In this review, we will be focusing on sexual dysfunctions, their etiopathogenesis, and management from a dermatologist's perspective.",

The majority of cases have an organic etiology, most commonly vascular disease that decreases blood flow into the penis. Regardless of the primary cause, erectile dysfunction can have a negative impact on self-esteem, quality of life and interpersonal relationships. The initial step in evaluation is a detailed medical and social history, including a review of medication use. Discussion with the patient's sexual partner may clarify exacerbating issues. The physical examination focuses on the cardiovascular, neurologic and urogenital systems. Laboratory tests are useful to screen for common etiologic factors and, when indicated, to identify hypogonadal syndromes. Appropriate evaluation of erectile dysfunction leads to accurate advice, management and referral of patients with erectile dysfunction.",

Dysfunction can occur in one or more areas of the normal sexual response cycle: desire, arousal, or orgasm. It can also be due to pain. Family physicians should routinely screen all men and women for sexual dysfunction, given its high prevalence and high correlation with other conditions. Risk factors include use of prescription drugs (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, diuretics, antihormonals), recreational drugs, alcohol, and/or nicotine; certain health and lifestyle issues; and many chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. Diagnosis is based on clinical features; therefore, a detailed sexual history and focused physical examination are critical. Laboratory testing, imaging, and management are tailored to the suspected condition. Although some therapies require referral, education of patients about the normal sexual response cycle, discontinuation or changing of drugs, screening for and management of comorbid conditions, and counseling and guidance about lifestyle changes or use of devices all can be addressed in the family medicine setting.",

      "title": "Eating disorders and sexual function",
      "abstract": "Women suffering from eating disorders, present considerable retardation and difficulties in their psychosexual development during adolescence. This leads to primary or secondary insufficiencies in their adult sexual life. The cause of these difficulties seems to be a series of biological, family and psychosocial factors. The majority of the research findings indicate that eating disorders have a negative impact on the patient's sexual function. The factors related to eating disorders symptomatology that influence sexuality are various and differ among each eating disorder diagnostic categories. Considering anorexia nervosa, it has been reported that women have negative attitudes to sexual issues and their body. Their sexual motivation increases when they engage in psychotherapy and their body weight is gradually restored. Starvation and its consequences on the human physiology and especially on the brain function seem to be the main factor that leads to reduced sexual desire and scarce sexual activity. Moreover, personality traits that are common in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa such as compulsivity and rigidity are also related with difficulties initiating and retaining romantic and sexual relationships. Usually patients suffering from anorexia nervosa report impaired sexual behavior and lack of interest to engage in a sexual relationship. Considering Bulimia Nervosa, impulsivity and difficulties in emotion regulation that are common features of the individuals that suffer from bulimia nervosa are also related to impulsive and sometimes self-harming sexual behaviors. Moreover women sufferers often report repulsion, anger and shame towards their body and weight, mainly due to the distorted perception that they are fat and ugly. It is interesting that a number of research findings indicate that although patients suffering from bulimia nervosa are more sexually active and have more sexual experiences than patients suffering from anorexia nervosa, both groups of patients report more often than general population a lack of satisfaction from their sexual experiences. Other factors that are common to eating disorders and sexual dysfunction are personality traits, negative body-image, adverse childhood experiences, negative family climate and especially early traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse. Furthermore, comorbidity of eating disorders with depression may have a negative impact on the patient's sexual function. The treatment and improvement of sexual behavior is quite problematic when the patient is also suffering from an eating disorder. Eating Disorder patients are often very reluctant to discuss their sexual life with the therapist and to engage in any kind of therapeutic intervention. Comorbidity with a number of other disorders makes psychotherapy even more difficult for those patients. Furthermore, a considerable percentage of Anorexia Nervosa patients do not have any kind of sexual activity, at least until nutrition and weight are restored.",

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual dysfunction in men may be related to multiple factors according to the type of sexual problems (e.g. low desire, erectile, or ejaculatory disturbances). Organic and psychological factors both contribute to the development of male sexual dysfunction. Among organic causes, endocrine disorders (the most important of which is hypogonadism) may contribute to the occurrence of male sexual dysfunction, but are much less frequent than other organic causes (i.e. vascular, neurological, and drug-induced). Clinical assessment (including a sexual history) is important for identifying patients with hormonal (e.g. testosterone deficiency) or other disorders (e.g. vascular or neurological) who may present with symptomatic sexual dysfunction. The aetiology(ies) underlying the sexual dysfunction will guide the most appropriate treatment in individual cases. Management of male sexual dysfunction may include psychological counselling, pharmacological therapy (e.g. PDE5Is), surgery, and testosterone replacement therapy in cases of well-documented hypogonadism. Despite the recent improvements due to the use of PDE5Is, in the management of erectile dysfunction remains largely unsatisfactory for a significant proportion of patients so there is still a major treatment gap and challenge ahead.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

Depression can deprive a person of the ability to experience many of life's pleasures. It not only affects the mind but also the body--often in unexpected ways. As a result, many men who have been diagnosed with depression find themselves suffering from another condition: ED. Sexual dysfunction is a big problem also in patients with chronic renal failure and seriously affects their quality of life. About 40% of men on dialysis suffer from ED. Many uremic patients have additional symptoms including reduction of libido and a decreased frequency of sexual intercourse. With the start of dialysis some of these symptoms may improve, without, however, returning to normal.",

      "title": "Quality of Life of Older Adults with Urinary Incontinence",
      "abstract": "Health-related quality of life is now recognized as an important patient outcome in response to a disease, treatment, or procedure. The term health-related quality of life (HRQL) refers to a multidimensional construct involving the individual's evaluation or judgment about subjective well-being and objective attributes of functioning. Although there are varying definitions of HRQL, a group of international experts agreed that the fundamental dimensions of HRQL are physical, mental/psychological, and social health, as well as global perceptions of function and well-being.1 Other dimensions of HRQL might also be important, depending on the purpose of an investigation and the specific health condition being studied. These dimensions include cognitive or neuropsychologic functioning, sexual functioning and intimacy, personal productivity, symptoms, pain, energy/vitality, sleep, and self-esteem. Urinary incontinence and its associated symptoms can have a significant impact on the HRQL of older adults. Evidence suggests that incontinence can affect HRQL in diverse and far-reaching ways and that there is considerable variability among individuals in their perceptions and responses to urinary symptoms.2 In addition, there are differences in HRQL impairment, depending on the type of incontinence, the age, and possibly the gender of the patient.2 Surprisingly, research has not consistently documented a strong relationship between incontinence severity (typically measured in the number of incontinent episodes or grams of fluid lost on a pad test) and HRQL impact. The explanation for the lack of a strong relationship between these two types of patient outcome measures is unclear. In this issue are two reports that examine aspects of the HRQL of community-dwelling older adults with urinary incontinence. The reports approach the topic from different perspectives and research methodologies, yet each report makes an important contribution that furthers our understanding related to the impact of incontinence on one or more domains of quality of life. Catherine DuBeau and her colleagues3 present descriptions of the impact of urge incontinence in the lives of older women and men obtained through qualitative research methodologies. The ultimate goal of their work is to develop a HRQL instrument that has strong validity for use in urge incontinent older patients. These authors compared patient-defined areas of impact obtained through focus group interviews with provider/expert areas of impact obtained from the literature and included in published condition-specific quality of life instruments. DuBeau et al. also examined the patients'descriptions to identify the possible role of patients'explanatory style as a mediator of the impact of incontinence on HRQL. DuBeau et al.'s study represents the second generation of instrument development work in research on the HRQL of incontinent patients. She and her colleagues are to be commended for their sound approach to the development of a new condition-specific HRQL instrument. Because HRQL is, by definition, the patient's own perspectives on his/her functioning and well-being, the use of focus group and content analysis methodologies is appropriate. As a next step in establishing content validity, the authors could either take the items identified in the focus groups back to the participants or take them to a new group of older adults with urge incontinence for further validation. Another critical step, one which is usually skipped in HRQL instrument development, would be to have the participants evaluate the importance of each of the specified items in relation to the other items. This would help identify whether each item should be weighted equally or given a different value in calculating subscale scores. See also p 683 and p 693 One limitation in DuBeau et al.'s study was the use of a nonrepresentative sample, i.e., the sample was all white and predominantly of high socioeconomic status. Cultural and economic differences could affect perceptions of the impact of incontinence in participants'lives. Despite this limitation, the results from this study emphasize the differences between the way experts and patients view HRQL and provide new information on the impact of urge incontinence on older adults. More than half of the items identified by DuBeau and her colleagues were not described previously, which may be related to the different conceptual orientations of researchers about what constitutes HRQL versus what factors influence it. For example, DuBeau and her colleagues include a domain on coping. In some theoretical perspectives, this might be considered a personal trait that is not a characteristic of HRQL, whereas in others it might be viewed as a mediating variable of HRQL.4 Also, specific items identified — such as the inevitability of incontinence, that incontinence is a psychological not a physical problem, the association of incontinence with women's biology, and fear of aging — reflect an individual's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs rather than HRQL. A significant finding in this study was the greater influence of urge incontinence on coping with embarrassment and the interruption of activities compared with the performance of activities, which is used typically in geriatric assessment models. A novel aspect of DuBeau et al.'s study was the examination of explanatory style, i.e., the habitual manner in which persons explain how and why uncontrollable adverse events such as illness occur to them, as a possible mediator of HRQL. Previous research suggests that explanatory style correlates with the range of responses of individuals to illnesses. It makes sense that explanatory style affects responses to incontinence. The authors'findings indicate an association between negative explanatory statements and HRQL items and suggest that there may be gender differences. However, the results on gender differences must be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of men in the sample. No consistent relationship was found between incontinence severity, as measured by the number of incontinent episodes on a voiding diary, and explanatory style. Theodore Johnson II and his colleagues5 conducted a secondary analysis from data collected in the 1990–1991 National Survey of Self Care and Aging to assess whether urinary incontinence and its severity were associated with the self-rating of poor health. The National Survey of Self-Care and Aging is a random sampling of geographic clusters of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in the contiguous United States. This study had a sample size of 3485, with oversampling of the oldest-old age group and men to enable subgroup analyses. Findings from Johnson et al.'s study confirm earlier research about the relationship between incontinence and health perceptions. This is an important milestone. Urinary incontinence was associated with poor self-rated health for white subjects who had no instrumental activities of daily living impairments even after controlling for age, activity of daily living status, and comorbid health conditions. The odds of rating one's health poor were doubled if the incontinence was mild to moderate and quadrupled if the incontinence was severe. Previous research examining the relationship between incontinence and self-rated health status has been criticized because of the failure to account adequately for frailty. Johnson et al.'s study did control carefully for functional status and comorbidity and found that urinary incontinence is associated with poor self-rated health independent of frailty. Although analyzed carefully and interpreted cautiously, this study has two main limitations. First, it was a post hoc comparison dependent on cross-sectional data collected in a larger study for a different purpose. Thus, as the authors pointed out, conclusions about causality are problematic. Prospective studies are needed. Second, the quantitative nature of the study, with fixed choice responses to a survey instrument, does not allow for the breadth of responses that might come from in-depth interviews of incontinent individuals, allowing better understanding of why they rated their health as poor. Was it because of the incontinence and its associated symptoms or consequences, or are there other unexplained factors that might have been missed? Future research should address the frame of reference used by incontinent adults in their self-ratings of health. Krause and Jay6 found that global ratings of health are interpreted in different ways by different people and that these ways may depend on race and, possibly, education. Understanding why persons rate health in a particular way may be helpful in determining appropriate interventions. Additional studies on the HRQL of incontinent older adults are greatly needed. There is much that we still need to learn about how age, gender, and lower urinary tract pathophysiology alter the impact of incontinence on HRQL, as well as the factors that influence HRQL. However, these studies should be based on a clear conceptualization of HRQL in which the determinants of quality of life are distinguished from the dimensions of quality of life. Wilson and Cleary7 have presented a useful model that helps categorize clinical variables and shows their relationships with measures of HRQL. In their model, various patient outcomes are linked with causal pathways to show how intervening variables mediate the effect on HRQL. Their model includes five levels of patient outcomes: biological and physiological factors, symptoms, functioning, general health perceptions, and quality of life. Characteristics of the individual (e.g., personality, motivation, values, preferences, and symptom amplification) and of the environment (e.g., psychological, social, and economic supports) influence the five levels in complex ways. In addition, nonmedical factors may directly influence an individual's rating of overall quality of life. Translating their model to incontinence research, the biological and physiological factors might include the underlying pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract, urodynamic variables, and pelvic support and pelvic muscle strength characteristics. Symptoms are the patient's perception of abnormal physical, emotional, or cognitive states and are influenced by demographic and cultural factors. Examples of these include lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency, frequency, nocturia, and incontinence. Functioning refers to the individual's ability to carry out his/her normal activities. General health perceptions would be the individual's self-rating of health status. Overall quality of life would be the individual's life satisfaction as a whole. In conclusion, the qualitative study by DuBeau and her colleagues and the survey analysis by Johnson and his associates complement each other, enriching our understanding of the way incontinence is interpreted and processed by patients. Further depth and refinement in our understanding of the impact of incontinence can lead to more focused and more effective interventions that will improve the HRQL of the millions of Americans who suffer from incontinence.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction can have a significant effect on quality of life, but is not reported or underdiagnosed. A review of the recent literature highlights the correlation between sexual dysfunction and poor quality of life in people with psychiatric comorbidities and explores several aspects that influence care, from patient follow-up to pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Sexual dysfunction (DS) has been shown to be predominant, but underdiagnosed and often untreated due to communication barriers between patients and physicians. The pharmacogenic and morphogenic causes of sexual problems are often difficult to differentiate. Psychiatric illness may increase the risk of DS, and DS may further aggravate psychiatric problems, suggesting a two-way relationship. Their effective treatment often involves a combination of elements of psychotherapy and behavioral therapies with pharmacotherapeutic interventions, if necessary. The persistence of sexual problems has a significant negative impact on patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment, but also on the patient's quality of life. Routine assessment of sexual function needs to be integrated into ongoing care to identify and address early problems. If sexual dysfunction is ignored, the psychiatric disorder can be maintained, the outcome of treatment can be compromised, and it can lead to non-compliance with treatment schedules.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "abstract": "The Sexology Outpatient Clinic of São João Hospital Center is specialized in the attendance of users with problems or dysfunctions related to sexuality, such as male sexual dysfunctions. 46 year old man, single, with late onset of sexual activity which relates with his fears (partner becoming pregnant and sexually transmitted diseases) and his markedly obsessive personality. He describes previous occasional or short-term relationships and premature ejaculation on his first sexual experiences. During a phase without relationships, he began to discover his sexuality through masturbation, which tended to occur very frequently. He reported to especially appreciate the instant that precedes ejaculation, which led him to constantly try to delay the moment of ejaculation. Finding himself in a stable relationship, he reports that he cannot ejaculate during intercourse, achieving it only through masturbation, despite he could obtain sexual pleasure and have a sustained erection. At this point, the couple decided to have sex therapy. Premature ejaculation is a psychosexual disturbance defined as a persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it to occur. The main option for treating premature ejaculation are behavioral therapies such as the stop-start technique. In this case, the patient used this technique autonomously, by the means of masturbation, to delay his ejaculation, leading him to the point of being unable to ejaculate during intercourse.",

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

It is considered that symptoms persisting for more than one year may lead to a decrease in quality of life. It is accepted that older men may be affected at different age by symptoms of CP/CPPS. Men under 50 years old are diagnosed frequently. It is characterized by pain and discomfort in the pelvis, symptoms of the lower urinary tract and a high incidence of depression. CP can evolve without symptoms or with only weakening of sexual function. It never heals spontaneously. The disease poses significant psychological and social problems for men of sexually active age. The diagnosis and treatment create many difficulties. CP/CPPS combines several different prostate diseases and syndromes that differ in their characteristics and methods of treatment. CP/CPPS requires multimodal therapeutic behavior. It is recommended for the individual therapy plans to be developed based on multimodal therapy. The treatment is complex and aims at influencing the infectious agent and inflammatory processes, improving the quality of life, reducing symptoms and complications. Depending on the clinical manifestation, antibiotic therapy, Alpha-blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, antidepressants, phytopreparations, standardized pollen extract, other drugs that improve local and general immunity and function, Botulinum toxin A (BTA), Injection of local anesthetic, neuropathic pain medications, Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and others are recommended. Non-pharmacological treatment includes lifestyle change, psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy, prostate massage, therapeutic exercise, myofascial release, manual therapy, diaphragmatic breathing, biofeedback, postural training, education and training for home exercise program, traditional Chinese medicine (acupuncture), balneotherapy, peloid therapy. Reformed physical factors are affordable and safe to administer and do not have the usual adverse events observed with pharmacological therapy. These include TENS, interferential and sinusoidal modulated currents, high frequency currents, microwave currents, magnetic field, extracorporeal shock-wave therapy, Light therapy-infrared and red radiation LASER therapy. Due to the lack of high quality, randomized clinical studies, the effects of the physical factors applied need further clinical studies to determine their effectiveness.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

Although individuals may present with a range of sexual problems, DSM-5 recognizes only three major categories of sexual dysfunction: interest/arousal, orgasm, and pain.

At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. There must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months, although the duration may be shortened with appropriate treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis.

The genetic risk for the disorder is not enough because approximately 60% of people with schizophrenia have no family history whatsoever. The environment unlike this factor demonstrates a higher weight. Classically they have divided into positive and negative symptoms. It must be remembered that not in all cases the same combination of symptoms occur as it is considered to schizophrenia as a heterogeneous disorder. The decrease in attention, memory or disturbances in executive functioning are also symptoms called cognitives, which can get to add to the traditional division of existing symptoms. These symptoms and signs should be continued for at least 6 months of persistence. To continue with the diagnosis, have to remember that persistence is the key to the process of psychological evaluation, and in this case that presents psychotic symptoms is recommended a regular contact with the patient.",

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

      "title": "Men's Health: Male Sexual Dysfunction.",
      "abstract": "Human sexual function is complex and multidimensional, with physiologic and psychological components. The common sexual dysfunctions in men have significant overlap. Low sexual desire in men includes a lack of interest in thinking about sex or in being sexual, alone or with a partner. Sexual health counseling often is helpful. Physicians should prescribe supplemental testosterone only if it is clearly indicated. (Sexual dysfunction is an off-label use of testosterone.) Supplementation is not beneficial for men with a normal total testosterone level. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the consistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain a penile erection sufficient for sexual satisfaction. The cause typically is multifactorial. The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are the first-line pharmacotherapies for most patients with ED. Their use is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates. Peyronie disease is an acquired penile abnormality that causes curvature or other deformities of the erect penis. Premature ejaculation is defined as a lack of ejaculatory control that is associated with distress. All pharmacotherapies for premature ejaculation are used off label. First-line treatment options include daily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, paroxetine), on-demand clomipramine, and topical penile anesthetics. Psychotherapeutic and physical therapies also have been shown to be effective.",

Diagnosis of mania requires that a patient’s work and social life be significantly affected, or that the patient needs hospitalisation. Diagnosis also requires the presence of three or more of the following symptoms: inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; decreased need for sleep; increased talkativeness; racing thoughts/ideas; distraction; increased goal-directed activity; excessive involvement in pleasurable activities [1].",

The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

Studies using retrospective self‐report of sexual attitude and behavior find an incidence of sexual dysfunction ranging from 14–66%. Sexual dysfunction may be more common in partial than in generalized epilepsies. Sexual dysfunction in epilepsy may result from a disturbance in social or psychological factors affecting sexual responsiveness. Alternatively, epileptiform discharges may disrupt the function of structures mediating sexual behavior, particularly the limbic cortex, or alter the release of hypothalamic or pituitary hormones. Antiepileptic drugs modulate hormone release from the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal axis and may have direct inhibitory effects on sexual behavior. Evidence both supports and refutes each of these etiologies in the sexual dysfunction seen with epilepsy. Specific evaluation and treatment protocols for patients with sexual dysfunction are available.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

Patients rarely consult their physician for abuse they suffered, and they often keep it a lifetime secret. Moreover, since there is a latency period between the abuse and the emergence of physical symptoms, neither the physician nor the patient realize how past abuse and present symptoms are related. Symptomatic treatment cannot treat the root pathologies and thus, psychosomatic illnesses most commonly become chronic.",

      "abstract": "The restrictions imposed upon sexual activity by neck, back and radicular pain syndromes are of serious concern to the patient. In recent years the subject of When, and even How is raised with increasing frequency, and the patient expects the physician to reply with appropriate answers. The reply must be tempered by the level of the patient's recovery, the evaluation of what other activities the patient can perform without pain or with minimal pain and the method to be used. Sexual activity may precipitate recurrent pain or aggravate existing pain in the same manner as lifting, pushing, pulling or any other physical activity, if performed too early or too vigorously in the course of recovery from neck, back or radicular pain syndromes. In dealing with the problem of recovery from painful musculoskeletal or neuromuscular states, timing is of the utmost importance. Unless a timetable is specifically outlined, recurrences are common, and the condition may become chronic. The inability of the patient to deal satisfactorily with the sexual aspect of his daily living may, in itself, lead to emotional tensions and guilt feelings which may delay or prevent recovery. There is need to handle this problem at every level of the involvement in order to achieve a desirable end result-namely, the absence of pain and its replacement with pleasure.",

Their clinical expression depends on the sex and age of the patient. The severity and incidence of sexual dysfunction are influenced by the treatment being used, the psychosocial adjustment of the individual, and certain aspects of epilepsy such as the age at onset, time to progression, location of the focus, the type of seizures and the degree of control the patient has over them. The therapeutic strategy is based on adjusting or modifying the antiepileptic therapy and then treating the sexual dysfunction and/or possible hormonal upsets.Sexuality is a fundamental human right and as a health provider, the physician must take this aspect of the disease into account when dealing with epileptic patients by attempting to detect and characterise the disorder. The patient must be informed of the possible effects of epilepsy and its treatment on sexual functioning, and also the therapeutic options the physician considers to be best suited to the patient's particular case. He or she should also be encouraged to play an active role in making decisions on the matter and it is necessary to carry out developmental monitoring that takes into account the impact that improved sexual functioning is going to have on the patient's psychosocial and family adjustment.",

      "title": "Compulsive Sexual Behaviors in a Young Male with Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behaviours are relatively rare and are not known to be associated with social phobias, with an intense scientific debate on going if it constitutes a behavioral addiction. Compulsive sexual behaviours otherwise known as Hypersexuality/problematic sexual behaviour and is identified by a persistent pattern of failure to control repetitive, intense urges, fantasies and behaviours of a sexual nature over an extended period of time that causes marked impairment in multiple areas of functioning, in this case, especially educational functioning. Phobic anxiety disorders also known as social phobias are a group of conditions in which anxiety is triggered typically in well-defined situations that are not currently dangerous with resulting avoidance of such situations. Nevertheless, CSB is not captured in DSM V and ICD10, although, diagnostic criteria were proposed during DSM V revision, it is not currently recognized in the DSMV. Although, CSB has been proposed for inclusion in ICD 11 as an impulse control disorder, rather than as a mental and behavioural disorder as previously debated, in addition, strict diagnostic guidelines were instituted due to concerns of over pathologizing sexual behaviours. This presents a diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the psychiatrist when a patient presents with symptoms of Compulsive sexual behaviours with or without anxiety, since there are presently no diagnostic and treatment guidelines. We present the case of a 23 year old 3rd year medical student with a 5 year history of compulsive masturbation, persistent pornography viewing, failure to resist impulses and fantasies with accompanying intense distress especially following periods of abstinence and a two year history of recurrent panic attacks in social settings in which women were triggers complicated by depressive symptoms, symptoms significantly impaired most areas of functioning particularly his academics.\r\n\r\n A diagnosis of Social Phobia/Social Anxiety disorder with episodic panic attacks and compulsive sexual behaviours and mild depressive episode was made because patient met criteria according to ICD 10 and proposed ICD 11. Mental state examination shows anxious mood, congruent with affect, depersonalization, derealization as well as anxious ruminations. Within a year, after commencement of an SSRI, Atenolol and Lisonopril and CBT all anxiety symptoms resolved with marked reduction in the frequency of pornography viewing as well as compulsive masturbation with associated fantasies. This case report lends voice to the on-going debate about the inclusion of compulsive sexual behaviours as a mental and behavioural disorder Dependence syndrome in diagnostic classification systems as well as the need for development of standardized appropriate treatment modalities. This case report will highlight Compulsive Sexual Behaviours, rationale for its inclusion as an addiction in classification systems and treatment approaches to the disorder.",

Tidak seperti tipe skizofrenia lainnya (hebefrenik, paranoid, dan katatonik), skizofrenia simpleks sulit ditemukan dan ditentukan diagnosisnya. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V menghapus diagnosis untuk skizofrenia simpleks, namun dalam Pedoman Penggolongan Diagnostik Gangguan Jiwa (PPDGJ) III dan International and Classification Diseases (ICD)-10 masih disertakan. Studi kasus ini membahas pasien yang didiagnosis skizofrenia simpleks dengan diagnosis pembandingnya episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik. Seorang laki-laki bernama AY, berusia 28 tahun, dan tidak tamat sekolah dasar tidak memiliki figur ayah. Klien AY pernah bekerja secara wajar serta menyukai lawan jenis. Kemunduran fungsi psikologis kemudian terjadi. Simtom negatif dari skizofrenia pada AY sangat menonjol, yaitu sedikit berbicara, afek datar, menarik diri dari pergaulan sosial, minat dan ambisi kurang, dan dorongan vitalitas rendah. AY memiliki ide atau pikiran-pikiran bahwa dirinya bersalah, berdosa, dan memandang sesuatu tampak kotor sehingga terdapat perilaku mencuci yang berulang-ulang.

Kata kunci: skizofrenia simpleks, simtom negatif, diagnosis, ego ABSTRACT Simple Schizophrenia is an unusual type of schizophrenia characterized by slow, progressive development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inability to meet community demands, and overall performance degradation. Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

      "abstract": "A number of patients with schizophrenia suffer from drug-related sexual and endocrine problems. Questionnaire\nstudies suggest that 40-60% of the patients report sexual dysfunctions. Sexual dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia\nseems to be associated with the disease itself, psychosocial factors, medical health, as well as to the use of\nantypsychotics. Many of the conventional or typical antipsychotics have been associated with sexual dysfunction,\nsuch as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmia, delayed or retrograde ejaculation, oligomenorrhoea, and\namenorrhoea. The contemporary literature hardly gives any information on systematic studies on the frequency and\nquality of sexual functioning in patients with schizophrenia. The limited information available suggests that some\nantipsychotics often induce sexual side effects and comparative studies are almost completely absent. The underlying\nmechanisms of sexual side effects induced by antipsychotics are only partly known. Several mechanisms contribute to\nthe effects of antipsychotics on sexual functioning. Dopamine seems to be involved in almost all aspects of sexual\nbehaviour and antipsychotics induced dopamine blockade playing a role in the impairment of all stages of sexual\nperformance. The prolactin elevation associated with dopamine blockade interferes with erection as well as with\nother aspects of sexual performance in a dose dependent manner. Also some antipsychotics induce noradrenergic\nblockade, which is associated with disturbances in ejaculation and possibly lubrication. In addition serotonergic,\nhistaminergic and hormonal effects contribute to the actual sexual performance. The aim of this paper is to depict the\nmechanisms underlying the sexual dysfunction associated with antipsychotic treatment.",

Among the leading causes of disability globally, BD is a major concern. Among all mental health illnesses, sexual dysfunction is underestimated and more common in the general population compared to those with mental health issues. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the sexual abnormalities and behaviors that are often seen in bipolar female patients. Final thoughts: Sexual dysfunctions and abnormal behaviors were more common in women with BD. Manic episodes are associated with increased hazardous sexual conduct in people with BD. Additionally, it was mentioned that couples' sexual pleasure is negatively impacted by hypersexuality during manic episodes and hyposexuality during depressed episodes, and this effect typically continues into the times between episodes. On the other hand, sex may be linked to negative emotions rather than diminished desire during depressed periods. Individuals with mental health illnesses have a greater chance of sexual difficulties damaging personal interactions and quality of life.",

      "title": "Chronic, Unipolar, Treatment-Resistant Mania: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "abstract": "Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women is defined as the persistent or recurrent absence of sexual thoughts or fantasies and/or lack of desire for sexual activity that is associated with marked personal distress and/or interpersonal difficulties, and cannot be better attributed to another primary disorder, medication, or general medical condition. Notably, HSDD shares some similarity with depression, as its etiology can be explained using a biopsychosocial model that includes biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors, as well as interpersonal influences. Due to its high prevalence and negative impact on the overall health and well-being of women, primary care health professionals and women's health practitioners need to be actively aware of HSDD, particularly because patients may be reluctant or unwilling to initiate a discussion about their sexual concerns during routine visits. HSDD is well established as a valid and treatable clinical entity. Even for those inexperienced in treating sexual problems, there are simple and validated screening tools such as the Decreased Sexual Desire Screener that can help identify HSDD and a need for further evaluation and treatment. There have been few established pharmacologic treatments for HSDD. Flibanserin was the first drug approved for the treatment of HSDD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Bremelanotide, a novel melanocortin receptor agonist, was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acquired, generalized HSDD in premenopausal women. Increased awareness and recognition of HSDD as a medical condition should provide an incentive for further clinical development of effective treatments for HSDD.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe, persistent fatigue which is not relieved by rest and is not associated to other medical conditions. Other common symptoms are including concentration and memory impairment, muscle and multiple joints pain, extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exertions, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms and depression, anxiety, mood swings and panic attacks. Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "abstract": "A disfunção erétil (DE) é a incapacidade recorrente de obter e manter uma ereção que permita atividade sexual satisfatória, sendo a disfunção sexual que mais afeta os homens no envelhecimento. Estima-se que 50% dos homens acima de 40 anos apresentem essa disfunção. Como a prevalência é expressiva, torna-se necessária a realização de uma revisão da literatura sobre epidemiologia, fisiopatologia e tratamento acerca da DE, com o intuito de melhor compreensão da doença. A ereção é dependente de vários fatores como o relaxamento do músculo liso do corpo cavernoso, o aumento do fluxo arterial e a restrição do fluxo venoso de saída. Esses mecanismos podem estar prejudicados em várias doenças, sendo que, em alguns casos, a DE pode ser considerada como marcador precoce de problemas mais graves. Essa disfunção sexual apresenta várias etiologias: vascular, endócrina, neurológica, psicológica/psiquiátrica e relacionada às drogas ou às intervenções cirúrgicas. O próprio tratamento de algumas doenças de base pode ser a causa ou o agravamento da DE, como alguns anti-hipertensivos e antidepressivos. A principal explicação para a DE é a redução da disponibilidade de óxido nítrico, um importante vasodilatador. Contudo, fazem também parte de sua fisiopatologia a obstrução mecânica dos vasos sanguíneos e problemas de transmissão de estímulos neurológicos. A DE é primeiramente avaliada pelo método clínico, mas existem instrumentos avaliativos multidimensionais, sendo o Índice Internacional de Função Erétil considerado o padrão-ouro. O tratamento pontual para esta doença deve ser fundado na sua etiologia. Existem várias linhas de tratamento, sendo os inibidores da fosfodiesterase-5 e a psicoterapia (para DE psicogênica ou mista) os de primeira escolha, associados ou não à reposição de testosterona. Como segunda-linha, tem-se a injeção intracavernosa de substâncias vasoativas. Caso essas terapias não produzam resultado, a prótese peniana pode ser indicada.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress.

      "title": "Questions in psychiatry (<scp>QuiP</scp>): Psychological basis for sexual dysfunction in psychiatry",
      "abstract": "This article is the fifth in our series on sexual wellbeing and its core components. Together, these brief papers aim to provide a foundation of knowledge, which clinicians can draw upon when assessing sexual functioning. The present article is the first to focus on factors that may negatively impact sexual wellbeing and contribute to sexual dysfunction. Specifically, it examines psychosocial factors, which, along with neurophysiological factors, that will be considered separately in a future QuiP, often contribute to sexual problems. We begin by outlining foundational principles regarding the psychological factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction in any individual, and then build on this with further information that pertains specifically to individuals with mental illness. It is important to note that whilst DSM lists a number of formal sexual disorders, these are not common in routine in clinical practice and not easily assessed. Instead, in clinical assessments involving mental health it is far more useful to describe any sexual dysfunction that causes significant distress in terms of the actual symptoms the person is experiencing (e.g., loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty achieving orgasm). In addition, it is critical to bear in mind that sexual experiences are inherently psychological and subject to the attachment of personal meaning. These then guide our expectations of what our sexual experiences should entail. Although we have mentioned the importance of assessing sexual wellbeing previously, it is important to note that sexual dysfunction is surprisingly common. Indeed, it verges on being the norm with an estimated 45% of all couples experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction at some time or another.1 The most common sexual dysfunction reported by females is low sexual desire (33.4%), followed by inhibited orgasm (24.1%), whereas in males the most common problem is premature ejaculation (28.5%) followed by performance anxiety (17%).2 However, it is also very common for most individuals experiencing sexual dysfunction to feel as though they are among a rare minority experiencing such difficulties. This is because even though the topic of sex seems to be ubiquitous, sexual problems or difficulties are seldom discussed, and may not be disclosed even within a medical context. When examining the psychological components that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, the cognitive-behavioural-emotional (CBE) model serves as a useful framework. This is often utilized in cognitive behavioural therapeutic settings to address various kinds of sexual dysfunction. The CBE model posits that psychological components comprise cognitive, behavioural and emotional domains, which when disrupted can contribute to sexual dysfunction (see Figure 1). These domains are further divided into sub-components that interact with one another and when disturbed can contribute to the development and maintenance of sexual dysfunction. Considering cognitive schemas, these play a significant role in sexual wellbeing, and when negative thinking takes hold, it can impair sexual functioning. For example, following a negative sexual experience (e.g., erectile dysfunction, inhibited orgasm, pain), it is possible to develop a 'negative expectancy', which in turn may lead to performance anxiety. If then, in this context, performance is again poor, this reinforces and further entrenches the initial negative cognitions. Other cognitive factors that can play a role include unrealistic standards for sexual experience, which is increasingly common because of widespread exposure to pornography, and 'spectatoring' wherein an individual self-consciously monitors and evaluates their experience rather than focusing on the sensation of the experience itself. Both of these factors can be addressed with psychoeducation. Typically, it is cognitive factors such as these that are amongst the primary factors that have triggered and maintained sexual dysfunction. For example, if a woman has an assumption that women should always orgasm during sex, but this then does not occur on a few occasions in her experiences, she may develop negative attributions regarding the cause, such as 'I am flawed, … something is wrong with me, … something is wrong with my relationship'. This can then lead to feelings of anxiety, frustration, embarrassment, and even shame. In addition, she may develop negative expectancies regarding sex, resulting in avoidance and withdrawal from sexual activities. Thus, a cycle is created and perpetuated, and this can result in what then seems to be a sustained loss of sexual interest, increased anxiety, and depression. The above example demonstrates how sexual dysfunction can be deconstructed into its psychological constituents and traced back to contributing factors, which can then be systematically addressed. The importance of sexual functioning in patients with psychiatric disorders has been discussed previously in this series, and more broadly is recognised as an important domain to assess for overall functioning. Thus, identifying potential psychological factors that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction is important, as it may provide an explanation for the problems the person is experiencing, and perhaps also identify an amenable target for interventions. In addition, as sexual functioning serves as a key indicator of overall functioning, especially in those with mental illnesses where it can serve as an indicator of recovery, addressing any psychological factors that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction is important. It should be noted at this juncture, that sexual dysfunction and the psychological and physiological factors that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, are all interconnected and thus there is a significant degree of overlap and co-occurrence between these components. Hence, our separation is purely pragmatic, and in practice, the two sets of factors should be considered jointly. For example, depression and anxiety often co-occur with physical health conditions such as obesity,4 and any one of a number of individual factors related to these conditions can cause, or be caused by, sexual dysfunction. In reality, a combination of factors is likely to have contributed to these problems and many of these will have a bidirectional causal relationship between sexual dysfunction and mental health. Thus, taking a holistic approach when assessing sexual functioning is critical. When assessing psychological factors that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, it is important to bear in mind that these factors are not necessarily and specifically related to sexual dysfunction per se, but that they can negatively impact functioning more generally. Thus, the psychological factors that need to be assessed during a routine psychiatric assessment remain largely the same. In addition, it is their potential impact on the domain of sexual functioning that needs to be given further consideration. Note, this is alongside their impact on other domains of functioning such as an individual's occupation, and relationships (discussed in previous Quip—'Assessing sexual dysfunction in clinical practice'). To exemplify the bidirectional relationship between sexual functioning and psychological factors, consider the observation that healthy sexual functioning usually alleviates stress, but that sexual dysfunction can also lead to psychological problems. Thus, many mental illnesses are associated with dysfunction across a variety of sexual domains. Further, once stress has produced sexual dysfunction, this can itself lead to further stress exacerbating the problems the individual is already experiencing. Trauma, is another significant psychological factor which is increasingly assessed in routine clinical practice. This encompasses various forms of childhood abuse and neglect (sexual, physical, and emotional) and traumatic events experienced in adulthood (see Figure 2). The impact of trauma on domains of functioning (education, occupation, social) is also often assessed in clinical practice; however, its impact on sexual functioning is seldom explored, if at all. It is therefore important to note that trauma can significantly compromise sexual functioning, regardless of the nature and timing of the trauma. In other words, the trauma does not necessarily have to be sexual in nature or have occurred during a critical developmental period for it to have an effect on sexual functioning in an individual. For example, sexual dysfunction is a known symptom in combat veterans with PTSD,5 and therefore, the contribution of trauma to sexual dysfunction should be considered broadly as possible and explored as a potential target for interventions. As pointed out earlier, mental illnesses impact a number of key psychological domains that can negatively impact sexual functioning. The most common mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, which often co-occur and occur alongside other disorders, entail a number of overlapping symptoms which negatively impact sexual functioning and wellbeing. For example, the symptoms of depression can be captured across 3 domains namely, activity, cognition, and emotion (for further detailed explanation, see The ACE Model*). In the domain of activity, the symptoms of fatigue, increased or decreased sleep and weight/appetite, can all impact sexual functioning due to a lack of energy, or impact self-esteem due to changes in weight that alter self-image and confidence. In the domain of cognition, impaired attention and concentration and psychomotor changes can interfere with sexual functioning by limiting mental engagement and preventing psychological arousal and stimulation. Finally, symptoms within the domain of emotion, such as anhedonia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness and depressed mood can all reduce or eliminate libido, which is essential for healthy sexual functioning. A common bedfellow of depression is anxiety, which when excessive can manifest as a disorder. Several symptoms of anxiety disorders overlap with those of depression, and therefore it is not surprising that anxiety can impair sexual functioning. As mentioned above, difficulties in concentration, disturbances in sleep and fatigue can all diminish sexual desire and the ability to engage in sexual behaviours and practices. Furthermore, generalized anxiety may extend to more specific anxiety regarding sexual functioning and performance, and can also cause erectile dysfunction, and anorgasmia in women. Aside from such specific psychiatric disorders, there are some general symptoms that occur in many mental illnesses and can have a significant impact on sexual functioning, regardless of diagnosis. For example, lowered self-esteem that stems from having a mental illness along with the stigma and shame that this may confer, can significantly threaten the integrity of one's sense of self. Understandably then, this can constrain the individual's ability to engage in sexual behaviours and practices even solo activities—especially if libido is also diminished or lost altogether. In this way, having a mental illness places an additional strain on romantic relationships and interferes with intimacy, all of which makes it difficult to form and sustain relationships. In this brief piece, the psychological factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction in any individual have been outlined, and then building on this, the additional psychological factors that occur within the context of psychiatric disorders have been explored. Importantly, many of these factors are already typically assessed in routine clinical practice, however their impact on sexual function is often overlooked. Furthermore, many of these psychological factors are not necessarily specific to any particular diagnosis, therefore it is important to bear these in mind in all patients. Finally, this relationship is bidirectional, and thus when assessing sexual dysfunction, it is equally important to examine its potential psychological sequelae.

The complexity of chronic pelvic pain can be challenging to treat, which can lead to frustration for both patients and their physicians. Treatment should involve a comprehensive and multi-modal approach involving psychosocial support, counseling, physical therapy, medication management, and interventional procedures. This manuscript will focus both on the etiologies and the interventional treatment options for chronic pelvic pain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infertility is a reproductive system condition defined by the failure to carry a clinical pregnancy following a period of 12 months or more of unprotected regular intercourse. Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Psychotropic-related sexual dysfunction is a quite frequent issue in clinical practice, mainly in chronic treatments affecting both quality of life and compliance. Recent findings In the last decade fortunately antidepressants and antipsychotic compounds have been deeply screened in order to identify sexual adverse events that were commonly underdiagnosed and previously underestimated by clinicians and perhaps by pharmaceutical companies as well. Some differences in the mechanism of action are the nucleus of this poorly tolerated adverse event. All antidepressants with serotonergic activity can cause mild to severe sexual dysfunction such as decreased libido and delayed orgasm frequently (>60%) or anorgasmia and arousal difficulties sometimes (30%). In contrast, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, or melatonergic antidepressants do not cause sexual dysfunction but perhaps the clinical profile of patients receiving these compounds could be different. Antipsychotics that highly increase prolactin levels and strongly block dopamine receptors could be related to sexual dysfunction as well. Unfortunately, these dysfunctions are present during the long term after the antipsychotic onset to provide continued symptom control and enable recovery. Young patients suffering psychosis and concomitant sexual dysfunction (erectile and/or orgasmic difficulties) tend to show poor compliance in chronic treatments affecting the outcomes. Summary The implications of psychotropic-related sexual dysfunction in clinical practice are relevant mainly in patients under long-term treatment with previous satisfactory sexual life. Implications for future research about sexual dysfunction in all new treatments should be strongly taken into account.",

Funktionelle gastrointestinale Störungen lassen sich durch eine angemessene organmedizinische Diagnostik und eine ausführliche Anamnese hinreichend verlässlich diagnostizieren. Die Rom-III-Klassifikation liefert eine umfangreiche Beschreibung funktioneller gastrointestinaler Störungen; in der psychosozialen Medizin wird die Diagnose einer somatoformen Störung vergeben. Patienten mit funktionellen gastrointestinalen Beschwerden haben ein erhöhtes Risiko für komorbide psychische Belastungen und Beeinträchtigungen. Patienten im psychosomatischen oder psychiatrischen Versorgungsbereich leiden ebenfalls häufig unter komorbiden funktionellen gastrointestinalen Syndromen. Führen medikamentöse Behandlungsversuche nicht zum Erfolg oder besteht eine psychische Komorbidität, sollte eine psychosomatische oder psychotherapeutische Behandlung initiiert werden. Ebenso kann eine psychopharmakologische Behandlung hilfreich sein. Die therapeutische Interaktion wird oft als anstrengend und frustrierend erlebt. Daher sollte die therapeutische Beziehung aktiv gestaltet werden; eine psychosoziale Perspektive kann schrittweise in die therapeutische Arbeit eingeführt werden.",

Depression and sexual dysfunction have long been known as comorbid conditions; however, some research suggests that depressed mood may not always be associated with specific sexual dysfunctions. Associations between sexual dysfunction and depression appears bidirectional, such that either one of these conditions may trigger or worsen the other, while improvement in one may also improve the other. This chapter examines the complex relationship between depression and male and female sexual dysfunctions. We explore the classification and prevalence of sexual dysfunction, the known interconnections involving neurobiology, and psychological issues. Finally, we summarize the core principles of evaluation and treatment of common sexual dysfunctions, particularly in the context of depressive illness.",

      "abstract": "The sexual dysfunctions are extremely common but are rarely recognized by primary care physicians. They represent inhibitions in the appetitive or psychophysiologic changes that characterize the complete adult sexual response and are classified into four major categories: (1) sexual desire disorders (hypoactive sexual desire, sexual aversion disorder), (2) sexual arousal disorders (female sexual arousal disorder, male erectile dysfunction), (3) orgasmic disorders (inhibited male or female orgasm, premature ejaculation), and (4) sexual pain disorders (dyspareunia, vaginismus).Articles about the sexual dysfunctions were obtained from a search of MEDLINE files from 1966 to the present using the categories as key words, along with the general key word \"sexual dysfunction.\" Additional articles came from the reference lists of dysfunction-specific reviews.Cause and pathogenesis span a continuum from organic to psychogenic and most often include a mosaic of factors. Organic factors include chronic illness, pregnancy, pharmacologic agents, endocrine alterations, and a host of other medical, surgical, and traumatic factors. Psychogenic factors include an array of individual factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, fear, frustration, guilt hypochondria, intrapsychic conflict), interpersonal and relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, relationship conflict, diminished trust, fear of intimacy, poor relationship models, family system conflict), psychosexual factors (e.g., negative learning and attitudes, performance anxiety, prior sexual trauma, restrictive religiosity, intellectual defenses), and sexual enactment factors (e.g., skill and knowledge deficits, unrealistic performance expectations). Understanding the cause and pathophysiology of sexual disorders will help primary care physicians diagnose these problems accurately and manage them effectively.",

As such, female patients should be asked routinely about a history of sexual assault, particularly if the patient reports relevant physical symptoms and/or substance abuse. Factors that could lead to children experiencing sexual assault (particularly via domestic minor sex trafficking) include a history of abuse, substance use, mental health issues, family dysfunction, and the involvement of Child Protective Services. Short-term goals of primary care include management of physical injuries and psychological needs, evaluation for pregnancy, and prevention of sexually transmitted infections.

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

Onset is insidious, idiopathic, and hastened by neurological incident or infection. Typically, the initial onset occurs during the teen years or after the second decade, although cases have been documented in early childhood, adulthood, and senescence. KLS is marked by unexpected debilitating, yet reversible, episodic hypersomnia, with varying recurrence rates; cognitive and behavioral impairment; compulsive eating; and feelings of derealization, hypersexuality, apathy, and depressed mood. Diagnosis is problematic due to the syndrome's rarity, disparity of presenting clinical symptoms, and misdiagnosis. Correct diagnosis can take up to 4 years. The clinical course is approximately 8 to 14 years from initial onset, yet may be longer in the adult form of the disorder. KLS has been shown to impact activities of daily living, usurping an adolescent of his/her social relations with peers, experiences, and time.

      "title": "Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Women: Physiology, Assessment, Diagnosis, and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Nearly half of women in the United States report problems with sexual function. Many health care providers do not ask about sexual concerns during routine clinical encounters because of personal discomfort, lack of familiarity with treatment, or the belief that they lack adequate time to address this complex issue. This may be especially true for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), the most commonly identified sexual problem among women. HSDD is characterized by a deficiency of sexual thoughts, feelings, or receptiveness to sexual stimulation that has been present for at least 6 months, causes personal distress, and is not due to another medical condition. This is an up‐to‐date overview of HSDD for clinicians, discussing its physiology, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. Although a definitive physiology of HSDD is still unknown, multiple hormones and neurotransmitters likely participate in a dual‐control model to balance excitation and inhibition of sexual desire. For assessment and diagnosis, validated screening tools are discussed, and the importance of a biopsychosocial assessment is emphasized, with guidance on how this can be implemented in clinical encounters. The 2 recently approved medications for HSDD, flibanserin and bremelanotide, are reviewed as well as off‐label treatments. Overall, HSDD represents a common yet likely underrecognized disorder that midwives and other health care providers who care for women across the life span are in a unique position to address.",

In recent years, the treatment of sexual dysfunction has shifted from mostly psychosocial interventions, such as sex therapy, to the use of recently developed biochemical interventions, such as the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. However, the increased focus on the medical treatment of erectile problems has been accompanied by a neglect of the biopsychosocial factors that affect the couple.

However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

A high percentage of patients with advanced cancer suffer debilitating fatigue that has a severe and profound impact on their lives. Fatigue may be caused or exacerbated by numerous factors, including the disease itself and its treatment, or multiple other interrelating symptoms such as dyspnoea, cachexia, anaemia and psychological distress. Continuous assessment of fatigue is a critical component of care for the patient with this debilitating symptom. Initial assessment should incorporate a detailed description of the patient’s fatigue history, its development, symptoms of the condition and any potential causes. Individualised management strategies that may include a combination of interventions can be administered to meet the specific needs of each patient. This article examines the nature of fatigue in advanced cancer, possible causes and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies. Conflicts of interest: none",

      "abstract": "The problem of drug abuse and addiction is one of the most complex problems that affects all countries worldwide, due to the serious damage it can cause to various health, psychological, social, economic and security aspects. All countries strive to fight it by any means necessary. The World Health Organization defines addiction as the compulsive desire to continue using or obtaining a substance by any means, with a tendency to increase the dose taken. This addiction causes psychological and physical dependence and a detrimental effect on both individuals and society. This complicates the treatment project process, especially if the patient/addict suffers from psychological and/or mental disorders associated with addiction. In particular, personality disorders have a direct impact on the behaviors, performance, functions and thinking patterns of the sufferer. As the latter adopts an unhealthy and rigid pattern that causes them and those around them to suffer several psychological, health, social, professional and relational problems... Relatedly, we decided to present a clinical case with a dual diagnosis, as this patient has been suffering from the consequences of addiction for many years accompanied by a personality disorder. As for the clinical symptoms that top the clinical board of the case, we find a complete aversion to his body as he has not looked in the mirror for nearly 30 years. The patient has lost the symbolic representation of his body as a physical reality through which it is located internally, externally and cognitively. This comes in addition to severe clinical suffering at the level of familial, social and professional relationships, which made him live in a state of permanent social isolation. In our therapeutic approach to the condition, we use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common type of psychotherapy in a regular manner, through a limited number of therapeutic sessions. The therapeutic intervention was carried out at the level of perception of incorrect or negative thinking, which enabled difficult situations to be presented more clearly and responded to in a more effective manner. Keywords: addiction, personality disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy.",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

Sexual dysfunction is a significant, but often underestimated, symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting 50–90% of men and 40–80% of women. The types of sexual dysfunction can be categorized in terms of the normal sexual response cycle: sexual interest/desire dysfunction (reduced libido), sexual arousal dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction) and ejaculatory and orgasmic dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction may not only be due to lesions affecting the neural pathways involved in physiological function (primary dysfunction), but also result from general physical disabilities (secondary dysfunction) or psychological and emotional issues (tertiary dysfunction). Comprehensive management should address all these possible contributing problems. Specific pharmacotherapy is only currently available for erectile dysfunction.

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients. The information is based on scholarly information supported by research and practical suggestions based on cumulative clinical experiences of the authors.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Age-related vascular changes have long been documented as an etiopathogenic factor of some geriatric depressive syndromes. More recently, it has emerged the concept of “Vascular Depression” recognizing that cardiovascular disease may predispose, precipitate or perpetuate late life depression. This condition was defined by an episode of major depressive disorder within the preceding 12 months in elderly with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease, or major cardiovascular risk factors. Vascular Depression isn`t described in DSM-V, and that difficults clinical recognition and affects clinically informed systematic studies. Objectives Regarding a clinical case, we enphasize the clinical impact of Vascular Depression`s hypothesis. Methods We present a qualitative review of this topic using the Pubmed Central database. Results 74 years old male patient, with major depressive disorder about ten years. Depressive and cognitive symptoms didn`t respond to antidepressive treatment and his functional state has gradually declined. Conclusions Vascular depression develops after the 60 – 65 years in the absence of personal and family history of affective disorder. The key symptoms are low energy, anhedonia, deficits in selfinitiation, psychomotor retardation, reduced processing speed and lack of insight into mood symptoms. Clinical assessment includes a review of history of vascular risk factors or/and disease, but also an imagiological evidence demonstrating subcortical white matter abnormalities. Insidious and chronic course tends to delay its recognition and management. This becomes critical because Vascular Depression is associated with poor response to antidepressant treatment and persistent depressive symptoms. It`s also associated with poor selfmanagement of comorbidities and impairment in daily function. Increased mortality from all causes is widely documented.",

In studies evaluating the possible role of depression in these associations, depression among sexually assaulted persons did not account for their poorer health. Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

Probably because of methodological difficulties inherent in assessing this complex phenomenon, even the most commonly assessed outcome variables have produced contradictory results, with the exception of leaving or desiring to leave the psychologically abusive relationship. Some of the significant findings require more corroboration due to the small number of studies addressing them. The relative role of physical abuse in relation to psychological abuse has yet to be disentangled. Mediator/moderator variables are likely extremely important for explaining why particular consequences do not consistently result from psychological aggression. Although the hypothesized consequences/outcomes seem appropriate for further study, the most significant contribution may lie in intensive investigation of long-term, enduring psychological abuse that produces major personality and affective shifts in the recipient.",

Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Drugs may have negative effects on male libido, erection, ejaculation and orgasm, as well as on fertility, and research on these effects is increasing. Libido may be decreased by drugs that block dopamine or testosterone, or that cause dysphoria. Erection may be decreased by drugs that divert blood flow from the penis, or drugs that affect spinal reflexes. Ganglion blockers may also inhibit erection. Ejaculation may be diminished by drugs that affect spinal reflexes or be inhibited by ganglion blockage. Enervation of the vas deferens and epididymis may be blocked and cause a smaller emission. Retrograde ejaculation may occur due to blockage of the internal urethral sphincter. Orgasm is usually inhibited by the drugs that inhibit ejaculation. Fertility is impaired by drugs that affect sexual performance or spermatogenesis. Major groups of drugs that may affect male sexual function include drugs of abuse, CNS depressants, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, psychotherapeutics, hormones, and cancer therapeutics, in addition to miscellaneous other agents. Information about these drugs has been arranged in tables so that the provider has a convenient reference to use when explaining to men the effect of drugs on sexual response and fertility.",

      "title": "Persistent sexual arousal syndrome and schizoaffective disorder: a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Persistent sexual arousal syndrome (PSAS) is characterized by unwanted and distressing genital sensations that persist for long time periods without concurrent sexual desire or fantasies. The aetiology of this remains largely enigmatic although it is likely that the condition has a diverse set of neurological, vascular, pharmacological, and psychological precipitants. Objectives To analyze the case of a woman with schizoaffective disorder (severe depressive decompensation) and a comorbid PSAS. Methods We study the clinical case of a 47-year-old patient who was admitted to the acute care unit due to a major depressive condition with psychotic symptoms in the context of a schizoaffective disorder after partial abandonment and erratic taking of the medication she was previously taking. Before the admission, the patient was hypomimic, perplexed, with psychomotor inhibition, bradypsychia, thought blockages, sadness, emotional lability, apathy, anhedonia, paranoidism, phenomena of reading and thought control, self-referentiality, delusional ideas of harm and auditory pseudohallucinations in the form of voices that urge her to harm herself. In addition, the patient presented several “sexual” crises that appeared paroxysmal throughout the day, consisting of episodes of sexual hyperarousal in the absence of desire, experienced with intense guilt. Initially, a differential diagnosis was made through an extensive history and organic screening, and she was finally diagnosed with a comorbid PSAS. Results Complementary tests (complete blood, urine and imaging tests) were normal. At the pharmacological level, several strategies were used that were ineffective: paliperidone up to 18mg/day that had to be withdrawn due to intolerable extrapyramidal effects, olanzapine up to 15mg/day with high sleepiness and finally caripracin up to 12mg/day with good tolerance and efficacy. Stabilizing treatment (valproic acid 1000mg/day with optimal blood levels (99.3 microgr/mL)) were added. However, after a month and a half of admission and given the little improvement of the depressive symptoms, even having added an SSRI for 2 weeks at full doses, it was decided together with the patient and her family to start Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)sessions. The patient received 12 sessions of bitemporal ECT with onset of response from the 6th session, with a complete remission of the sexual crisis and depressive symptoms. Conclusions To our knowledge, Yero et al., reported the first two cases of patients with concomitant PSAS and bipolar disorder treated with ECT. It is important to understand how sexual symptoms differ in PSAS and bipolar disorder. Remission of the mood episode could have been accompanied by resolution of the sexual symptoms. Although ECT was successful, the mechanism of action in treating PSAS is unknown, and it is premature to suggest that it should be recommended as a first line treatment of PSAS.

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia.

Most antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs have adverse sexual effects but it is difficult to identify if the impairment of the sexual function can be attributed to clinical picture or to the psychopharmacological treatments. Both antidepressants and novel and conventional antipsychotics are associated with significant sexual side effects and the presence of sexual side effects may affect compliance and adherence to treatment. In some specific clinical populations (e.g. youths), these specific side-effects turn out to be one of the most annoying and promote increased drop-out rates and poor adherence to treatment. Nevertheless, these clinical variables are often underestimated or not investigated in the course of follow-up of persons suffering from psychiatric disorders in treatment with psychotropic medications. Growing awareness of the adverse effects of psychotropic drugs has led to attempts to use adjuvants or substitute treatments to resolve sexual dysfunction. Effects on sexual function should be carefully diagnosed and treated; it should clearly discuss with patients in order to preserve an adequate quality of life, promote greater adherence to treatment and promote a good remission and recovery. The aim of this study is to review the most recent and significant literature data regarding association between sexual dysfunction and psychotropic medications, especially highlighting neurobiological and clinical data in order to improve the clinical pratice.",

Frequent diseases most commonly encountered in elderly patients--i.e. diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, depression, etc--represent a frequent cause of erectile dysfunction (ED) and are treated with medications that can interfere with sexual functioning at the central and/or peripheral level. Antidepressants, including the tricyclics and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, have been implicated in ED, decreased libido, and impaired ejaculation. Most antihypertensives have been associated with some erectile impairment, but diuretics seem to have little effect on erectile function. The calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors are associated with a low incidence of ED. Sympatholytic antihypertensives seldom cause importence but can cause retrograde ejaculation because of the relaxation of the smooth muscles in the prostatic urethra and bladder neck. The most commonly prescription drugs that can affect sexual function are briefly discussed and an integrated pharmacological approach to the patient with drug-induced ED is proposed.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "abstract": "Approximately 80–90% of women experience some symptoms in the premenstrual period at some point in their reproductive years. Teenagers often present with moderate to severe symptoms, while women in the fourth decade of life appear to have worse symptoms with the severity of the disease worsening with increasing age up until menopause. Obesity and smoking have also been identified as risk factors. Symptoms could be physical, psychological, emotional, environmental and/or behavioral and affect the ability to perform normal daily activities as well as adversely affect interpersonal relationships. Though several theories have been propounded, the exact cause of premenstrual syndrome is unknown. Management of this disorder requires a multi-disciplinary approach involving the general practitioner, the general gynecologist or a gynecologist with a special interest in PMS, a mental health professional (psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or counselor), physiotherapist and dietician.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nHuman sexual function is complex and affected by many different factors. In patients with mental and emotional disorders such as schizophrenia, biological and psychosocial factors associated with sexual functioning are further complicated by illness and medication effects. Antipsychotic medication, the main modality of treatment in schizophrenia, is known to produce sexual side effects in addition to others such as weight gain and the metabolic syndrome. Because of the sensitive nature of the problem, many patients may not report this side effect to the therapist, though distressing to them, unless specifically asked for it. These sexual side-effects may subsequently lead to nonadherence, distress in patient and /or partner and marital dysharmony. Therefore effective management of this problem is essential. While prevention is most desirable, early identification and effective management of these sexual side effects could improve compliance and quality of life.\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nTo study the nature, prevalence and risk factors for sexual dysfunction in neuroleptic-naive women with psychosis, and to evaluate the incidence of antipsychotic induced sexual dysfunction in these individuals.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nConsecutive antipsychotic drug naive women with schizophrenia or acute psychosis who met eligibility criteria were rated on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for symptom severity and the Female Sexual Function Index for sexual functioning. Weight, blood sugar and prolactin levels were measured. Socio-demographic details were recorded. After six weeks and six months of treatment with antipsychotic medication, the assessments were repeated. Using SPSS for Windows (version 16.0.1), mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical data. Pearson’s correlation and chi square were calculated to assess relationships between continuous and categorical variables respectively.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 104 subjects recruited, prevalence rates of sexual dysfunction were 67.3, 82.8 and 72.22% at baseline, six weeks and six months respectively. Incidence of sexual dysfunction at six weeks was 60%. The most common type of dysfunction was hypoactive sexual desire and orgasmic disorder. Factors associated with sexual dysfunction at different points of time included age, education, age of onset and duration of illness, negative and general psychopathology scores and type of antipsychotic used. Weight, prolactin level and dose of antipsychotic medication were not significantly associated with sexual dysfunction.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "Psychosocial therapies in addictive disorders",
      "abstract": "Substance use disorders form a significant part of global disease burden. With the increasing trend of use of psychoactive substances, the detrimental effects associated with it also increases. Individuals with substance use disorders are heterogeneous with respect to a number of clinically important features and domains of functioning. The pathophysiology of these addictive disorders is complex, not always linear and can be described as a complex bio-psycho-social process, coordinated by the neurological, vascular and endocrine systems. Apart from these biological factors psychological, physiological, environmental, and cultural factors are also invariably associated with use of a particular substance, and may have an independent intervening effect on the patient's overall quality of life and long term outcomes. Care of individuals with substance use disorders includes conducting a complete assessment, treating intoxication and withdrawal syndromes when necessary, addressing co-occurring psychiatric and general medical conditions, the achievement of abstinence or reduction in the use and effects of the substance, reduction in the frequency and severity of relapse to substance use, and improvement in psychological and social functioning, developing and implementing an overall treatment plan. Methods of intervention for achieving the above objectives vary from pharmacological to behavioral or psychosocial and from singular specific therapies to a broad array of services within a program. The role of psychosocial interventions has been especially underutilized and under studied in this patient population. Treatment services have been developed to address not only the substance use, but also the range of other problems that often predate, co-occur with, and are caused by these substance use disorders. These issues can include family or social relationships, legal matters, job or vocational concerns, medical conditions, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Identifying the magnitude of these problems and managing them effectively may have a significant impact on the prevention of relapse. The importance of developing best practices and clinical guidelines in this area is therefore essential. The essential concepts underlying the management of addiction and related disorders are adoption of a patient-centered framework for evaluation and treatment. As in other areas of health-care, increasing attention is now being focused on providing evidence-based care for persons with substance use disorders and in this context there has been significant progress in the development and standardization of psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders. Psychosocial treatments are now considered essential components to any comprehensive substance use disorder treatment program. Principles of evidence-based medicine may be followed in both men and women in diagnostic and treatment planning and adoption of common psychosocial management approaches for these disorders. They can be implemented individually or in groups and delivered by a range of health workers. Psychosocial treatments are considered to be the foundation of drug and alcohol treatment, especially for substances where pharmacological treatments have not been sufficiently evaluated. The highlights of this book includes a comprehensive overview of the various psychosocial assessment tools, intervention strategies, the efficacy of a community based approach as well as the use of innovative approaches such as digital technology in formulating an adequate psychosocial management approach. There is a need for research on psychological interventions in special populations such as adolescents, the geriatric population, poly drug misuser, those with medical comorbidities, people with psychiatric comorbidity and other specific groups like LGBT, the tribal population and those with physical impairments. The recent literature regarding the same has been highlighted in this book. Maintaining the ethical frame is paramount in the therapy room and this extends to any intervention research which involves human participants. The chapter on ethics examines the debates and recommendations concerning key ethical issues in research on psychotherapy and various psychosocial interventions. Healthy family interaction and regular treatment follow up with support of family has proved to be the major protective factors of abstinence after treatment. These family based interventions would promote the quality of social support to the individual and it has been documented that social support when supplemented with effective community based interventions is a crucial factor in recovery. These guidelines outline this very model and addresses the importance of training primary health care doctors, NGO staff, volunteers, counselors, college & school teachers, strengthening self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) in case identification, diagnosis, referral to treatment, providing long term care and rehabilitation services of patients with addiction disorders.. We hope that these guidelines would help in facilitating proper management of patients presenting with various types of substance use disorders and that the information provided will be of interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare professionals.",

One of the first diagnostic considerations must be the establishment of primary or secondary libidinal dificit, or indeed, whether there is no libido at all. In cases of libido disorders with primary libido dificit, depression, organic disease, or side effects of pharmaca may be the cause. Libido disorders in the presence of functional libido, however, must be regarded as primarily psychologically caused. An exception are libido problems in the presence of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vasculatory defeciencies. In these cases libido is either totally absent or appears only secondarily. The symptomatology of libido disorders in the presence of depression, diabetes melitus, and peripheral vasculatory disturbancies, as well as psychologically caused erectile and ejaculatory difficulties are discussed in detail.

According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

However, no evidence exists that psychological symptoms are directly related to hormonal changes during the climacteric. Psychological and social factors not specifically related to the climacteric appear to be an important predictor of psychological complaints during this period. Menopause has for long been regarded as a deficiency disease, requiring medical attention and hormone replacement therapy. However, it may be concluded that oestrogen is only a specific treatment for hot flushes and dyspareunia, but has no clear role in the management of psychological symptoms in menopausal women. A multifactorial approach, paying attention simultaneously to biological, psychological and social factors supposed to influence complaints during the climacteric may be more appropriate. A description of an integration of medical and cognitive‐behavioural treatment procedures in case of climacteric symptoms is given.",

To establish an accurate composite diagnosis, the urologist must be familiar with the many emotional and organic factors influencing sexual function. Research being carried on at various centers involves efforts toward better differentiation, or linkage, of psychogenic and organic impotence. The author has previously reported acceptable rates of successful therapy of psychogenic impotency in men. The technique consists essentially of attentive listening and emotional support. Treatment usually can be accomplished within three sessions at weekly intervals–a much shorter time than that involved in other current methods. Psychogenic impotency may be treated primarily by the urologist, or he may refer the patient to an appropriate consultant. Not all patients require or will respond to the same therapeutic approach.",

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "title": "Estrés diario y calidad de vida en las personas con lesión medular espinal",
      "abstract": "La Lesion Medular Espinal (LME) refiere a un suceso vital mayor que provoca importantes y permanentes cambios. Consiste en un cese de la senal neuronal que oca-siona una restriccion de las funciones motoras, sensitivas y vegetativas por debajo de la lesion. Una LME afecta gravemente a las funciones y capacidades de la persona. El estres diario puede entenderse como de¬mandas coti¬dianas y frus¬trantes que condicionan la interac¬cion del sujeto con el medio. Se ha encontrado que un aumento en la percepcion de contrariedades predice un empeoramiento de la sintomatologia psicologica y somatica. Las personas con una LME se en¬frentan a un amplio conjunto de situa¬ciones estresantes novedo¬sas. La calidad de vida (CV) es un constructo complejo y aun no se ha alcanzado un acuerdo general en su definicion. Puede interpretarse como un estilo personal cuyas caracteristicas serian encontrar un equilibrio entre expectativas, esperanzas y realida-des conseguidas o asequibles. Los objetivos principales de esta tesis fueron el desarrollo y validacion de una es-cala de me¬dida del estres diario en la LME, por un lado, y la medida y valoracion de la CV en la poblacion de lesionados medulares, asi como por que variables resulta mas influenciada, por otro. Para cubrir el primer objetivo, desarrollamos la Escala de Estres Diario para la Lesion Medular Espinal (EED–LME–26). Resulta importante puesto que en la actuali-dad no existe ninguna herra¬mienta para este proposito en esta poblacion. Para su crea-cion se utilizo una muestra de 105 sujetos. Se realizo un analisis factorial exploratorio obteniendose 9 dimensiones del estres. Posteriormente, aplicando analisis factorial confirmatorio validamos 8 de las 9 dimensiones anteriores. La validez concurrente de la escala se com¬probo a traves de correla¬ciones con otras medidas del estres psicoso-cial, mostrando que nuestra escala es adecuada para la evaluacion del estres diario en la LME. Para estimar la CV en la LME, se valoro el impacto de diversos indicadores obje-tivos, variables sociodemograficas, y psicosociales asi como la relacion de CV con la salud subjetiva. A tal fin, se llevo a cabo un analisis de regresion multiple hacia ade-lante. Su resultado mostro que la CV en los participantes de nuestra muestra se asocia negativamente con la gravedad de la LME, con una peor salud fisica, y con un incre-mento en la variable “consumo de analgesicos”. Y hubo una correlacion positiva con un nivel alto de hardiness, apoyo social, y vivienda adaptada. Consideramos que la EED–LME–26 sera un instru¬mento que pueda utilizarse en investigacio¬nes sobre la influencia del estres diario en lesionados medulares. Tambien podra servir al personal sani¬tario, psicolo¬gico y psiquia¬trico de cara a obtener infor-macion util y rele¬vante para la terapia con la LME y tratar trastornos psicologicos colaterales a la LME. En relacion con nuestro estudio de la CV en personas con una LME, se han proporcionado datos de interes tanto desde una perspectiva orientada a la salud, como, tambien, para colaborar con las distintas asociaciones de lesionados medulares y dis-capacitados, de manera que estas puedan emplearlos como un instrumento de sensibi-lizacion de los organismos oficiales. Adicionalmente, tanto la EED–LME–26 como las conclusiones derivadas de nuestra evaluacion de la CV en personas con una LME, podran resultar utiles de cara a actuar en lesionados medulares que no logran adaptarse a su nuevo entorno, que han perdido su trabajo y el panorama laboral no es propicio. Asimismo, resulta importante para establecer una optima relacion social y/o familiar. Logicamente tambien es im-portante que la sociedad asimile a los lesionados medulares como personas validas y capacitadas.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are defined as syndromes characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation or behavior, which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. These are often associated with suffering or disabilities. It is known that one of the striking characteristics of certain disorders is related to their chronicity, which reduces the possibility of a cure and raises the discussion about controlling their symptoms to maintain the quality of life of individuals who suffer from them. A little associated but relevant intervention, if the state of chronic users in mental health is analyzed, is palliative care and its palliative actions that do not seek a cure, but to offer the maximum possible comfort to the user from diagnosis until their last day of life. Objective: Gather and analyze information regarding palliative psychiatry and its benefits for patients with mental disorders. Methodology: Articles published in indexed journals in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO), National Library of Medicine/NLM (MEDLINE), and National Library of Medicine/NLM (PUBMED) databases were evaluated, in addition to official sites such as the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the World Health Organization, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Results and Discussion: After completing the data collection phase, 33 relevant articles were identified for analysis of the proposed theme. It has been noted that palliative psychiatry encompasses a wide range of issues, including widely known mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, severe mental illnesses refractory to treatment, neuropalliative care, and symptom burden at various levels. Furthermore, it addresses ethical and psychosocial problems, psychological suffering, personality, desire and desire to die, dignity, loneliness, social isolation, as well as psychopharmacology. And that this care would be advantageous and of fundamental importance to patients with serious mental illnesses. Conclusion: Given the new perspectives for mental health care in an increasingly humanized way, the articles highlighted the benefits of palliative psychiatry and its importance in improving the quality of life of patients with serious mental disorders. However, it was also observed that many barriers need to be overcome to guarantee quality care for the group in question.",

      "abstract": "All humans will undergo aging, which has significant impacts both physically and mentally. Anxiety disorders are psychiatric disorders commonly encountered in the elderly and correlate with increased health burden, morbidity, mortality, and poor quality of life. The elderly with cardiovascular and multimorbid diseases are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety disorders. This disorder can be a continuation of previous occurrences or a first-time event. The interaction between neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors triggers the onset of this disorder. Diagnosis enforcement is often challenging due to comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression or cognitive disorders, as well as the similarity of anxiety symptoms to symptoms caused by other medical conditions or aging. The elderly find it difficult to accurately describe and identify anxiety. Expertise is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, this disorder often does not receive proper treatment, even though optimal management is crucial to improving outcomes and achieving optimal quality of life in the elderly. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches require special attention due to the impact of aging on organ function.

Adanya interaksi antara faktor neurobiologi, psikologis dan lingkungan memicu timbulnya gangguan ini. Penegakan diagnosis seringkali menantang, karena berkomorbid dengan gangguan psikiatri lainnya seperti depresi atau gangguan kongnitif, serta adanya kemiripin gejala cemas dengan gejala akibat kondisi medis lain, atau akibat penuaan. Lansia sulit untuk mendeskripsikan dan mengidentifikasi cemas secara akurat. Perlu keahlian dalam menegakan diagnosis yang akurat. Sayangnya, gangguan ini sering kali belum mendapatkan penanganan yang baik, padahal tatalaksana optimal penting untuk meningkatkan luaran dan mencapai kualitas hidup yang optimal pada lansia. Pendekatan farmakoterapi membutuhkan perhatian khusus sebagai dampak penuaan pada fungsi organ tubuh.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a common consequence of medical illness and should be considered in any medical patient undergoing a psychological assessment. The common sexual problem areas are: desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain. Taking a sexual history is a sensitive task. The clinician must make an objective assessment of sexual behaviour, while taking account of the emotional issues and personal values that the patient brings to the interview. Great care is needed here as patients may discuss such experiences for the first time and such disclosures arouse considerable emotion. Useful tests to investigate underlying problems are available. The phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil has revolutionized treatment of men with erectile difficulties of physical or psychological origin. Hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women is the main physical treatment that will enhance sexual function through its action on the vaginal epithelium and the vulval and clitoral erectile tissues.",

Such measurement is now considered to be a key factor in the assessment of patients with conditions such as functional dyspepsia, where there is chronic or recurrent unexplained pain or discomfort centred in the upper abdomen. QOL measures may be used to try and discriminate among a number of disease groups or to assess change in disease status over time; different approaches are usually necessary to meet these goals.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive compulsive disorder is a severe and disabling clinical condition that usually arises in late adolescence or early adulthood and, if left untreated, has a chronic course. Objectives To report and discuss a clinical case, followed by the authors. Aims/Methods Consultation of the patient's medical file, serial clinical evaluations and scientific literature review. Results 33 years-old male, married, degree in economics. Observed in the emergency room for having thoughts dominated by ideas of obsessive content, with a sense of self-reference, associated with recurrent compulsions as cleaning and checking rituals, consequential high levels of hopelessness and a depressive mood, with jeopardized chronobiological rhythms. This clinical condition started seven years before and seriously undermined the patient’s autonomy. Some of the difficulties outlined by the patient are: on his way to and from work, whenever he passed by a crosswalk he would circle the following roundabout several times, to confirm that he hadn't run over any pedestrian; at the end of the day, he would go through the same path in reverse, by bicycle, to confirm that no pedestrians had been run over by him. After two years of psychopharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy the patient showed significant clinical improvement. Conclusions On this case, the most likely diagnosis is an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The particularity of this case lays on its severity, given its evolution period, the psychopathological richness demonstrated and the functional commitment of the patient; and in the significant clinical improvements observed, largely due to optimal patient adherence to treatment.",

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

The presence of comorbid disorders such as substance abuse and schizophrenia have a strong negative predictive value with respect to the course, the prognosis, and the outcome of antisocial and psychopathic disorders. Furthermore, there are substantial gender differences. The rates for spontaneous remission and improvement of antisocial and psychopathic personality disorders are possibly relatively high.

So that the current review is aimed at describing different types of sexual dysfunction and the available treatment approaches. Methods: The available literatures were reviewed thoroughly and pooled.Results: The high prevalence of sexual problems was confirmed by data derived from the National Health and Social Life Survey. Even in a cohort of younger men ages 18 to 59, 31 percent suffered from sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction is multi-factorial problem. It may be caused by drugs, psychogenic causes, chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiac problems and trauma. By considering these their diagnosis shouldn’t be overlooked by clinicians and the patients should consult their providers about their sexual problem.Conclusion: The optimal treatment for sexual dysfunction should be individualized, based on a patient’s symptoms, expectations, and underlying variant causes.",

Special considerations for this population include laboratory studies to identify possible secondary medical abnormalities that may either accompany or derive from the depressed mood, and pharmacologic treatments that have been shown to be more efficacious in aging men.

      "abstract": "Актуальность. Депрессивные расстройства в пожилом возрасте часто не распознаются или неадекватно лечатся, утяжеляют течение и прогноз коморбидной патологии, приводят к потере трудоспособности, к еще большему физическому упадку, ухудшают качество жизни не только пациентов, но и их окружения; приводят к суицидальному поведению. При депрессивных расстройствах в пожилом возрасте наблюдается ослабление когнитивных функций, проявляющееся в затруднении при выполнении сложных заданий, замедлении темпа, нарушении концентрации внимания и затруднений в принятии решений. Однако при психометрических исследованиях способности к репродукции, значительных отличий от здоровых пожилых людей часто не выявляются. Целью исследования явилось выделение некоторых клинико-психопатологические особенности депрессий с суицидальным поведением в позднем возрасте. Материалы и методы исследования. Работа проводилась в РГП на ПХВ “Республиканском научно-практическом центре психического здоровья” МЗ РК г. Алматы. Материалом послужили больные депрессией с суицидальным поведением в позднем возрасте, проходившие стационарное лечение в РНПЦ ППН в 2016-2021 гг. Основными методами исследования являлись клинико-психопатологический, клинико-катамнестический, длительность катамнеза составила от 1 до 6 лет. Были использованы также экспериментально-психологический метод, психометрические шкалы: шкалы личностной и ситуативной тревожности (по Спилбергеру), шкала депрессии (по Цунгу) для определения степени выраженности депрессии и тревоги. Результаты. Наблюдение показало, что течение психоза у больных исследуемой группы характеризовалось развитием повторных приступов (один приступ перенесли только 5 больных, что, возможно, объясняется коротким периодом катамнестического наблюдения). В 8 наблюдениях это были монополярные приступы в рамках рекуррентного депрессивного расстройства. В остальных случаях наряду с депрессивными приступами возникали и гипоманиакальные состояния, чаще всего в виде кратковременных подъёмов настроения. Больные, достаточно критически, относились к своей болезни и при этом опасались повторения приступов. Почти у всех больных сохранялась резидуальная аффективная симптоматика. Стертые гипоманиакальные или субдепрессивные состояния возникали аутохтонно, либо в виде реакций на различные внешние раздражители. Выводы. Депрессивные расстройства в позднем возрасте имеют ряд клинических особенностей, представляющих высокую суицидогенность. Преобладание в картине психоза тревожных депрессий, нередко с ажитацией; ипохондрических расстройств, включающих ипохондрические идеи от тревожных и фобических опасений до ипохондрического бреда с разнообразными алгическими сенсациями, повышают суицидальную опасность больных. Introduction. Depressive disorders in old age are often not recognized or inadequately treated, aggravate the course and prognosis of comorbid pathology, lead to disability, to even greater physical decline, worsen the quality of life not only of patients, but also of their environment; lead to suicidal behavior. With depressive disorders in old age, there is a weakening of cognitive functions, manifested in difficulty in performing complex tasks, slowing down the pace, impaired concentration and difficulties in making decisions. However, in psychometric studies of the ability to reproduce, significant differences from healthy elderly people are often not revealed. The aim to identify some clinical and psychopathological features of depression with suicidal behavior at a late age. Materials and methods of research. The work was carried out in the Republican Scientific and Practical center of Mental Health of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The material was used by patients with depression with suicidal behavior at a late age who underwent inpatient treatment at the RSPCMH MH RK in 2016-2021. The main research methods were clinical-psychopathological, clinical-catamnestic, the duration of the catamnesis ranged from 1 to 6 years. An experimental psychological method, psychometric scales were also used: the scales of personal and situational anxiety (according to Spielberger), the scale of depression (according to Tsung) to determine the severity of depression and anxiety. Results. The observation showed that the course of psychosis in the patients of the study group was characterized by the development of repeated seizures (only 5 patients suffered one attack, which may be explained by the short period of catamnestic observation). In 8 cases, these were monopolar seizures within the framework of recurrent depressive disorder. In other cases, along with depressive attacks, hypomanic states also occurred, most often in the form of short-term mood swings. The patients were quite critical of their illness and at the same time were afraid of a recurrence of seizures. Almost all patients retained residual affective symptoms. Erased hypomanic or subdepressive states occurred autochthonously or in the form of reactions to various external stimuli. Conclusions. Depressive disorders in late life have a number of clinical features that represent high suicidogenicity. The predominance of anxiety depressions in the picture of psychosis, often with agitation; hypochondriac disorders, including hypochondriac ideas from anxiety and phobic fears to hypochondriac delirium with various algic sensations, increase the suicidal danger of patients.

Егде жастағы депрессиялық бұзылулар жиі анықталмайды немесе жеткіліксіз емделеді, қатар жүретін патологияның барысы мен болжамын ауырлатады, еңбекке жарамсыздыққа, одан да көп физикалық құлдырауға әкеледі, пациенттердің ғана емес, сонымен қатар олардың қоршаған ортасының өмір сүру сапасын нашарлатады; суицидтік мінез-құлыққа әкеледі. Егде жастағы депрессиялық бұзылуларда когнитивті функциялардың әлсіреуі байқалады, бұл күрделі тапсырмаларды орындаудағы қиындықтарда, қарқынның баяулауында, зейіннің нашарлауында және шешім қабылдаудағы қиындықтарда көрінеді. Алайда, психометриялықзерттеулерде ұрпақ өрбіту қабілетінде, дені сау егде жастағы адамдардан айтарлықтай айырмашылықтар жиі анықталмайды.

Жұмыс ҚРДМ “Республикалық психикалық денсаулық ғылыми-практикалық орталығы” ШЖҚ РМК жүргізілді. Материал 2016-2021 жылдары “РПДҒПО” стационарлық емдеуден өткен егде жастағы суицидтік мінез-құлқы бар депрессиямен ауыратын науқастар болды. Зерттеудің негізгі әдістері клиникалық-психопатологиялық, клиникалық-катамнестикалық болды, катамнездің ұзақтығы 1 жылдан 6 жылға дейін болды. Эксперименттік-психологиялық әдіс, психометриялық шкалалар да қолданылды: жеке және ситуациялық мазасыздық шкалалары (Спилбергер бойынша), депрессия мен мазасыздықтың ауырлығын анықтау үшін депрессия шкаласы (Цунг бойынша) қолданылды. Нәтижелер. Бақылау көрсеткендей, зерттеу тобындағы науқастардағы психоздың ағымы қайталанған шабуылдардың дамуымен сипатталды (тек 5 науқас бір шабуылға ұшырады, бұл катамнестикалық бақылаудың қысқа кезеңімен түсіндірілуі мүмкін). 8 бақылауда бұл қайталанатын депрессиялық бұзылыстың бөлігі ретінде монополярлық шабуылдар болды. Басқа жағдайларда, депрессиялық шабуылдармен қатар, гипоманикалық жағдайлар да пайда болды, көбінесе қысқа мерзімді көңіл-күйдің көтерілуі түрінде. Науқастар өздерінің ауруларына өте сын көзбен қарады және сонымен бірге шабуылдардың қайталануынан қорқады. Барлық дерлік науқастарда резидуальды аффективті белгілер сақталды. Жойылған гипоманикалық немесе субдепрессиялық күйлер аутохтонды немесе әртүрлі сыртқы ынталандыруларға реакциялар түрінде пайда болды. Қорытынды: Егде жастағы депрессиялық бұзылулар жоғары суицидогенділікті білдіретін бірқатар клиникалық белгілерге ие. Зерттеу көрсеткендей егде жастағы мазасыздық депрессиясының, психоздың басым болуы, көбінесе толқумен; гипохондриялық бұзылулар, соның ішінде гипохондриялық идеялар, мазасыздық пен фобиялық қорқыныштан бастап, әртүрлі алгиялық сенсациялары бар гипохондриялықсандыраққа дейін, науқастардың суицидтік қаупін арттыратыны анықталды.",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "abstract": "The concept of prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia is an old matter of debate. There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Sexual sadistic and masochistic disorders fall into the paraphilic disorders according to the DSM-5 classification. Paraphilic disorders are defined as persistent, intense and atypical forms of sexual excitement that appear with clinically significant functional impairment. The original clinical use of the terms sadism and masochism was to describe the sexual perversions of attaining sexual pleasure by hurting or being hurt. These terms have been usefully expanded to mean emotional sadism and masochism: experiencing emotional satisfaction or comfort due to exercising power over another or submitting to another’s power. This disorder begins at an early age and most sadists and masochists are actually satisfied with their unconventional sexual activity. Personality disorders are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, based on descriptive similarities. Group B in the classification of personality disorder is composed of an antisocial, histrionic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorder. People who fall into this group are characterized by impulsiveness and emotional instability, in their behavior they are dramatic and mischievous. Unlike true love, falling in love by itself is not a conscious choice nor a willing act. Love constitutes a voluntary act with which spritiual growth and maturity of ourselves and others is achieved. Similarly, love is action, not a feeling. In every long-lasting romantic relationship, including sadomasochistic ones, mutual respect and paying atttention play a major role.",

Directions in their life are absent or their set is very limited. Their behavior is frequently situation-dependent. Social and psychological dysadaptation results from that the individual inadequately appraises the life situation and hence inadequately responds to the latter. The socially unacceptable behavior becomes normal up to criminogenic (theft, violence). In the homeless with tuberculosis, a change occurs in the structural hierarchy of vital activity motives by the motive-for-objective type. In this connection, there is a paradoxical attitude towards the disease for the purpose of acquiring a social benefit. In the homeless, the factors that are frustrating and inducing stress in ordinarily persons cause no emotional responses. This was a result of the mental defense worked out under constant stress.",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction in Patients with Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Challenges and Opportunities",
      "abstract": "Quality-of-life issues in healthcare have come to be of paramount importance for a population that increasingly expects healthcare not only to treat major illnesses but also to optimize normal levels of physical and psychosocial functioning and overall well-being. Healthcare providers have also increasingly appreciated the impact that adverse effects of treatment can have on quality of life, as well as on compliance with and the effectiveness of treatment. Many functional impairments and adverse treatment effects take the form of clinical complaints that patients and caregivers typically report to their healthcare providers without prompting. Other adverse effects are not so obviously clinical or treatment-related, and patients may not be inclined or may even be reluctant to bring them up when talking with the provider. Impairment of sexual function is a problem of this kind. Sexual dysfunction appears to be common and frequently underrecognized in certain patient populations. For example, it has been estimated that 25% to 63% of women and 10% to 52% of men with epilepsy have some form of sexual dysfunction, yet in clinical reviews of sexual disorders, epilepsy is not listed as one of the medical conditions commonly associated with impaired sexual function.",

      "abstract": "The psychological manifestation of ED often includes performance anxiety and may lead to high levels of distress and damage to self-esteem and manhood. If unchecked, this may have significant implications for patients' sexual and intimate relationships and broader psychosocial functioning. The assessment of ED should therefore identify any psychological (patients' and their partners') and interpersonal factors that may be contributing to ED etiology as well as potential sources of resistance, non-adherence, or treatment dropout. Gathering this information will help the clinician identify potential barriers to treatment, which can then be addressed early to optimize pharmaceutical treatment and restoration of sexual function. Rather than focusing solely on ED symptoms, clinicians should address the impact of ED and treatment on the broader sexual experience for men and their partners using direct, non-threatening questions Alternatively, the clinician may use brief self-report questionnaires to introduce the topic of ED or screen for depressive and anxiety symptoms. The clinician may want to include partners in the assessment or treatment stages. It is beyond the scope of clinicians treating ED to address long-standing psychopathology or disordered personality traits, though assessment of these factors will give insight into potential psychological and interpersonal causes of ED. Referrals may be used to address broader psychological or relationship problems.",

Longitudinal studies of older adults with major depression report that a significant proportion of patients do not fully recover. Partial remission or symptoms of major depression that do not meet criteria for major depression, is predicted by 1) clinical factors, such higher number of symptoms at diagnosis, presence of comorbid dysthymia, and health problems; 2) social variables, such as high levels of perceived stress and low levels of perceived social support; and 3) perceived health/well-being variables, such as limitations in mobility or instrumental activities of daily living, poorer self-perceived health, finding life not satisfying, and looking back over life and finding it unhappy. Treatment options include antidepressants (alone or in combination) and psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disorder that is characterized by severe and debilitating fatigue of at least 6 months duration not explained on the basis of medical and psychiatric illnesses and has other associated characteristics. The disorder has a resemblance to many other disorders described in the past including myalgic encephalitis and post-infective fatigue; however, the term itself and the criteria for diagnosing this disorder were first laid out in 1988. The disorder has received attention from a wide range of clinicians and researchers. The mechanism of causation of this disorder has been poorly understood, though biological, psychological and social factors seem to play a role. The disorder causes significant impairment and is highly comorbid with other disorders. Non-pharmacological measures like graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy seem to work better for treatment than pharmacological measures. This narrative review takes an overview of chronic fatigue syndrome from a generalist standpoint and looks into the clinical features, etiopathogenesis and management of this disorder.",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6. Anhaltendes Spielen bzw. Wetten trotz Nachweises eindeutiger schädlicher Folgen, wie z.B. finanzieller Schädigung durch exzessives Spielen.",

      "abstract": "Psychological stress is implicated as one element in a constellation of risk factors for the development and maintenance of psychosomatic disease. Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

This condition is one of the most common sexual problems for men and increases with age, but it's not a natural part of ageing. Approximately one half of men aged 40 years and older have erection problems. Most men have difficulty achieving an erection from time to time, and such occurrences are considered normal. However, ED may be a regular and more severe problem in some men. It can cause low self-esteem, performance anxiety, depression and stress, and may also affect the quality of a marriage or intimate relationships. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, participating in more exercise, stopping smoking and minimising the risk of heart disease, may help to improve the condition. The introduction of the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of ED. Surgery may be considered when these inhibitors and other approaches fail or are contraindicated.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of animal well-being is a complex matter. It is difficult to establish a causal link between stimuli and internal state because of numerous variables and the time interval between cause and effect. Many studies document a correlation rather than a causal relationship among stimuli, responses, and subsequent health, disease, or mental state. Research objectives are often vague, the choice of assessment parameters is perplexing, and the results are difficult to interpret. In general, animal well-being cannot be assessed directly. There are no standardized methods or specific endpoints that provide an objective determination. Overt changes in physical and psychological functions occur only after the animal has experienced a prepathologic state. An animal's response to general arousal, life's events, and aversive stimuli depends on an integrated activation of various neural and endocrine factors. A variety of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics change when an animal is exposed to aversive situations and stimuli, although many also change with the onset of positive general arousal, such as play, pleasant experiences, and sexual excitement. There is a need to evaluate numerous criteria (e.g., performance, clinical state, neurochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, morphology, behavior, and ethology) to compile a complete mental and biological profile of animals. The various systems, processes, and individual specific responses are interrelated and interact in a well-structured manner. Given the complexity of the topic and the disparate disciplines involved, developing a comprehensive understanding of animal well-being is not straightforward. Consequently, observers should be cautious. Foremost in any determination of animal well-being is assurance that criteria being used are relevant to well-being.",

      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

The karyotype 47,XXY originates from either paternal or maternal meiotic nondisjunction during gametogenesis. KS males are very likely to exhibit marked gonadal dysfunctions, presenting both in severely attenuated spermatogenesis as well as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. In addition, neurocognitive and psychosocial impairments, as well as cardiovascular, metabolic and bone disorders are often found in KS and might explain for an increased morbidity/mortality. All conditions in KS are likely to be induced by both gene overdosage effects resulting from supernumerary X‐chromosomal genes as well as testosterone deficiency. Notwithstanding, the clinical features are highly variable between KS men. Symptoms can become obvious at infancy, childhood, or adolescence. However, the majority of KS subjects is diagnosed during adulthood. KS adolescents require specific attention regarding pubertal development, in order to exploit their remaining fertility potential and allow for timely and tailored testosterone replacement. The chances for sperm retrieval might decline with age and could be hampered by testosterone replacement; therefore, cryostorage of spermatozoa is an option during adolescence, before the decompensation of endocrine and exocrine testicular functions becomes more overt. Sperm from semen or surgically retrieved, in combination with intracytoplasmic sperm injection enables KS males to become biological fathers of healthy children. The aim of this article is to present the current knowledge on KS, to guide clinical care and to highlight research needs.",

Its primary symptoms are \"severe, recurrent temper outbursts\" (manifested verbally and/or physically) superimposed on and associated with chronic irritability. DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Prostatitis, a common condition in men, is known to significantly impact quality of life (QoL) by affecting daily activities, mental health, and sexual function. This review examines the relationship between prostatitis and QoL, with a focus on chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), the most prevalent form. The physical symptoms of prostatitis, including chronic pelvic pain and urinary issues, can lead to fatigue, disrupted social participation, and limitations in work and physical activity. Psychologically, prostatitis is linked to anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness, which can exacerbate the severity of physical symptoms and reduce overall well-being. Sexual dysfunction, particularly erectile dysfunction, is a frequent concern for men with prostatitis, compounding mental health challenges and further diminishing QoL. Traditional treatments, including antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications, provide limited relief for some patients. However, alternative therapies like physical therapy, acupuncture, and herbal remedies show promise in addressing both physical and psychological symptoms. A multidisciplinary treatment approach, incorporating both symptom management and mental health support, is crucial for improving the overall QoL of men suffering from prostatitis. This review highlights the need for comprehensive interventions to address the multidimensional impact of prostatitis on daily life, mental health, and sexual function.",

      "abstract": "Marriage can be defined as the state of being united as spouses in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law. The general population generally believes marriage to be a solution to mental illnesses. It can be agreed that mental disorders and marital issues have some relation. Parents of patients with psychoses expect that marriage is the solution to the illness and often approach doctors and seek validation about the success of the marriage of their mentally ill child, which is a guarantee no doctor can give in even normal circumstances. Evidence on sexual functioning in patients of psychosis is limited and needs further understanding. Studies show about 60%–70% women of the schizophrenia spectrum and illness to experience sexual difficulties. Based on available information, sexual dysfunction in population with psychosis can be attributed to a variety of psychosocial factors, ranging from the psychotic symptoms in itself to social stigma and institutionalization and also due to the antipsychotic treatment. Despite the decline in sexual activity and quality of life in general, it is very rarely addressed by both the treating doctor and by the patient themselves hence creating a lacuna in the patient’s care and availability of information regarding the illness’ pathophysiology. Patients become noncompliant with medications due to this undesirable effect and hence it requires to be given more attention during treatment. It was also found that paranoid type of schizophrenia patient had lower chances of separation than patients with other types of schizophrenia. The risk of relapse in cases with later age of onset of the disease, lower education, a positive family history of psychosis or a lower income increased more than other populations.",

Many times, depression of the elderly is underdiagnosed and remains insufficiently treated. Drug therapy should be associated with psychotherapy, in order to improve patient compliance and motivation. The antidepressants existing nowadays in therapy are more selective and with fewer side effects than the first generation antidepressants: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertralin), serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (as venlafaxine) are preferred, taking into account the multiple health conditions that may coexist in the elderly patient.",

      "title": "Male Depression – Are gender-related personality traits associated with the severity of depressive symptoms?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Higher prevalence &amp; incidence rates of depressive disorder in women compared with men are among the recurring findings from epidemiologic &amp; clinical studies. The literature suggests that this is not due to a lower need for treatment of depression in men. In the context of the concept ‘male depression’ (MD), it is often argued that men tend to have so called ‘non-typical’ depressive symptoms. These symptoms (such as aggressiveness, irritability, alcohol use, risk-taking &amp; antisocial behavior) are rarely considered in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, which may lead to underdiagnosis. With regard to the occurrence of ‘non-typical’ depressive symptoms and the concept MD, the importance of masculine personality traits is often discussed. The topic of the session is the extent to which gender-related personality traits such as masculine, feminine, androgynous &amp; undifferentiated are associated with the occurrence and severity of ‘non-typical’ and ‘typical’ depressive symptoms in women and men with a depressive disorder. Objectives The results of a study in a clinical setting will be presented. The aim of the study was to investigate whether above mentioned gender-related personality traits are associated with increased severity of depressive symptoms and whether there are differences between women &amp; men. Methods Depressive symptoms (GMDS &amp; BDI II) and gender-related personality traits (GEPAQ) were assessed in female &amp; male patients (≥ 18 years) with an unipolar depressive disorder (ICD-10). Participants were recruited from inpatient settings &amp; day clinics of specialized psychiatric-psychotherapeutic hospitals in Germany. The multicenter study with a cross-sectional design has been completed. Data from the clinical sample were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. Results Multiple linear regression analysis: criteria variable GMDS &amp; predicting variable GEPAQ ( masculine pt) b-coefficient women = -1.36 (n.s.) &amp; b-coefficient men = -1.48 (p ≤ .01); criteria variable GMDS &amp; predicting variable GEPAQ (feminin pt) b-coefficient women = .12 (n.s.) &amp; b-coefficient men = .79 (n.s.); criteria variable BDI II &amp; predicting variable GEPAQ ( masculine pt) b-coefficient women = -1.72 (n.s.) &amp; b-coefficient men = -4.23 (p ≤ .01); criteria variable BDI II &amp; predicting variable GEPAQ (feminin pt) b-coefficient women = .95 (n.s.) &amp; b-coefficient men = .-24 (n.s.) Conclusions Gender-related personality traits are associated with the occurrence and severity of ‘non-typical’ &amp; ‘typical’ depressive symptoms. They should be considered in the diagnosis &amp; treatment of depression. Gender differences have also been identified. In men, the expression of masculine personality traits does not lead to an increase in depressive symptoms, especially not in ‘non-typical’ depressive symptoms, as was originally thought. Based on these and other recent findings, the concept of MD can be critically discussed. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

There is, however, a marked decline in medication adherence in adolescence, which continues into adulthood, with less than 10% of adults with ADHD continuing to use medication. Moreover, psychosocial treatments too often do not continue to be used or adapted to new challenges. Thus, it is difficult to conclude what impact medication and/or psychosocial treatments would have on adult outcomes should these treatments be adhered to and applied continuously. As it stands, the lack of impact from treatments in childhood suggests that ADHD is a chronic condition, and that ongoing regular follow-up may be needed to offer patients interventions (medication and psychosocial treatment) that they require both to improve their symptoms in the short-term and promote more positive long-term outcome.",

      "title": "Alcohol Abuse",
      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper argues that the lack of strong prospective evidence linking occupational and social stress to chronic disease stems from the failure of research designs to attend sufficiently to the aetiological chronicity of such diseases. Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

MUS is a working hypothesis based on the assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated but clinical condition presented by the patient was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS. The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels. Therefore the exploration of symptoms in patients with MUS should focus on the exact chronology of the symptoms themselves, including where and when the symptoms appear. Based on the exploration of symptoms, the clinician is able to evaluate the severity of MUS.",

These features create psychological needs for patients which should be responded to by an integrated basic psychosomatic care. This includes respect and empathy, patient centered communication, adequate response to negative emotions, establishment of a helpful and lasting therapeutic relationship, psychoeducation, empowerment and shared decision making. Apart from this basic psychosomatic care which can be provided by each treating physician or nurse, some conditions need more specialized psychosomatic care in the context of a multidisciplinary team: Chronic pain services, Infertility treatment teams, Sexual counselling and therapy and treatment of psychiatric comorbities or sequelae of the disease like depression, anxiety disorder etc. Psychosomatic care should thus be integrated into the biomedical diagnosis and therapy of endometriosis.",

Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Estos pacientes suelen recibir un diagnóstico clínico de “trastorno de la personalidad”, pero probablemente sea más apropiado describirlos como pacientes “multiproblemáticos” debido a los déficits ampliamente extendidos en su funcionamiento cognitivo, emocional, conductual y social. Estos pacientes suelen experimentar estados emocionales negativos crónicos, como depresión, ansiedad, apatía, aburrimiento, soledad, culpa e ira. Este afectividad alterada es el principal impulsor de una plétora de respuestas de afrontamiento desadaptativas: las principales son la conducta suicida repetitiva y las conductas adictivas como el abuso de alcohol/drogas, los trastornos alimentarios y/o la automutilación crónica. Los pacientes multiproblemáticos también experimentan importantes déficits en el funcionamiento social e interpersonal.

      "title": "Premenstruális szindróma és premenstruális dysphoriás zavar.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak a mindennapi életben, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS és a premenstruációs dysphoriás zavar (PMDD) diagnózisa a következő kritériumok alapján állítható fel a Premenstruális Rendellenességek Nemzetközi Társaságának (International Society for Premenstrual Disorders – ISPMD) ajánlása szerint: a PMS esetében a nőnek 1–4 tünete van, amelyek lehetnek fizikai, viselkedési vagy affektív/pszichológiai jellegűek, vagy minimum 5 tünettel rendelkezik, melyek fizikai vagy viselkedési jellegűek. Ha viszont egy nőnek 5 vagy több tünete van, és ezek közül az egyik affektív tünet (például ingerlékenység, hangulatingadozás, düh) a fizikai vagy viselkedési tünetek mellett, akkor a pontosabb PMDD diagnózisa állítható fel. A diagnózisok megerősítéséhez az általános és a nőgyógyászati anamnézis mellett a páciens által naponta kitöltött prospektív skálák, például a menstruációs tünetek hatásának és súlyosságának prospektív nyilvántartása, továbbá a problémák súlyosságának napi nyilvántartási skálája jelent segítséget. A terápiás terv kialakításakor fontos figyelembe venni a tünetek súlyosságát, a nő fogamzási terveit vagy fogamzásgátlási igényeit, a társuló egyéb betegségeit és a korábbi kezelési módszerekre adott válaszát. A terápiás lehetőségek közé tartozik – a PMS és a PMDD súlyosságától függően – a rendszeres aerob testmozgás, a stresszoldás, a kognitív viselkedésterápia, a gyógyszeres kezelések (szelektív szerotoninvisszavétel-gátlók, kombinált oralis ösztrogén-progesztin fogamzásgátlók, GnRH-agonisták).

      "title": "Affective and manic depression",
      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

The current case is a 40-year-old female who experienced such orgasms for about a month. Physical examination, investigations, and psychological testing were noncontributory. Carbamazepine (600 mg) was discontinued due to a lack of response. She improved significantly with supportive therapy. Various neuropsychological conditions, pelvic pathology, medications, etc., have been associated with this disorder. Pharmacologic strategies have included the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and analgesics. Validation, psycho-education, identifying triggers, distraction techniques, and pelvic massage have been tried. Living with PGAD is very demanding. There is a lack of understanding of the problem, shame, and hesitation to seek help. The syndrome has been recently described, and understanding is still evolving.",

After several operations her symptoms worsened, the incontinence being almost complete and activity entirely precluded. Nocturnal enuresis also appeared. Psychological investigation revealed emotional immaturity after an unhappy childhood with many frustrations. There was no opportunity for deeper psychological treatment and supportive psychotherapy aided by hypnosis for symptom removal was used. The symptoms disappeared, the patient was able to return to social life and was still active 3 years later.",

Daartoe horen de psychosomatische klachten die lijken te worden veroorzaakt of verergerd door psychische factoren en niet door een bepaalde ziekte. Vaak ontstaan deze klachten bij stress of heftige levensgebeurtenissen. Voor mensen met een verstandelijke beperking ligt dat percentage zelfs nog veel hoger. Door de cognitieve, sociale en emotionele beperkingen is de doelgroep vatbaarder voor stress en lichamelijke klachten. Door de beperkingen van de doelgroep moet de behandeling in de psychomotorische therapie worden aangepast om een zo goed mogelijk resultaat te behalen.\nMevrouw J. wordt voor psychomotorische therapie bij mij aangemeld. Ze heeft een verleden van seksueel misbruik en heeft een matige verstandelijke beperking. In haar dossier lees ik dat ze al tien jaar psychosomatische klachten heeft en de afgelopen maanden klaagt over duizeligheid. Ze denkt zelf dat dit een evenwichtstoornis is. Medisch is geen fysieke oorzaak gesteld. Ze loopt met ondersteuning of krukken. Wanneer we gaan tafeltennissen komt er schot in de behandeling. Tijdens dit spel heeft ze steun aan de tafel, is ze zelfstandig bezig en op een speelse manier in beweging. Dit gaat goed, ze haalt elk balletje en rent achter de balletjes aan.

      "title": "Antiandrogenic treatment of obsessive compulsive neurosis: A case review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder in which patients who suffer from it have repetitive and undesirable thoughts, feelings, ideas, sensations (obsessions) and behaviors that drive them to do something over and over again (compulsions). Often the person tries to get rid of the obsessive thoughts through compulsions, but this only provides short-term relief. Not carrying out the obsessive rituals can cause enormous anxiety and suffering. Objectives To describe a 23-year-old male patient, who suffers from anxiety and mood symptoms, reacts to ego-dystonic obsessive ideas and sexual content, of months of evolution, and who manages to calm down through compulsive masturbation or watching sexual videos on the internet. All this clinic negatively interferes with their quality of life, asking the patient for medical help to calm these ideas. Methods We carried out a review in Pubmed with the terms Antiandrogens and TOC, in order to make a better description of the clinical case. Results After several treatment attempts (Sertraline, Paroxetine, Clomipramine, Clomipramine + SSRI), reaching maximum doses according to clinical guidelines, and with poor therapeutic response, it was decided to discuss the case with the endocrinology department of our hospital, deciding to start treatment with antiandrogens, in order to alleviate the persistent intrusive ideas of a sexual nature. The administration of antiandrogens in men can cause a decrease or increase in the development or involution of secondary sexual characteristics in men, reducing the activity or function of accessory sexual organs, and hyposexuality, with decreased sexual desire or libido. After several weeks, there was improvement in the obsessive symptoms with a decrease in compulsive rituals. However, after the 3rd mo, some symptoms reappeared, but not with the same severity and intensity as before treatment. In addition, we cannot ignore the adverse effects that have occurred, such as involution of secondary sexual characteristics. However, and taking into account the negative repercussion that this clinic had on the patient’s quality of life, the benefit obtained exceeded the risk, having noted clear improvement with this therapy, and maintaining evolutionary controls by both psychiatry and endocrinology. Conclusions Patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder can be effectively treated with anti-androgenic pharmacological agents with various modes of action. The most effective group of such agents is the long-acting analogues of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The objective of this review is to elucidate the possibility of using such powerful anti-androgenic agents in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive substances are believed to be aphrodisiac; but in reality they have deleterious effects on all the aspects of sexual function. The purpose of this article is to review and summarize the available scientific literature on the impact of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs on erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. Almost all of them have been reported to be associated with ED. These substances may exert their inhibitory effect on erection through their effects on central neurotransmitter pathways (serotogenic, adrenergic or dopaminergic). Besides, some also may exhibit vasoconstricting properties (cocaine), impair endothelium function (nicotine) or suppress the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary, resulting in hypogonadism (morphine) to induce ED. The relationship between ED and psychoactive substances is attributed not only to pharmacological effects, but also to psychological and social reactions to substance dependence. Whether withdrawal from the substances could restore erectile function remains unknown. However, human and animal studies demonstrated that the effects of neurological damage from chronic substance abuse are long-lasting. This information of sexual consequence of the substances will be of great general interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue can refer to a subjective symptom of malaise and aversion to activity or to objectively impaired performance. It has both physical and mental aspects. The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",

      "abstract": "Female orgasmic disorder (FOD) is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, as a persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a 'normal' sexual excitement phase. FOD is a common problem affecting sexual function in a substantial proportion of women. Studies suggest that it is prevalent in 11–41% of women worldwide and can have a tremendous impact on the individual's quality of life, relational satisfaction and general well-being. The etiology of FOD tends to be multifactorial as it relates to genetics, medical conditions, medications, alcohol and drug use, other sexual dysfunctions, mental illness, life stressors, communication deficits and relationship issues. It is critical that sexual functioning in patients is assessed frequently through interview and/or validated questionnaires to aid in treatment strategy and/or referral. Currently, there are no approved medications to treat FOD. However, there are medications and psychological treatments that have shown promise in either treating FOD or thwarting the side effects of medications that can cause FOD. This chapter discusses the epidemiology and etiology of FOD and provides a comprehensive critical review of the literature on assessment and treatment of FOD.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD.

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used.

Usually it occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, being extremely rare in western countries. The condition is more common in males and is classified within Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders. Case report A 27-year-old single man was referred to the psychiatric department. By the age of 23, he began worrying that his penis was shrinking and retracting into the abdomen. He described these thoughts as intrusive, ridiculous and repetitive. During the first months the thoughts were not very disturbing but he progressively developed an urge to verify the length of his penis several times a day. To diminish the anxiety provoked by the obsessive doubts on penis length, he started to have repetitive thoughts and mental images about sexual acts, to consume pornography compulsively and to increase his masturbatory behaviors (from some times a week to several times a day). He described those thoughts and behaviors as unpleasant and uniquely driven to reduce anxiety provoked by obsessions. He was prescribed fluvoxamine 200 mg/day and initiated cognitive behavioral therapy with good response. Y-BOCS score decreased from 30 at initial evaluation to 18 after 3 months of treatment. Conclusions Koro syndrome is a very rare condition in psychiatry in western countries, usually presenting secondarily to other psychiatric disorders.

      "title": "The Impact of Psychotropics on Sexuality: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunctions related to psychotropic drugs are among the most distressing adverse effects and can lead to non-adherence to treatment. Objectives To elucidate the mechanisms of psychotropic-induced sexual dysfunctions and to suggest strategies for their management. Methods Literature review based on the keywords “psychotropics,” “sexuality,” and “sexual dysfunction”. Results Psychotropic medications can impact sexuality either directly or indirectly. The direct effect is primarily due to a decrease in the mesocortical dopaminergic atmosphere, either by blocking D2 receptors or by stimulating 5HT2A receptors. D2 receptor blockade in the tubero-infundibular pathway triggers an increase in prolactin secretion, which can subsequently lead to erection problems, decreased libido, and difficulties achieving orgasm. Action in the nigrostriatal pathway may result in an extrapyramidal syndrome, which can, in turn, hinder intimate physical relations. The indirect effect can also be caused by metabolic complications, which are significant risk factors for sexual dysfunction, as they can lead to male hypogonadism and a negative self-image. Therapeutic strategies suggest either reducing doses (if the patient’s condition allows), changing the drug, or adding an adjunctive medication. Aripiprazole, being a partial agonist of D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist of D3 and 5-HT2A receptors, appears to cause fewer sexual dysfunctions and can reduce hyperprolactinemia when added to other antipsychotics. Conclusions Healthcare professionals must proactively gather information on sexuality given its impact on quality of life and treatment adherence. Prioritizing this dimension of well-being demonstrates a respectful approach toward the patient and establishes the foundation for a strong therapeutic alliance.

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "title": "The promise of social recovery therapy in non‐affective psychoses",
      "abstract": "Non-affective psychoses (schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorders) are the health conditions of working age adults most frequently associated with poor social outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies suggest that less than 50% of people with these conditions achieve social recovery, less than 15% achieve sustained recovery in both symptomatic and social domains, and only 10-20% of people return to competitive employment, despite the majority reporting that they wish to work1. Social recovery therapy (SRT) is a psychosocial treatment to promote social recovery in people with non-affective psychosis who are socially withdrawn, have complex and comorbid problems, and are unresponsive to existing interventions. It is based on a model in which social disability evolves as a result of lifestyle patterns of low activity, adopted to achieve behavioral avoidance, and maintained by lack of hope, agency and motivation. Social disability in psychosis typically occurs in the context of persistent positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, often accompanied by depression, anxiety and other psychopathological manifestations. Alongside such issues are complex social circumstances and systemic issues, including problematic family dynamics, victimization, social threat and social deprivation. In the face of such problems, individuals adopt lifestyle patterns of extreme social withdrawal, leaving work or education and losing contact with social networks. SRT is described in a manual2 and delivered individually across 9 months. Sessions take place in participants' homes and community locations. Interim telephone and email contact usually occurs. SRT delivery is structured in three stages. Stage 1 includes assessment and development of a shared social recovery formulation. Stage 2 involves identifying and working towards medium- to long-term goals guided by a systemic formulation of barriers to recovery, with a focus on promoting a sense of agency, hope and motivation, and encouraging activity while managing psychotic symptoms. Stage 3 involves the active promotion of structured activity linked to meaningful goals, while still managing symptoms. The focus of the intervention is on the individual's personal values and goals, identifying problems and barriers to these, then promoting hope for meaningful behavioral change and activity toward these goals. There is a strong emphasis on the use of behavioral strategies (including behavioral experiments, graded exposure and behavioral activation) to overcome avoidance and promote meaningful lifestyle change in vivo whilst managing symptoms as necessary to implement a concrete pathway to social recovery. Evidence and experiences from this behavioral work are used to further instill hope and promote positive beliefs about self as the individual works towards achieving meaningful change in his/her life. As SRT aims to engage people with psychosis into structured activity, it often includes supporting them to access employment, education, training, voluntary and/or leisure opportunities. Much of SRT takes place in community settings. It is often useful for the therapist to drive the client to new locations and settings or accompany him/her on public transport. To achieve gains in social recovery against a background of often years of withdrawal and social disadvantage means that therapists have to integrate techniques typically associated with assertive community treatment and supported employment. Working systemically with families and stakeholders surrounding the individual to promote opportunities in the social environment is also important. Behavioral activation and behavioral experiments are conducted in line with the client's identified goals and values and at a pace respecting the nature of the difficulties faced. The therapist works alongside the client to aid motivation and engagement in identified activities that can be incorporated into daily life, and work out collaborative strategies to manage ongoing symptoms in vivo. To date, we have conducted two assessor-blind randomized controlled trials of SRT in people with psychosis with severe social disability. In the Improving Social Recovery in Early Psychosis (ISREP) trial3, 77 participants with affective or non-affective psychosis presenting social withdrawal were randomized to receive either SRT plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone. TAU consisted of case management from a secondary mental health care team. In the non-affective psychosis group, SRT showed a significant and clinically beneficial effect on the primary outcome of weekly hours in structured activity, as well as on positive and negative symptoms. There was also an effect of SRT on hopelessness and positive beliefs about self, with improvements on these variables being a mediator of the change in structured activity. The intervention was also cost-effective4. SUPEREDEN35 was a larger (N=154) phase 2 trial aimed to enhance social recovery in patients who had not responded to early intervention service (EIS) treatment, by combining standard EIS provision with SRT. The primary analysis indicated that the SRT plus EIS was associated with an average increase in structured activity over 8 hours per week greater than EIS alone (95% CI: 2.5-13.6; p=0.005). The size of the effect represents an amount of activity equivalent to a full working day. There is evidence from both the above trials that the gain from SRT may be maintained 6 months beyond active treatment. In a further separate longer-term follow-up study on the ISREP group6, none of the 24 cases in the TAU group had engaged in paid employment in the year following the end of the intervention period, compared with 5 out of 20 (25%) cases in the SRT+TAU group. SRT offers most promise in promoting social recovery in complex cases of non-affective psychoses in which there is little evidence of response to other interventions. Although the results from the two available randomized controlled trials are positive, further large scale pragmatic studies are needed, possibly being expanded to more chronic cases. There may also be promise in combining SRT approaches with other psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive remediation therapy7. We designed SRT so that it can be delivered in task-sharing formats by a less costly and more widely available workforce than that involved in the above trials. We have now developed extensive training materials, including videos as well as adherence and supervision guidance, which we have collated on a website8. Through this and related work, we have found that it is possible to train \"non-expert therapists\" in key elements of the SRT approach, which can then be successfully implemented following the manual. What is needed in the future is to build on the promise of the existing trials of SRT toward further research and implementation involving non-expert therapists and extending into wider populations of people with non-affective psychosis in the community.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic medical disorder that is the result of a complex interaction of genetic, environmental, neuro-endocrinological, psychosocial, and behavioral factors. There are treatment algorithms, depending on the severity of obesity, and a multi-component approach, including attention to psychological issues, is recommended regardless of the level of obesity. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is beneficial in assisting with stimulus control, self-monitoring of lifestyle changes, goal-setting, and restructuring negative and self-defeating thoughts, and psychodynamic (insight-oriented) psychotherapy is useful in assisting with conflicts regarding excessive weight, body image, relationship to food and disordered patterns of eating, and dealing with the prejudice and overt discrimination obese patients may experience. Neither therapy is particularly effective alone and either and/or both may need to be continued indefinitely to avoid inevitable weight regain. Psychological intervention before and during the difficult process of dieting, as well as before and after bariatric surgery, is essential for some vulnerable patients. Since psychological factors are neither primarily etiological nor even necessarily predominant in obesity, the mental health professional plays an important, though adjunctive--\"psychotherapy-lite\" role--in treating obese patients.",

Existing treatment for CRF patients includes hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation. HD is the most common replacement therapy for kidney function. HD patients often experience severe psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, loneliness, and many difficulties related to stress and unhealthy coping mechanisms. To describe preventive actions against the detrimental effects of loneliness in HD patients. Methods: Literature review. Results: The feeling of loneliness is always annoying and unwanted. Loneliness may limit human development and interfere with normal functioning. It is associated with a sense of hopelessness, abandonment or boredom, reduced self-esteem, alienation, an external sense of control and aggression, depression, hostility, and even suicidal tendencies. Feelings of sadness, loneliness, and fatigue are significant factors in reducing patient treatment adherence and even lead to premature death. Conclusions: It is paramount to cope with disease-related stress and anxiety in healthy ways. Comprehensive psychosocial intervention in HD patients could bring positive impacts on mental well-being to strengthen their sense of self, overcome loneliness, connect with others, and create good resilience for having to live with their chronic illness.

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient.

How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

Factors such as aging, declining testosterone levels, medical illness, certain medications. and comorbid depressive illness can contribute to sexual dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction is one of the more common male sexual dysfunctions encountered in the clinical setting. Comorbidity between erectile dysfunction and depressive illness is high, but the causal relationship is unclear. The psychosocial distress that often accompanies erectile dysfunction might stimulate the development of depressive illness, or, as some data suggest, depression might cause erectile dysfunction. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between depression and erectile dysfunction, as well as the design of a new study that may provide some answers, and concludes that erectile dysfunction is a common, treatable condition that may cause or be the result of depression. Recent data suggest that sildenafil is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction in men with comorbid depression. Erectile dysfunction should be considered a multifactorial condition that may require a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, especially when depression is present.",

Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

Conversely, the risk for individuals with schizophrenia to become a victim of violence is several times higher than that of committing a violent crime. While aggression is part of human nature, mediated, in part, by the interaction of genes and childhood experiences, there is no reason for exculpation of delinquency based on the fact that criminal behaviour has also a biological dimension. Criminal offences often concern decisions based on one’s life-history strategy or evolved psychological mechanisms gone awry, including partner violence (homicide, sexual assault, stalking), paraphilic disorders, and infanticide.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain (constant pain lasting 6 months or longer) is a subjective experience, which is influenced by many pre-morbid (before the onset of pain) psychological problems. However, chronic pain often can produce depression, anxiety, and marital difficulties. Although physical examination and other studies, including x-ray studies, 3D-CT, electromyelograms (EMG), nerve conduction velocity studies and MRI in many cases may document an organic basis of chronic back pain, some organic syndromes defy definition by objective tests. This may be a greater problem for women, where physician prejudice can result in a significantly less extensive evaluation of their complaints of back pain. Also, any litigation may influence symptoms and the type of litigation may influence outcomes [8]. Therefore, there is a need to differentiate between “organic” and “functional” (negative physical and laboratory examination) back pain.",

      "abstract": "espanolLa enuresis nocturna (EN) hace referencia a la incontinencia urinaria nocturna que tiene lugar al menos una vez al mes durante tres meses en ninos de edad igual o superior a cinco anos. La EN es mas frecuente en varones y suele tratarse de una EN primaria y monosintomatica. La EN primaria es aquella en la que no se ha logrado continencia minima de seis meses de forma previa. La EN monosintomatica no se asocia a sintomas nefrourologicos diurnos. La EN suele relacionarse con comorbilidades como el estrenimiento, trastornos del sueno o el TDAH. La predisposicion genetica, los antecedentes personales nefrourologicos y los trastornos psicosociales son algunos de los factores de riesgo en la EN del nino. El diagnostico es clinico y se basa en una historia clinica detallada, exploracion fisica completa y diarios miccionales y de ingesta. El diagnostico diferencial es muy amplio, englobando otras patologias como diabetes mellitus, infeccion de orina, enfermedades nefrourologicas, oxiuros y alteraciones neurologicas. Las pruebas complementarias no estan indicadas de forma rutinaria si la exploracion fisica es normal y no existen signos de alarma. El tratamiento debe individualizarse e incluye educacion sanitaria, terapia motivacional, dispositivos de alarma y farmacos. Los dispositivos de alarma son de eleccion y requieren implicacion del paciente y la familia. La desmopresina se prefiere en ninos con menos de tres noches mojadas a la semana, volumen miccional maximo diurno (VMMD) superior al 75%, edad superior a 9 anos o fracaso del sistema de alarma. El pediatra tambien debera abordar los problemas psicologicos y sociales que puedan derivarse de la EN. EnglishNocturnal enuresis (NE) refers to nocturnal urinary incontinence that occurs at least once a month for three months in children aged five years old or older. NE is more common in males and is usually a primary and monosymptomatic NE. Primary NE is one in which a minimum continence of six months has not been achieved previously. Monosymptomatic NE is not associated with daytime nephro urological symptoms. NE is often associated with comorbidities such as constipation, sleep disorders or ADHD. Genetic predisposition, personal nephro urological history and psychosocial disorders are some of the risk factors for NE in children. Diagnosis is clinical and is based on a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and voiding and drinking diaries. The differential diagnosis is very broad, encompassing other pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, nephro urological diseases, pinworms and neurological disorders. Complementary tests are not routinely indicated if the physical examination is normal and there are not warning signs. Treatment should be individualized and includes health education, motivational therapy, alarm devices, and drugs. Alarm devices are of choice and require patient and family involvement. Desmopressin is preferred in children with less than three wet nights per week, maximum voiding volume during day-time (MVVDT) greater than 75%, age greater than 9 years, or failure of the alarm system. The pediatrician will also need to solve psychological and social problems that may result from NE.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

In the majority of patients causation and course of their erectile disorder is determined by a close interplay of somatic and psychosocial factors. This psychosomatic interaction has to be taken into account during diagnostic assessment and therapy. The old dichotomous concepts (psychogenic versus organic) of erectile dysfunction have to be replaced by multidimensional models that include dispositonal as well as chronifying factors. The main causes of psychogenic erectile disorders can be divided into three groups, each belonging to a different phase of time: 1. immediate factors (performance anxiety), 2. antecedent life events from recent history, 3. developmental vulnerabilities from childhood and adolescence. The most important instrument for the psychological evaluation of sexually dysfunctional patients is a comprehensive sexual history in which partner related aspects should be particularly focused. In treating psychogenic erectile dysfunctions sex therapy is a reliable and efficient treatment option with a reasonably good long-term prognosis. In future, sex therapy should be combined with somatic treatment options to reach a truly integrative approach to this complex disorder.",

      "title": "Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder. The patient gave the authors informed consent to publish this letter.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

Male sexual dysfunction (MSD) encompasses disturbances of libido, erectile function, ejaculation, orgasm, and detumescence, and affects up to 10% of middle-aged or older men. Endocrine disorders should be considered in this context, although non-endocrine factors, particularly psychosexual ones, may be more important. Of all hormonal disorders, diabetes mellitus (DM) is, worldwide, the most common and important cause of organic erectile dysfunction (ED), increasing the risk three-fold compared to men without a history of DM. By comparison, male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from subphysiological testosterone levels due to a perturbation of the HPT axis at one or more levels, is a far less common cause of sexual dysfunction.",

Treatment using a biopsychosocial model must focus on providing the individual with specific techniques designed to help increase feelings of control over-persistent and problematic symptoms. The research reviewed emphasized wide variability in patients' responses to pain and biomedical treatment as a likely outcome predicated by the individual's prior history with pain, their cognitive appraisals and behavioral coping responses, the social milieu in which the pain occurs, and the course of the pain pathophysiology. CP/CPPS should not be viewed from a restrictive biomedical model because pain is not a purely physical phenomenon, but rather a complex physical, emotional, and interpersonal fusion, where the negative outcomes are suggested to advance over time if left unchecked.",

      "title": "The fundamentals of chronic pelvic pain assessment, based on international continence society recommendations",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as a noncyclical pain that has duration of at least 6 months and can lead to decreased quality of life and physical performance. The pain can be attributed to problems in the pelvic organs and/or problems in related systems, and possible psycho‐social attributes may contribute to the manifestation. Due to the complex nature, CPP syndromes are multifactorial and the terminology needs to reflect the setting. Methods The current review is a synthesis of key aspects of the recent International Continence Society Standardization for Terminology in CPP Syndromes. Results Nine domains can be used for a detailed description of CPP. They include four domains specific to the pelvic organs (lower urinary tract, female genital, male genital, gastrointestinal), two related to other sources of pain which may be perceived in the pelvis (musculoskeletal, neurological) and three which may influence the response to the pain or its impact on the individual (psychological, sexual, and comorbidities). For an individual patient with CPP, each domain should be reviewed in terms of symptoms and signs, noting that positive findings could reflect either a primary cause or a secondary consequence. The findings will guide further evaluations and subsequent treatment. Conclusion We present a synthesis of the standard for terminology in CPP syndromes in women and men, which serves as a systematic framework to consider possible sources of pain (pelvic organs or other sources) and the individual responses and impact.",

Although most sex offenders are not mentally ill, many are subject to substance misuse, abnormal personality traits, personality disorder, learning disability or dysphoric mood, and in some organic factors will be involved. Comprehensive assessment of sex offenders includes a full history and mental state evaluation, obtaining a collateral history from other sources, observation, psychometric testing, and psychophysiological methods of assessment, including penile plethysmography. Trials of the use of the polygraph are also under way. The treatment of sex offenders, especially those with paraphilias, may include medication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or anti-libidinal agents. Ethical considerations can be problematic, but a balance can often be found between the welfare of the offender and the safety of the public.",

Furthermore, chronic diseases, chronic pain symptoms, addiction problems as well as recent, psychologically burdening events increase the risk for a depression. If anamnesis or clinical investigation are suggestive for a depression, the patient should be explored systematically with respect to his symptoms. Main symptoms of a depression are depressed mood, loss of enthusiasm and joyfulness as well as depressed motivation and increased fatigability. Further common symptoms are reduced self-confidence, unfounded self-accusations, suicidal thoughts, reduced ability to concentrate, hyperagitation or psychomotor restriction, sleeping disorders as well as loss of appetite.

      "abstract": "Many varieties of psychiatric and psychological treatment have been touted as effective for the paraphilias, which are disorders of sexual behavior requiring unusual or bizarre imagery or acts for sexual excitement. Hormonal alteration of sexual arousal with anti-androgens, particularly Medroxyprogesterone Acetate {MPA), has gained popularity in the last two decades. MPA results in a reversible, dose-dependent reduction in plasma testosterone, with a concomitant reduction in sexual fantasy, arousal, and per formance. Side effects and complications are minimal. Medication is one component in a comprehensive treatment plan which is designed to deal with the patient's medical, social, family, and psychological problems. Implications of the paraphilias and their treatment for the family are discussed. The mental health professional may be confronted at times with sexual problems which have social and legal ramifications as well as clinical ones. Among the most challenging of such sexual problems to treat are the paraphilias. After a referral of the paraphiliac patient to the mental health professional occurs, a decision must be made about what form of treatment can be offered to the patient. Consideration must also be given to prevention of recurrence of the presenting sexual problem. Medroxy progesterone acetate is one possible treatment for the paraphilias which has been gaining in popularity in recent years. Generally there has been little sociological interest in the paraphilias and their treatment despite obvious profound and disruptive effects upon marriage and the family.",

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms and depressive illness are associated with impairments in sexual function and satisfaction but the findings of randomised placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that antidepressant drugs can be associated with the development or worsening of sexual dysfunction. Sexual difficulties during antidepressant treatment often resolve as depression lifts but may persist over long periods, and can reduce self-esteem and affect mood and relationships adversely. Sexual dysfunction during antidepressant treatment is typically associated with many possible causes, but the risk of dysfunction varies with differing antidepressants, and should be considered when selecting an antidepressant.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "title": "Non‐surgical management of erectile dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Male erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to attain and maintain erection of the penis sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse. Desire (sexual interest directed towards the partner), sex drive (the mental state leading to fantasy and sexual behaviour such as masturbation) and the ability to reach orgasm and ejaculatory capacity may all remain intact in the presence of erectile dysfunction. It is important to determine the exact nature of the patient's problem by taking a detailed sex history in a sensitive manner. Recent dramatic advances in therapeutics have transformed public awareness of the problem and brought hope to many patients. The aim of this review is to outline the mechanisms of erectile function and dysfunction, and provide a synopsis of medical management. There are three types of erections: psychogenic, reflexogenic and nocturnal. Psychogenic erections result from visual and auditory stimuli or fantasy and are mediated by cerebral impulses passing through the thoracolumbar and sacral centres to the cavernous nerves. Reflexogenic erections are mediated by afferent impulses from sensory receptors of the skin of the shaft of the penis. Somatic pudendal nerves carry afferent impulses and efferents leave the sacral parasympathetic at the S2–S4 level. Sensory stimulation of the penis is an important component of a reflex arc that helps maintain erection during sexual activity. The mechanism of nocturnal erections occurring during REM sleep is unknown, but they are more sensitive to low androgen levels than psychogenic or reflexogenic erections. The local release of a large number of peptides and catecholamines ( 91; 23; 34; 77; 58) including endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( 2) and, recently, carbon monoxide ( 11) have been implicated in the erectile response. Detumescence is thought to be mediated by sympathetic nerve action associated with adrenaline release which is also responsible for orgasm and ejaculation. Sympathetic activation causes constriction of the trabecular smooth muscle and helicine arteries allowing blood pressure within the cavernosal sinuses of the penis to fall to near venous pressure and the penis to resume its flaccid state. The old classification of erectile dysfunction into organic and psychogenic causes is overly simplistic. The great majority of cases have components of each and, almost irrespective of the cause, management often entails counselling followed by a sequential therapeutic trial of a number of different treatment modalities ( Fig. 1). Erectile dysfunction is positively associated with depression, diabetes (28–59% of men attending diabetic clinics), cardiovascular disease, smoking, increasing age and indices of anger, and is negatively associated with dominant personality traits, dehydroepiandrosterone levels and HDL cholesterol ( 20; 32; 81). While inappropriate to accept erectile dysfunction as a 'natural' consequence of ageing ( 66), it is estimated that no less than 30–40% of men aged 40 years and over have experienced some degree of erectile dysfunction ( 88; 32). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction is high in prolactinoma (70%), adult castration (50–75%), alcoholism (47%), acromegaly (70%), chronic renal failure (46%) and other chronic illnesses. It is also increased by conditions that diminish sexual interest. Flow chart of erectile dysfunction management. Sexual interest is the psychological process underlying sexual desire and initiative that is induced by internal or external erotic stimuli. Loss of sexual desire, a reduction in the intensity and frequency of response to erotic stimuli, is characteristic of profoundly hypogonadal men and women irrespective of whether the problem is primary hypogonadism or secondary hypogonadism. The extent to which loss of sexual desire is responsible for the marked decline in sexual activity with age is not clear, but psychiatric and other intercurrent illnesses, psychological stress, anxiety, tiredness and familiarity or dissatisfaction with a relationship or stereotypic sexual act are frequently implicated ( 4; 55). Erectile dysfunction for many men means a loss of power and control. Information on all treatment options should be made available to the patient (± his partner), and he should be involved in decision-making so that the consultation process does not reaffirm his sense of powerlessness. The purpose of the consultation should be to facilitate potency at all levels. Anticipative and performance anxiety, monotony of sexual intercourse with the same partner, psychic and sexual traumas, impaired communication, female psychosexual dysfunction, the partner's negative reaction to failure and, possibly, high levels of female sexual interest ( 90), contribute to the development and persistence of erectile dysfunction irrespective of other causes. There is good evidence that psychological assessment of sexually dysfunctional patients and psychosexual counselling as an adjunct to physical therapies for erectile dysfunction are useful in selected patients in defined clinical settings ( 42; 100; 54). In some cases this may be just to give a man who is assailed by media pressure 'permission not to have intercourse'. Although intuition draws many to concur with the sentiment that 'the man behind the penis' should be taken into account so that inappropriate treatment does not turn 'a distressed man without an erection into a distressed man with an erection' ( 44), availability of such a service may be limited and the cost–effectiveness of psychosexual counselling in patients with erectile dysfunction of all causes remains to be clearly defined. There are insufficient data as yet to support the assertion that 'in the long run, psychosexual therapy is less expensive than taking sildenafil' ( 44). Serum testosterone levels have to fall to well below the lower end of the normal laboratory range (< 6.7 nmol/l − 2 ng/ml) before nocturnal penile tumescence is impaired ( 40), and sexual interest and the rigidity of erectile response to visual erotic stimuli in hypogonadal men has been shown to be little different to that seen in eugonadal controls ( 39; 49; 16; 15; 17). Several studies, however, suggest that testosterone replacement therapy in relatively modest deficiency states may improve erections in a minority of patients ( 15; 84; 39; 16; 17; 65). It is unclear whether the principle effects of hyperprolactinaemia on erectile dysfunction are mediated centrally by way of reduction in sexual interest and sex drive ( 17) or through a direct effect of prolactin on corpus cavernosum smooth muscle contractility, as appears to be the case in dogs ( 76). In either case, the mechanism is independent of circulating testosterone levels and gonadal axis function ( 85). When prolactin levels are greater than twice the upper limit of normal, treatment of hyperprolactinaemia of any cause with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine can be effective in restoring sexual desire ( 13). Loss of sex drive reduces concern about concurrent erectile dysfunction and as fewer than 1% of patients presenting with the primary complaint of erectile dysfunction have hyperprolactinaemia ( 52; 13), the cost–effectiveness of routine screening for this abnormality has been questioned ( 15). Nitric oxide is the principal mediator of erectile function ( 10). The release of nitric oxide from non-adrenergic–non-cholinergic nerves and endothelial cells of the cavernosal bodies activates guanylyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP induces relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum and increases blood flow to the penis ( 77). By inhibiting cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5, sildenafil reduces cGMP clearance and enhances (but does not initiate) the erectile response to erotic stimuli. Its efficacy depend on the integrity of local nerve supply as a source of nitric oxide. Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and in the fasting state reaches maximal plasma levels after 30–120 min. The drug has an absolute bioavailability of 40% and is cleared predominantly by hepatic metabolism, with pharmacokinetics virtually unchanged by renal function unless creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min. The maximum decrease in supine blood pressure in young, fit subjects within 4 h of an oral dose of sildenafil is approximately 10/7 mmHg and is not dose-related or associated with a change in pulse rate. Sildenafil inhibits type 6 phosphodiesterase isozyme in retinal photoreceptors with 10% of the efficacy of inhibition of type 5. Theoretical problems with visual function through inhibition of this key phototransduction cascade enzyme have not proved troublesome ( 96). Acuity and intra-ocular pressure are unaffected, loss in light sensitivity after a 100-mg dose is similar to the light-absorbing effect of an untinted car windscreen, and transient impairment of red/green colour discrimination requires sensitive tests to detect. The clearance of sildenafil is reduced by erythromycin and cimetidine, which increase circulating levels by 182% and 56%, respectively ( 3). Predictably, as the vasodilatatory effects of nitric oxide donors such as isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate and glyceryl trinitrate are markedly potentiated by sildenafil, co-administration is contraindicated. Patients with organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction are able to achieve satisfactory sexual intercourse in 60–70% of all attempts after oral sildenafil, compared to around 20% of those receiving placebo (Boolell et al., 1996; 38; 71; 26; 62). It is slightly less effective than intracorporeal alprostadil, but significantly less expensive and more practical. As neuronal nitric oxide release is necessary to initiate tumescence, the erectile dysfunction that results from non-nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy is not amenable to sildenafil ( 56; 102; 60). The efficacy of sildenafil in patients with spinal cord injury-induced erectile dysfunction who were able to achieve a partial erection in response to vibratory stimulation ( 24) and in those with prostatic irradiation-induced nerve damage is also quantitatively diminished ( 101), although the same proportion of patients show some response. In a double-blind study of 21 diabetic men aged 42–65 years, roughly half reported that sildenafil significantly increased the number of erections considered sufficiently hard for vaginal penetration ( 75). In a multi-centre, double-blind, flexible-dose study in which 268 diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction for a mean of 5.6 years were randomized to receive sildenafil or placebo, 61% of the 231 patients who completed the study reported at least one successful attempt at intercourse compared to 22% of controls ( 80). There is no increase in the incidence of serious cardiovascular events in diabetic ( 80) or non-diabetic men ( 64) receiving sildenafil. Post-marketing data from 6.4 million prescriptions issued to more than 3.5 million men validates the US Food and Drug Administration's legislative inactivity after receiving reports of 69 sildenafil-associated deaths. Of 130 deaths reported to date, 44 of which were within 5 h of taking a dose, 70% had at least one risk factor for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and three others were found to have severe coronary artery disease at autopsy. These figures do not exceed the death rate from heart disease in an age-matched population with a similar incidence of heart disease and diabetes ( 21; 47). Side-effects reported with a frequency of greater than 2% are rash, diarrhoea, dizziness, abnormal vision, urinary tract infection, nasal congestion, dyspepsia, flushing and headaches. Of these, headache, flushing and dyspepsia are the most common adverse events, but do not lead patients to discontinue treatment ( 38; 41; 64). No cases of priapism were reported in over 2500 patients age range 19–87 years receiving sildenafil in double-blind trials for up to 6 months or in over 2000 patients receiving sildenafil for up to 1 year ( 64). There is concern that concurrent use of sildenafil with nitrate donors may theoretically provoke catastrophic hypotension. The two groups at risk are patients with ischaemic heart disease who have an increased risk of erectile dysfunction and are likely to be prescribed nitrates, and recreational drug users. Approximately 3% of the latter believe that they have consumed sildenafil and used amyl nitrite concurrently ( 1), but experience suggests that up to 80% of black market tablets are counterfeit ( 86). There is insufficient data thus far to know whether the anxiety about this drug combination is well-founded and, if it is, the most appropriate action to take following inadvertent co-administration. The place of yohimbine in therapy for erectile dysfunction has been dismissed by the American Urological Association Clinical Guidelines Panel on Erectile Dysfunction ( 61). Randomized double-blind trials have produced conflicting results ( 63; 78; 92) but larger meta-analyses suggest that patients who received yohimbine obtain significant and useful improvements in symptoms ( 18; 30). Even if only marginally beneficial, yohimbine might still be useful considering its ease of administration and safety in patients who are unwilling to accept other treatments. Other drugs, such as the antidepressant trazodone ( 59; 22), apomorphine ( 43), alpha-adrenergic antagonists either alone ( 6) or to enhance the response of intracavernosal medication ( 103; 48), melanotan-II (a cyclic analogue of alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone) ( 28; 98) and dehydroepiandrosterone ( 79) (plasma levels of which were found to be inversely related to the incidence of erectile dysfunction in the Massachusetts Male Ageing Study: 32), have not been shown to be effective. Application of nitrate creams and combinations of nitrates with aminophylline and codergocrine mesylate to the penile shaft can induce tumescence but have not been shown to enhance the production of erections adequate for vaginal penetration ( 69; 67). Systemic side-effects such as hypotension and headaches are frequent, and contamination of the partner is a potential problem. Newer formulations such as topical PGE1 gel and mixtures of opiates, alpha-blockers and prostaglandins with absorption enhancers, drug carriers or the use of iontophoresis are currently under investigation and may prove safe and useful in the future. The rate and extent of absorption of prostaglandin E1 across the urethral mucosa when delivered as a pellet from a disposable, preloaded catheter (Medicated Urethral System for Erection (MUSE)) is variable. The time between application and erection can therefore differ considerably between patients, such that full erection after a test dose may occur in clinic, in the car park or when the patient reaches home over an hour later. Efficacy is lower than intracavernosal injection and oral sildenafil and side-effects such as urethral pain and discomfort, dizziness, sweating, hypotension and vaginal irritation have been reported ( 73; 74). Nevertheless, serious side-effects such as priapism are rare and, in some series, erections adequate for intercourse were obtained in 66% of applications ( 70; 99). Direct intracavernosal injections of vasoactive agents to treat erectile dysfunction was first described in 1982 using papaverine ( 95), a nitric oxide-independent vasodilator ( 58). Although very effective, papaverine is associated with a significant risk of side-effects such as prolonged erection and penile induration and calcification with long-term use ( 72). Other agents that have been used include alpha-blockers (phentolamine ( 9) and thymoxamine hydrochloride (Moxisylyte) ( 14; 46; 12), nitric oxide donors (linsidomine ( 93) and nitroprusside ( 57)) and peptides (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( 34; 25) and calcitonin-gene-related-peptide ( 19; 27)) either alone or in combination. Prostaglandin E1, the agent now most often used, combines reasonable efficacy with a relatively low risk of side-effects ( 50; 53; 73; 12). Overall, intracavernosal injection therapy consistently produces erections in 60–70% of patients in whom it is tried and in around 50% of diabetics ( 82). Despite the fact that intracavernosal treatment is very effective, many patients dislike self-injection and cannot be motivated to self-inject even if they respond to an injection given in clinic ( 36; 37). Although many claim that their sex lives have improved and 'would recommend the treatment to others' ( 45), of the 70% of responders who enter 'long-term therapy', the drop-out rate is at least 20–50% within the first year and may be as high as 80% in the longer term ( 97; 31; 51). This high drop-out rate probably relates more to fear of injections, local discomfort and lack of spontaneity than to systemic side-effects or the risk of priapism, fibrosis, haemosiderin deposition or haematoma formation, all of which are relatively unusual. Although external vacuum assist devices are able to produce an erection of comparable quality to that produced by intracorporeal injection in some men, overall satisfaction is lower, with a proportion of men achieving 'an erection-like state' but unable to enjoy satisfactory sexual intercourse. Many are disconcerted by either the pivoting nature of the erection or suffer side-effects such as bruising and pain at the site of the constricting rubber ring and penile ischaemia and coldness ( 5; 94; 35; 8; 89). The cost of the appliance for the user is a further disadvantage. In selected patients such as older men and particularly diabetics, in whom erectile dysfunction frequently results from a number of problems including impaired autonomic and endothelium-dependent mechanisms ( 7; 83; 82; 29), vacuum constriction devices potentially offer relatively effective treatment with low morbidity and few recognized complications ( 7; 33). Erectile dysfunction is a common and distressing medical condition that is now highly amenable to treatment almost irrespective of the cause. Safe, non-surgical treatments with unequivocal efficacy are psychological therapy, intracorporeal injection of vasoactive drugs, transurethral vasodilators and oral sildenafil, all of which have been reported to have a 50–70% overall response rate. Vacuum constriction devices are acceptable for some, usually older patients and oral yohimbine is thought to have marginal efficacy. Local creams to induce or enhance erectile function are currently being investigated. There is no place for androgen supplementation unless the patient is profoundly hypogonadal. Treatment of hyperprolactinaemia is very effective but is a rare cause of erectile dysfunction. As intercourse may entail an unfamiliar level of physical activity, it is sensible to ensure that the patient is able to climb a flight or two of stairs comfortably without provoking undue breathlessness or chest pain and to provide suitable advice about technique before commencing treatment. Once it is clear to the patients that erectile dysfunction can be satisfactorily overcome, the long-term use of treatments to do so tends to wane. Thus, although the prospect of effective treatment for what had been for many a distressing life sentence has the potential to place new demands on the health service, there is no evidence that restrictions on prescribing will prove economically rational.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairments in married people under the age of 60 are not common and have received little attention. Using a single case study and drawing on the author’s wide experience of counseling couples in this situation, this paper discusses some of the psychodynamic mechanisms that may come into play when multiple sclerosis (or any other neurological illness) threatens the cognitive capacities of one partner. Normal couple interactions, arising from attachment and affection and important for their maintenance, may be challenged. The author considers some of the problems associated with carers identifying with cognitively-deteriorating partners, including difficulties in thinking. Defenses against recognizing emotionally painful deficits contribute to frustration. Either partner’s lack of conscious awareness or acknowledgment of cognitive deficits and uncertainties as to the origin of troublesome behavior can also cause problems. Cognitive impairments impact on grieving and can give rise to a loss of an internal good object, as well as the loss of normal signals by which carers know they are loved. Also noted is the impact of cognitive problems on sexual relations and on relationships with children and with health professionals. The role of a counselor for a carer in this situation is discussed.",

The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Those with pre-existing mental disorders may experience changes to their symptoms and response to treatment during the perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods and may also be at risk of poorer longer-term physical health outcomes in menopause. The transition towards menopause may be compounded by the oestradiol-suppressing effect of many psychotropics on the hypothalamopituitary–gonadal axis. A collaborative approach between primary care and secondary mental health services is an opportunity for proactive discussion of symptoms and support with management of the perimenopause. This may involve lifestyle measures and/or hormone replacement therapy, which can both lead to improvements in well-being and mental and physical health.",

Although the former group is by far the larger, very little is known about the characteristics of those stalkers. The mentally disordered group comprises mainly those with erotomanic delusions, presenting either as a primary illness or secondary to another mental illness. The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

The socio-professional factors are often much more influential than the physical factors. The overwhelming element of treatment is physical exercise.

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig. Stichworter: Reizdarmsyndrom, viszerale Hypersensitivitat, Psychosomatik, Hirn-Darm-Achse, bauchgerichtete Hypnosetherapie. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives.

There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

Normal emotional functioning might be associate with grief, warm relationship, adequate attention, disease, academic and/or occupational success, impressive events, confrontations, contemplation and maturation, hidden suffering (also as a result of neurobiological determination).",

Sie tritt mit zunehmendem Alter häufiger auf und führt zu einer erhöhten Mortalität, einer verminderten Lebensqualität und verursacht hohe soziökonomische Kosten. Für die Diagnose der POCD stehen keine einheitlichen Testverfahren zur Verfügung. Die Inzidenz wird daher schwankend zwischen 10 und 70 % unmittelbar postoperativ angegeben, allerdings sind in den meisten Fällen nach 12 Monaten keine Einschränkungen mehr nachweisbar. Patienten mit vorbestehender kognitiver Leistungsminderung sind häufiger betroffen. Ein Zusammenhang mit der Entstehung einer Demenz ist aber bisher nicht nachgewiesen. Die pathophysiologischen Mechanismen sind ungeklärt. Anästhetika oder die Art der Narkose haben keinen entscheidenden Einfluss, ebenso ist die Art des operativen Eingriffs eher sekundär. Die kognitive Reserve des einzelnen Patienten scheint aber einen entscheidenden Stellenwert für das Entstehen einer POCD darzustellen. Therapiemöglichkeiten sind bisher nicht bekannt. Möglicherweise könnte die Einführung von körperlichen und geistigen Trainingsprogrammen positiv wirken.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

Circulating androgens are promoters of sex drive and are derived largely from the testes in men and the suprarenal glands in women. A number of endogenous substances regulate libido, which include cortisol, serotonin, oestrogens, dopamine, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, norepinephrine, oxytocin, progesterone, and sex-hormone-binding globulins. Psychological factors can impact on libido, namely, interpersonal relationship, loss of intimacy, stress, fatigue, and bereavement. Other causes include experience of sexual abuse, assault, trauma or neglect, negative body image, and anxiety about engaging in sexual activity. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, reduce sex drive both through biochemical imbalances and the side effects of medications. In cases of low libido, it is important for the woman to describe the problem, including when it first started and how it has developed.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

      "abstract": "The importance of the field of geropsychology (psychology of aging) is seen in the ever-increasing demographics of older adults. A psychologist needs to understand the various life stages that define different cohorts of older adults. Older adults are affected by the forces of stigma and ageism, which are of four types: personal, institutional, intentional, and unintentional. A majority of older adults experience age discrimination and stigmatization after the age of 65. The use of medical model of psychopathology causes contradictions and distortions, one of which is the use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Assessment of deficits in olfactory functioning are potentially useful for a psychologist who is attempting to differentiate between cognitive disturbances of normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sexual interest remains high throughout old adult developmental stages, but sexual activity declines in most men as they age. While older adults are more likely to avoid illicit substances, many older adults having chronic pain from cancer or arthritis need opioid medications. Older adult abuse is a multifactorial phenomenon as the abuse may be emotional, financial, physical, sexual, or self-induced. Environmental geropsychology is based on Lewin's field theory model Lawton and Nahemow's ecological model, and an environmental geropsychologist focuses on the environmental component to develop interventions to change older adults' interpersonal and intrapersonal experiences. Heightened awareness of coming of death results in an existential crisis for many older adults causing a loss of their sense of purpose for their lives.",

      "title": "Sex Hormones and Psychic Conflict a Case Report*",
      "abstract": "The present report has been directed to outlining the factors which influenced the sexual adaptation of a male castrate. The interplay of the treatment situation, reality situation, and inner conflicts, constituted the frames of reference. Intensive psychiatric interviews combined with a relatively lengthy replacement therapy schedule were carried out. In viewing the trajectory of the patient's experiences throughout the observation period, it is evident that during the early periods with androgen there was a definite increase in sexual pace over and above his usual capacity during the last few years, particularly since castration. With the progression of treatment there was a decrease in the effective sexual expression of the patient which required explanation. The following comments are offered in explanation of the mechanisms which underlay the reduction in sexual activity. Following castration, an alteration in the endopsychic conception of the individual takes place. The intensity and extent of this alteration is variable, essentially unconscious, but may also be consciously expressed. The castration may incline the individual to a femininized conception of himself. This is corroborated by the patient's dream material, especially those dreams dealing with the transference. The transference dreams revealed the emergence of a relatively powerful sexual conflict, i.e., the wish to be taken sexually, and also the repudiation of that wish. Since the homosexual conflict is more intense, there will be a concurrent intensification of the patient's hostility toward father-figures, because, by virtue of the homosexual orientation, the patient's passivity is increased. Since passivity is a challenge to the patient's security as well as to the cultural tradition of being virile, it will naturally produce an aggressive response which may or may not be conscious. In this instance, the major display of aggression was seen in the transference dreams and was directed against the physician. The sex hormone pushes the individual into greater sexual activity. It induces him to follow a path more or less consistent with his basic personality patterns in line with the modifications induced by castration. Through the introduction of a more prominent feminine component due to castration, hormonal pressure will intensify the patient's sexual conflicts, i.e., being somewhat more “feminine,” he has a more severe struggle against his passive cravings. He may, therefore, be unable to cope adequately with sexual tension, because of his increased passivity. Thus, we see that after the castration, hormonal treatment may operate eventually to interfere with effective sexuality. It follows that the patient's altered ego attitudes must be worked through before hormones are too freely administered. An effort to analyze carefully the negative transference attitudes was not made in this patient, as, in the main, the psychiatrist took the part of an observer. But, ideally, neglect to analyze such material would appear to be one of the most serious technical oversights for the success of treatment. The next problem is the effect of the wife's illness and her unattractiveness. This may legitimately disturb the patient's heterosexual expression, and since he is married and not completely equipped sexually, the difficulties of an extra-marital affair are quite real. In support of the greater prominence of inner conflict over the external factors, one must realize that the patient, though married, did not hesitate previously to have relationships with women to his own satisfaction, if he wanted them seriously enough. Hence, the weight of evidence tends to throw the balance in the direction of inner conflict and altered ego attitudes. One must also bear in mind that in the last year the patient's attitude toward his wife improved considerably when his own sexual interests became less strong, along with the elimination of the hormone. Thus, although the administration of the male sex hormone temporarily produced a period of sexual rejuvenation, probably capable of repitition, it became evident that the patient's most effective psychic equilibrium was maintained after the discontinuation of hormonal therapy.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

A diagnosis of PMS requires that the symptoms be severe enough to affect a woman's ability to function at home or in the workplace or in her relationships with others. Diagnostic assessment entails a thorough medical and psychiatric history and prospective daily ratings. Disorders such as major depression, anxiety, hypothyroidism, and diabetes must be excluded before a diagnosis of PMS can be considered. Treatment strategies include either eliminating the hormonal cycle associated with ovulation or treating the symptom(s) causing the most distress to the patient. Medical therapies are available for both treatment approaches but should be initiated only after behavioral measures have failed; the physician must also carefully weigh the severity of symptoms against the potential for adverse effects of treatment.",

      "title": "[Infertility: psychological-psychopathological consequences and cognitive-behavioural interventions].",
      "abstract": "Infertility primarily refers to the biological inability of a man or a woman to contribute to conception. Infertility may also refer to the state of a woman who is unable to carry a pregnancy to full term, however other causes can be found in both sexes. The diagnosis of infertility and the concurrent medical treatment are rather stressful events for the couple and can provoke a number of negative symptoms such as depression, anxiety and psychosomatic symptoms which may interfere with the medical therapeutic procedures especially with the in-vitro fertilisation technique. The relationship between infertility and psychological factors has not been explored fully and are still under research. However current findings can be summarized in three basic hypotheses; namely, the effect of psychological factors on the appearance of infertility, the psychological consequences of infertility at the couple, and the reciprocal relation of psychological factors and infertility. Stress and anxiety activate the hypothalamic-adrenal axis (HPA), and this activation can disturb the hormones of fertility. The presence of depressive/anxiety symptoms seems to have a negative impact on the treatment of infertility and sometimes can be a risk factor for lower pregnancy rate. There is a possibility that psychological complaints could develop, prior, during and after the diagnosis of infertility and may interfere with the fertilisation therapy. Should such psychological complaints develop it is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment is used in conjunction with the treatment approach of infertility, e.g. IVF. The above mentioned suggestion is supported by a large number of researchers and current research efforts focus on different psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy. Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has shown during research its superiority compared to other psychotherapeutic interventions and that could be an effective way to decrease the depressive and anxiety symptoms during several stages of the infertility treatment. Moreover Cognitive-Behavioural Group Therapy seems to strengthen the infertile couple's ability to deal with possible changes and the stress during the infertility treatment. It has also been reported in the research community that the use of CBT can improve the pregnancy rate. However, this finding should be viewed with caution due to its insufficient body of evidence and methodological problems incurred.",

This requires assessment of parental objectivity, knowledge of normal development, familiarity with developmental tasks of the period and ability to draw conclusions from observations of the child. II. How disturbed is the child? Here the basic questions are: 1. To what extent are the difficulties reactive to current stress rather than internalized? 2. How serious are the symptoms themselves? Criteria for answering these questions are provided. Comments are made on history-taking and a guide to the clinical examination is presented, together with findings indicating whether the disturbance is mild or serious. Principles for rational intervention are discussed and various treatment options are examined. Methods relatively economical of the physician's time are indicated unless clear reasons for more intensive treatment are present.

Continuous symptomatology, brain matter loss, cognitive deterioration, excess somatic comorbidity, and premature mortality are seen throughout the life span.

It is debatable whether this is related to shared risk factors, antipsychotic medication or inherent to the condition itself.

In the absence of systematic screening this may or may not be brought to the attention of health professionals. The cause of high rates of physical illness appears to be multifactorial involving shared vulnerability and genetic factors. Yet it is vascular risk factors and the adverse effects of prescribed medication that are most amenable to intervention. Current atypical antipsychotics may offer neurological and cognitive benefits, but there is accumulating evidence of problems with weight gain, diabetes, lipid dysregulation, metabolic syndrome and sexual side effects.The physical health of patients with schizophrenia remains a concern. Yet the quality of medical and psychiatric care of patients with comorbid physical and mental health disorders has been shown to be unsatisfactory in several areas.

      "abstract": "Abstract The onset of HD is insidious. Most clinicians refrain from making a diagnosis of either adult or juvenile onset HD until motor signs are present. The motor signs in JHD may differ from those seen in the classical adult form of the condition. Children and young people from HD families may present with behavioural or emotional problems, and a question of whether these are part of the onset of JHD or have an alternative explanation arises. Some families, in this circumstance, have described this as a distressing time as they perceive that professionals are not listening to their concerns, or are even blaming their parenting skills for their child's problems.A problem has arisen because the genetic test is sometimes described as 'diagnostic'. In fact the interpretation of the result depends on the clinical context in which the test was done. If unequivocal neurological abnormalities consistent with HD are present, then an abnormal result is seen as confirming a clinical diagnosis. If an abnormal test result is reported in an asymptomatic person, then the same genetic test is considered to be predictive. The problem comes when a child or young person has problems which may or may not be due to JHD. Unless the test results show an extremely large increase in CAG repeat length, an abnormal result will not resolve that difficulty.Clinicians need to continue to use the genetic test cautiously in children and young people with behavioural and emotional problems alone, but must also be sensitive to the negative perceptions that this may generate for the parent and other carers. At present additional clinical information may be obtained from standard imaging and neuropsychological assessments, and in the future analysis of other biomarkers currently in development may help in the assessment of this clinical problem.",

Although there is little consensus about definition or classification, CSB is generally thought to involve both paraphilic (e.g., pedophilia, voyeurism) and nonparaphilic (e.g., compulsive masturbation) forms. CSB has been estimated to affect as much as 5% of the United States population; 80%-90% of those with CSB are male. Onset occurs in the late teens or early twenties, and the disorder is generally chronic or episodic. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, particularly substance use and mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. Developmental, behavioral, neurobiologic, and sociocultural mechanisms probably play a role in the etiology of CSB and its expression. Treatment has not been well delineated, but individual psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and 12-step programs may be helpful. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help some patients regulate their sexual impulses, while anti-androgens may be helpful in sexually aggressive forms of CSB.",

      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

The first problem is the appropriate duration to determine that the pharmacological treatment is ineffective. The second problem is the criterion for determining the efficacy (or ineffectiveness) of the pharmacological treatment. As far as I know, there is no evidence regarding the duration. Nevertheless, it is necessary to determine the duration. Standards by academic organizations are necessary, even provisional standards are acceptable. Long-term administration of ineffective medicine causes the problem of adverse effects. It loses the opportunity to receive effective treatment. In case that HT is ineffective for menopause, the treatment of fibromyalgia may relieve symptoms of menopause. Patients do not get medical attention for the improvement of abnormal hormone levels but do for the improvement of subjective symptoms such as widespread pain, numbness, insomnia, and fatigue. Some people are almost asymptomatic even if their hormone levels are abnormal. I believe that the efficacy (or ineffectiveness) should be determined with the improvement of the above-mentioned subjective symptoms rather than the improvement of the abnormal hormone levels.",

It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, respiratory disorders, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders seem to be associated with mental disorders; the rates of occurrence, however, depend on the special characteristics of the sample. Utilization of healthcare systems and costs for patients with mental-somatic comorbidities are suggested to be higher than those for patients without comorbidities.Although it is generally accepted that many physical conditions have been associated with serious mental disorders, the exact nature of the relationship between them is still unclear. Various factors such as unhealthy lifestyle habits, psychotropic medication, and inadequate medical treatment or provision are implicated. Further research is required.",

While the primary physiological cause of ED is associated with endocellular degeneration and disorders of neural reflex, its psychological causes are mainly hyposexuality, anxiety and depression. Increasing importance is being attached to the psychological aspects in the diagnosis and management of ED in recent years, and the evaluation questionnaires aimed at the psychosocial significance in ED patients' conditions and psychological interventions solo or combined with drugs have inspired many researches for an optimal solution of the disease. Improvement of the patient's erectile performance is no longer the only outcome we pursue. Instead, the satisfaction of both the patient and his partner has a rising weight in the final evaluation of a therapy. The wide application of PED5 inhibitors and their psychological effect on ED patients makes it necessary for us gain a deeper insight into the combination of psychological intervention and drug therapy in the management of ED.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia is associated with social, economic, and individual burdens, including loss of independence, poor quality of life, and disability. In a short period of time, ideas about sarcopenia transformed from geriatric syndrome to disease. Initially, sarcopenia was considered in the context of gradual age-related deterioration in the functioning of all physiological systems. Over the years, it became clear that it can develop a second time, as a consequence of various diseases and pathological conditions. To date, there have been no generally accepted diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia. There are several tests and tools available for screening sarcopenia, the choice of which depends on physical capabilities of the patient, capabilities of the medical institution, and the purpose for which it is detected (research or clinical practice). From the point of view of human health, sarcopenia increases the risk of falls and fractures; impairs the ability to perform daily activities; is associated with the progression of major diseases and cognitive impairments; leads to movement disorders; contributes to a decrease in the quality of life, loss of independence or a need for long-term care. The presence of sarcopenia increases both the risk of hospitalization and hospitalization costs. The aim of the literature review is to provide an analysis of up-to-date information on the causes, pathogenesis, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and consequences of sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and sarcopenic obesity. The search for literature containing information on relevant studies was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar by the following keywords: sarcopenia, dynapenia, myosteatosis, sarcopenic obesity, nutritional status, malnutrition.",

Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

Women with dyspareunia, in general, suffer negative impacts in psychosocial and sexual areas of their lives [4].

The presence of distress is a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of PGAD, and it is often what leads individuals to seek treatment. Individuals with PGAD often experience a high degree of associated psychosocial impairment. The healthcare experiences of individuals with PGAD appear to share many similarities with what has been reported for other forms of genital discomfort (such as vulvodynia). The etiology of the condition remains unknown. In terms of biological factors, both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system factors have been cited as potential contributors to PGAD.",

En este estudio se describe el comportamiento de los factores farmacológicos y no farmacológicos que alteran la adherencia al tratamiento, de 85 pacientes con esquizofrenia, dados de alta de la Unidad de Salud Mental (USM), del Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo de Neiva (HUHMP), mediante revisión de la historia clínica y la entrevista telefónica del acudiente, familiar o del mismo paciente. La mayoría de los pacientes encuestados son adultos jóvenes, de género masculino, solteros, procedentes del departamento del Huila, con baja escolaridad, sin vinculo laboral en el momento del estudio. Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas.

      "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of as a response to chronic sexual victimisation and considers what this means for services and service configurations, as well as the implications of acknowledging for policy responses in health and human service fields. Abstract: Traumatic events are those that overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life. However, one particular type of is increasingly being recognised as a driver of many social and mental health problems in those affected by it. The repeated caused by ongoing sexual abuse that is prolonged, occurs in the developmental stages of a person's life, and is often perpetrated by an authority figure is now being more readily perceived as a causal feature of multiple social and mental health issues and the consequent need for human services. Although not officially recognised in diagnostic classification, the term complex trauma or complex post-traumatic stress describes a broad-ranging set of disorders, symptoms and social problems that are not captured by a limited diagnostic category of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People suffering need treatments that are multifaceted and varied to accommodate their particular range of symptoms. Isolated treatment of particular symptoms may only impact on one aspect of their needs and will not resolve the underlying issues that have created the problem. Key points: The mental health impacts of sexual victimisation are frequently acknowledged but there are specific and additional impacts where victims have suffered a particular type of abuse that is: interpersonal, commences at an age where emotional development is affected, is ongoing, chronic or features multiple types of abuse. Many researchers and practitioners in the fields of psychiatry, psychology and social work do not see the mental health diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as sufficient to capture these specific effects of multiple types of abuse and chronic victimisation. There have been calls for an additional category called complex PTSD or complex trauma. The impacts of symptomatology on victim/survivors can be a driver of need for many human services, including mental health, medical and substance abuse services as well as social services like housing and relationship services. Acknowledging an underlying basis of could enhance service delivery to the victim/survivor that may have multiple needs across services. It is important to acknowledge the link between ongoing sexual victimisation and in order to facilitate a cultural shift towards the connectedness of services and a person-centred approach to service use.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "any adverse effects the drugs have on memory. However, with a patient’s prolonged exposure to psychotropic drugs, memory impairment unassociated with psychopathology may appear. In some cases, as in depression, the improvement in memory as the emotional disorder resolves may be offset directly by the antimemory effects caused by continued use of the drug. Because of the effects emotional illness has on cognitive function, normal volunteers are often used in clinical research investigating the effects of psychotropic drugs on memory. This means that drugs are tested in a single dose, or at most a few doses, rather than being administered for months or years as in the clinical situation. Drug testing in normal volunteers, therefore, may not detect longterm psychotropic drug effects on memory. Although the research data are",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Deep dyspareunia refers to pain with deep penetration or insertion into the vagina, which affects quality of life. The aim of this narrative review was to examine how the underlying conditions that give rise to deep dyspareunia, and the symptoms of these conditions, can affect sexual function and quality of life beyond the deep dyspareunia itself. For example, deep dyspareunia may be associated with gynecological pathologies that cause cyclical pain symptoms (e.g. dysmenorrhea, dyschezia/dysuria), resulting in quality of life changes related to menstrual cycle events such as ovulation or menstruation. Recurrent dysmenorrhea can cause hyperalgesic priming that sensitizes the nervous system, leading to chronic pelvic pain that can be exacerbated with sexual activity. The coexistence of functional bowel or bladder disorders can result in urgency and frequency that affect the sexual response cycle. Myofascial/musculoskeletal origins of deep dyspareunia may affect body positioning during sexual activity. Central nervous system sensitization can underlie these different factors, and also be associated with mental health conditions, which together can cause symptomatology across body systems that can affect all aspects of one's sexual life. Recognition and management of the far-reaching impacts of deep dyspareunia and its associated comorbidities may be important in clinical care to meaningfully improve quality of life. Future research should include a comprehensive empirical validation of the hypotheses and potential mechanisms in this review.",

Three systems of organs are involved in the male sexual act, and a disorder in any one of them may prevent its successful completion. The function of the nervous system is most important, particularly in the psychic sphere. While organic lesions of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves may produce impotence, the latter is usually so overshadowed by other manifestations as to make it incidental. One may summarise the position of the endocrine system by saying that the anterior lobe of the pituitary governs the development and function of the testes which, in turn, control the development and function of the sex characters and accessory sex organs. Thus a reduction in the function of either anterior pituitary or testes will reduce or abolish potency. Impotence due to such disturbances is readily recognised.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "abstract": "textabstractBipolar disorder (also called manic-depressive illness) is one of the major mood disorders. The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "It is well recognised that patients attending infertility clinics generally experience feelings of frustration and inadequacy, and frequently display signs of emotional distress. Historically, childlessness has always been recognised as a problem, whether as a misfortune or even as an offence (Carr 1963). Likewise, it has long been suspected that infertility may, in some cases, have a psychogenic basis. The question of the relationship between psychological variables and infertility is nevertheless a complex one, and the literature, although extensive, is speculative, anecdotal and contradictory. Few studies meet adequate methodological standards. Nevertheless, any consideration of the relevance of psychological factors to infertility management must address the question of psychogenic infertility.",

This kind of upset has the potential to cause worry and anxiety, which have a significant impact on patients, their partners and their relationships. Women have a wide variety of responses when dealing with their own vulval pathology, which can range from apathy, ignoring neoplastic lesions for many years, to great anxiety about mild and benign symptoms. During the consultation with a patient with vulval symptoms, the physician should take note of nonverbal signs exhibited by the patient, which may indicate anxiety or other psychological issues. Questions about sexual satisfaction and desire can give valuable information and this could lead to the discovery of personal unresolved problems such as conflicts with the partner or preconceptions about their problem.",

The disease is often manifested as perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Positive symptoms refer to abnormal or hyperactive mental functions, including abnormal sensations (visual and auditory hallucinations), delusions, confused thoughts, disorganized speech and behavior, etc. Negative symptoms refer to reduced or absent mental functions, including lack of motivation, lack of pleasure, social withdrawal, reduced willpower, etc. Cognitive deficits include impaired attention, decline in executive function and working memory, etc. Although the use of chlorpromazine in 1950 cured or alleviated the psychiatric symptoms of most SCZ patients, there were still 20% of the patients who were drug-resistant or dissatisfied with psychotropic treatments. So far, SCZ treatment mainly includes medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychotherapy, and rTMS treatment.",

Symptoms associated with it may precede or follow the menopause, which is a single event during the climacteric, and they are therefore better called climacteric rather than menopausal symptoms. They include hot flushes; depression or emotional instability , sometimes with insomnia as the most prominent feature; and dyspareunia . Changes in libido apart from dyspareunia are often of psychological origin and are probably caused as much by ageing as by a fall in oestrogen production.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

The somaticizing process is believed to be an expression of emotional distress. The most common complaints of SD patients include recurrent pain (site and quality vary), conversion (pseudoneurologic) symptoms, nervousness or depression (or both), sexual and marital discord, and, often, menstrual difficulties. Such patients will generally have a history of repeated hospitalization or surgery. These symptoms are not perceived as mild or unimportant but lead to physician consultation, prescription drug use, and modification of life-style. Such patients are prone to \"doctor-shopping\" and self-medication and are at risk for many iatrogenic illnesses. Because they generally are resistant to psychologic explanations for their condition, management aimed at protecting them from the consequences of their behavior is important. A heightened threshold for instituting aggressive diagnostic and treatment procedures is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction and Associated Psychiatric Comorbidities Impacting Quality of Life in Epilepsy: A Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Epilepsy is caused by dysfunction in the brain, which is characterized by an enduring disposition for unprovoked seizures that reoccur often, along with the neurological, cognitive, psychological, and social effects of the condition, which are often managed with prolonged and sometimes lifelong medications that involve antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). To confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy, at least two unprovoked seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart should be reported. This illness affects both children and adults. Patients with epilepsy are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction compared to the general population, which often leads to a poor quality of life. The pathophysiology involved consists of the impact of epilepsy and AEDs on the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, consequently resulting in a high risk of developing testicular or ovarian dysfunction, leading to sexual dysfunction in epilepsy patients. Aim: This review aims to highlight various studies focusing on the association of developing the risk of sexual dysfunction with psychiatric comorbidities, mainly depression and anxiety, that impact the quality of life in epilepsy patients. Methodology: The search methodology involved articles from the Google Scholar and PubMed databases published between 2018 and 2023. \"Sexual dysfunction\", \"epilepsy\", \"depression\", \"anxiety\", and \"quality of life\" were the keywords used to search the articles. The Boolean operator \"AND\" and \"OR\" were used in between the keywords used. Following this, a total of 15 articles were included in the review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conclusion: The review concluded that epilepsy patients are often affected by sexual dysfunction along with associated psychiatric comorbidities that mainly involve depression and anxiety, consequently impacting their quality of life, as demonstrated by various studies. Sexual dysfunction is a common yet underdiagnosed condition in epilepsy patients due to the stigma attached to it. Hence, neurologists must keep a high index of suspicion for this problem. Furthermore, screening and monitoring for sexual dysfunction should be added to the usual epilepsy work-up.",

Furthermore, a variety of factors related to characteristics of the griever, the nature of the loss, and available support may influence grief processes and health outcomes. When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes.

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

Being bedfast with poor caretaker relationships and being socially isolated are risk factors for psychosis among elderly persons. A thorough history is essential to differential diagnosis. Psychiatric causes to be ruled out include schizophrenia; depression, including mania; dementia and delirium; paranoid state; and late-life delusional disorder. Perhaps the most common etiology is cognitive impairment, generally attributable to Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia. Organic or toxic etiologies need to be ruled out, especially in persons with visual hallucinations. Drug toxicity, a structural brain lesion, or a subtle seizure disorder should be considered. If symptoms are not alleviated when psychosocial triggers or underlying toxic, organic, or medical causes are addressed, patients may respond to supportive therapy and low doses of high-potency neuroleptics. The clinician should keep in mind that older adults are highly sensitive to the side effects of these agents.",

      "title": "Clumsy Child",
      "abstract": "It has been estimated that 6% to 7% of school-aged children manifest poor coordination.1 Clinicians will rarely identify the presence of this type of disability from their findings during routine physical and neurologic examinations. What is required is careful observation of the child during performance of fine and gross developmental motor tasks. It is infrequent that parents will express concern to the pediatrician, unless they have clues from nursery school or grade school teachers, coaches, peers, or, occasionally, from the child him- or herself. The child is usually the first one to be aware of motor limitations, especially when he or she is in competition with children of the same age. Unfortunately, the child does not usually verbalize his or her concern but will refrain from participating in competitive motor activities to conceal motor inadequacies. DEFINITION The term \"clumsy child\" refers to a boy or girl who performs fine and/or gross motor tasks in an immature, disorganized, erratic, slow, irregular, or inconsistent fashion. The relevant motor skills are imprecise rather than grossly impaired and the neurologic examination does not reveal significant postural disabilities or involuntary movements. SIGNIFICANCE A pediatrician should not minimize the significance of clumsiness. It is frequently associated with other evidence of cerebral dysfunction, such as cognitive and/or perceptual impairments that may result in learning disabilities.",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

Typically, compulsive sexual behaviors are characterized by the failure to resist the urge for a given sexual behavior, which is frequently followed by feelings of guilt, regret, and self-reproach, leading to their inclusion in the spectrum of impulse control disorders. The treatment of compulsive sexual behaviors is challenging, with reports of varying success for several psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

      "abstract": "Psychische Schaeden als Unfallfolgen fuehren oft zum Rechtsstreit. Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben. Bei den Stoerungsbildern dissoziative Bewegungsstoerungen und somative Stoerungen koennen durch den Untersucher keine krankhaften Befunde, bei der traumatischen Belastungsstoerung nur spaerliche Befunde erhoben werden.

      "abstract": "The inability to achieve and maintain a penile erection during sexual activity is a devastating male sexual disorder termed as erectile dysfunction (ED) that affects the psychosocial status of men irrespective of their age. The disease might be of psychogenic or organic origin but the psychological and social burden of the disease is enormous. This factor has kept the disease under-reported and undiagnosed in most of the cases. However, recent awareness and sensitization have encouraged people to discuss the disease and seek clinical help. The diagnosis of ED relies mostly on analyzing patients' clinical and psychological history than laboratory-based diagnostic tests. In most cases, a questionnaire-based survey is taken to understand the psychological and sexual activity status of the patient. With the advent of modern pharmacotherapy and other invasive procedures, ED has become a manageable disease. The treatment regime may include endocrine therapy, shockwave therapy and in some cases can even require penile prosthesis surgery depending on the extent and severity of the disease. However, lifestyle modification and psychological counseling remain a common support for all patients suffering from ED. An in-depth understanding of the pathophysiology and psychosomatic pattern of erectile dysfunction can help both the patient and the clinician to deal with this disorder and evolve with better options for the management of the disease in future.",

The lack of passion—which, at best, appears dampened, intellectualized, obsessive, or dissociated—is what characterizes latency-age functioning, regardless of the patient's age. The calm and obsessiveness of latency can be disrupted by external events that provoke some curiosity about sexual life, quite different from the scant and lack-lustre genital encounters of their marriages. The lethargy and obsessiveness of latency were shaken after several years when she learned that her best friend was having an extramarital love affair. Further developments in meta-psychological understanding are needed to answer the question about whether there exists an isomorphism between the developmental infant latency and the psychopathology of protracted latency in adult patients.",

Chronic non-specific low back pain is defined as back pain persisting for more than 6 weeks in the absence of an underlying pathology. Multiple different permutations of the structures in the back, such as joints, discs, muscles, tendons and ligaments, play a part in the development of chronic non-specific low back pain. With the right management, low back pain resolves or improves significantly in the majority of cases.

A diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, or recurrent severe depressive illness, is, at best, a lifelong vulnerability and, at worst, a continuous chronic condition with serious associated disabilities. Like many physical chronic diseases, such an illness demands of the individual and those closest to them acceptance of a highly unpalatable diagnosis, adjustments in lifestyle and life expectations, and the often unwelcome realities of long-term treatment and service involvement— if relapse and long-term disability are to be minimized. As with other chronic diseases, the organization of care needs to include a greater emphasis on certain key elements.",

      "title": "Doctor patient communication Content or process",
      "abstract": "In the doctor-patient interview, there is a tendency to think of a dichotomy between content or background (the patient's complaint, his symptoms, medical decision-making subject to evidence -evidence-based medicine (EBM)-, drug prescription, etc.) and the process or form of the interview (the modality of the doctor-patient relationship, empathy/assertiveness, sympathy, compassion, transference and countertransference, the placebo effect, etc.). This approach is as reductionist as the usual mind-body dualism. And the problem is that, as in the bio-psychosocial (BPS) approach, the holistic content-process approach to doctor-patient communication has not been integrated into the daily practice of general practitioners (GPs) with little time, who care for most patients with acute and chronic, physical and mental illnesses [1, 2]. General Medicine (GM) presents special characteristics that differentiate it from other medical specialties. In GM it is necessary to evaluate the presentation of symptoms, in addition to the symptoms themselves. That is, the reason for the consultation initiates or emphasizes important issues for the pat ient, and not just symptoms, in a communication context [3, 4]. GPs often assume that in consultation the patient will ment ion the most important symptoms and signs in relation to it, and that patients will spontaneously report all their fears and worries; neither of these assumptions is true (5). When a pat ient comes to the office, the GP must face a certain amount of uncertainty about the evaluation and optimal treatment of it. Uncertainty is frequently represented in terms of probability or normative reasoning, and EBM. But, the reason for consultation expressed by the patient is only a manifest content. The GP must transform or complete those ideas that are latent or initially hidden [6, 7]. Symptoms are often \"disorganized\", not readily recognizable, and can be presented by symbols, as does the arrangement of notes in a musical score. Perhaps the family doctor has to approach the symptoms as if they were \"music\": like a mysterious constellation; seeking order in disorder, or better trying to understand some of the disorder [8]. The symptom is an indicator of a process that is not always fully visible. The loss of internal balance manifests itself in the body in the form of a symptom. In addition, the symptom is not an enemy whose destruction should be the main objective, but can be an ally to find the disease. In reality, the symptom indicates what the patient “misses” (9). The GP try of knowing the latent material by means of “reading the patient’s manifest signs and symbols”. The messages of our patients contain “facts” and “feelings”, and we must be attent ive and understand the emotional messages. The reason for consultation / symptom / manifest problem that the patient initially expresses is a “symbolic representation” (with universal and particular symbols); and in addition, the doctor looks for what seems to be the cause of the patient's problem in the doctor-patient relationship itself [10]. The process of communication or presentation of the reason for the visit that the patient makes to the doctor is itself a content of the health problem, it gives information about the psychic life, and it can be a signal that tells the doctor which direction to take [11-13]. In order to fully understand the symptom we must distance ourselves from the usual valuations. It is convenient to replace an excessively analytical and rational thought, with another plastic, symbolic and analogical one. Illness is a system of interpretation; and to understand disease we have to see a system of relationships. The emotional response expressed by the patient has the effect of a linguistic transfer from social complexity to psychic complexity. Illness is expressed as a contrast –not as its own unequivocal entity, but as a contrast between relationship systems-, as in painting a contour, a line, appears from the contrast between two colours instead of how a line is actually drawn [14].",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

Symptoms during the last year of life in older persons are often a combination of the underlying life-threatening illness and other chronic conditions. These may be complicated by psychosocial and spiritual needs, related to life events such as bereavement. Geriatric palliative medicine involves the care and management of older patients’ progressive advanced disease, for whom the aim is quality of life. It focuses on detailed geriatric assessment, relief from pain and other symptoms such as anorexia, constipation, or delirium, and also management of psychological problems including depression or anxiety. This may be more challenging in people with cognitive impairment who may not be able to express whether they are in pain or otherwise suffering. Adequate pain and symptom management at the end of life emphasizes the need for a tailored multidisciplinary approach for patients and their family.",

      "title": "How does multiple trauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI) affect male sexual functioning?",
      "abstract": "Sex is an important part of life for many people, therefore dealing with erectile problems, living with the effects of physical injury, changes in your appearance or side-effects of treatment can have an enormous impact on your sex life and relationships. Normal sexual behaviour and erectile function depends on a complex interaction between various body-systems, including the brain, nerves, blood-supply and hormones. All of these systems (alone or in combination) may be affected following multiple trauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI). For men, trauma may result in problems with achieving or maintaining erections (commonly referred to as erectile dysfunction; ED), problems with ejaculation, or how they think/feel about sex - all of these problems may have an indirect, if not profound impact on long-term functional recovery and overall quality of life. Following multiple trauma, spinal injury, or TBI, it is not unusual for some men to go through a period of reduced sexual drive (reduced libido). Apart from physical effects of injury, the way the body responds sexually also depends on thoughts and feelings – thoughts and feelings about yourself and others may be influenced by changes in mood, motivation, personality and thought-processes. This may be complicated by depression, emotional trauma following the injury, medication, or changes in hormone levels. As some men grapple with the changes and implications associated with their injury, many may initially ignore the importance of sexual difficulties, as they remain focused on physical rehabilitation and recovery of mobility. Other men may be reluctant to acknowledge sexual difficulties, due to cultural or personal reasons. There are a wide range of treatments and interventions that may be helpful for the man and his partner, which is why assessment of sexual function should be routinely incorporated into rehabilitation and follow-up services for trauma-survivors. The information below describes common sexual problems after TBI, SCI or multiple trauma and ways to improve sexual functioning.",

      "abstract": "Ejaculatory/orgasmic disorders are common male sexual dysfunctions, and include premature ejaculation (PE), inhibited ejaculation, anejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, and anorgasmia.Premature ejaculation management is largely dependent upon aetiology. Life-long PE is best managed with PE pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor [SSRI] and/or topical anaesthetics). The management of acquired PE is aetiology-specific and may include erectile dysfunction (ED) pharmacotherapy in men with co-morbid ED. Behavioural therapy is indicated when psychogenic or relationship factors are present and is often best combined with PE pharmacotherapy in an integrated treatment programme. Delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, and/or anorgasmia may have a biogenic and/or psychogenic aetiology. Men with age-related penile hypoanesthesia should be educated, reassured, and instructed in revised sexual techniques which maximize arousal. No drugs have yet been approved by regulatory agencies for this purpose, and most drugs identified for potential use have limited efficacy, impart significant side effects, or are considered experimental in nature.",

Patients often suffer from mental pain due to concerns about recurrence, treatment-related side-effect, and body image changes. Demographic factors like age, gender, physiological factors such as somatic symptoms and disease stage, cognitive-regulatory factors including negative and positive thinking, and social factors like work, economy, education level, and social support all influence their mental state. Existing interventions, including nursing, psychological, and traditional Chinese medicine-based methods, have some benefits but face limitations like short-term effectiveness and lack of standardization. Future research should focus on creating better-defined, long-term, and widely applicable intervention programs and explore positive psychology-based approaches to improve patients' mental well-being and quality of life.",

      "title": "Management of ejaculatory dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Ejaculatory dysfunction is a common complaint and is often associated with a reduced quality of life for sufferer and partner. The spectrum of ejaculatory dysfunction extends from premature ejaculation ( PE ) to delayed ejaculation ( DE ) and anejaculation. Over the past 20–30 years, the PE treatment paradigm, previously limited to behavioural psychotherapy, has expanded to include drug treatment. Multiple well‐controlled, evidence‐based studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors in delaying ejaculation, confirming their role as first‐line agents for the treatment of lifelong and acquired PE . More recently, there has been increased attention to the psychosocial consequences of PE , its epidemiology, its aetiology and its pathophysiology by both clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry. DE and anejaculation are probably the least common, least studied and least understood of the male sexual dysfunctions. However, their impact is significant as they may result in a lack of sexual fulfilment for both the man and his partner, an effect further compounded when procreation is among the couple's goals of sexual intercourse. The causes of DE , anejaculation and anorgasmia are manifold. Numerous psychotherapeutic treatments are described for the management of delayed or anejaculation. Although some appear to be effective, none has been properly evaluated in large‐scale samples. Treatment of DE or anejaculation with pharmacotherapy has met with limited success. No drugs have been approved by regulatory agencies for this purpose, and most drugs that have been identified for potential use have limited efficacy, impart significant side‐effects or are yet considered experimental in nature.",

There was no relation between the clinicians’ diagnoses of depression and psychometric scores. Little relation was found between performance on the cognitive tests and the number of depressive features (maximum, 9) reported by the individual or collateral source.

It has been shown to predict the course of neurotic depression [6], major depressive disorder [9], and bipolar disorder [1 1], and treatment dropout among patients with anorexia nervosa [12]. We do not know, however, whether high EE in the family is a cause or a result of relapsing mental illness. In spite of the body of research establishing its predictive validity among psychiatric populations, the meaning of the EE construct remains elusive [2].

More are acutely neurotic, and their acts may be seen as manipulative gestures, or cries for help, or acting-out maneuvers. A large portion have disordered personalities and faulty character structures, often with alcoholism, narcotic addiction, sexual psychopathy, passive-aggressive disturbance, or emotional immaturity, instability, or inadequacy.

      "abstract": "Abstract Erectile and other sexual dysfunctions are relatively common in the general population. The prevalence of sexual problems increases with age and is higher in populations with medical or psychiatric illness than in the general population. Sexual dysfunction which is presumed to be drug related must be assessed against this background prevalence. Drug treatment can be associated with non-specific effects on sexual function, for example due to anxiety produced by medical diagnosis and treatment. Side-effects such as sedation can lead to a general non-specific lowering of interest and drive, including libido. Conversely, sexual dysfunction associated with illness can in some cases be improved by successful drug treatment of that illness. It follows that anecdotal reports of sexual effects from medication in individual patients are highly unreliable. The effect of drugs on sexual function can be assessed only in the setting of a randomized placebo-controlled trial with careful psychosexual assessment. Unfortunately, virtually all medication trials depend on self-reporting of sexual side-effects and this is very unreliable. There is thus a serious dearth of adequate research in this field, and the present chapter must be set in that context.",

Drugs, especially psychotropic drugs, act on symptoms and change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; they can create both physical and psychological dependency; they can discourage a deep search for real solutions, both on the part of the doctor and the patient; they can affect the doctor’s access to the patient and the problem will be out of their reach. Psychotropic drugs can make the effect of the doctor in himself as a drug more difficult, favor an insignificant or problematic or little human relational context, where the GP/psychiatrist does not delve into the true meaning of the symptoms, and the patient tends not to get involved, to make an emotional withdrawal, to be passive before the prescribed drug, and can result in the chronification and structuring of functional symptoms that become organic, with lack of cooperation of the doctor and the patient, and paradoxically with over-compliance or therapeutic discontinuity and the lack of pharmacological adherence, absences to appointments or delays or cancellations of visits, and the denial of responsibility of both the doctor and the patient.",

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

      "title": "Genetic Principles in the Classification of Affective Illnesses",
      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

      "abstract": "Etwa 5 bis 10% der erwachsenen Bevölkerung geben an, sich ziemlich häufig bis sehr häufig einsam zu fühlen. Darüber hinaus ist Einsamkeit ein Phänomen, welches im klinischen Alltag häufig anzutreffen ist, auch wenn es von Patientinnen und Patienten nicht immer spontan berichtet wird. Das aversive Gefühl der Einsamkeit tritt auf, wenn unser menschliches Grundbedürfnis nach sozialen Beziehungen nicht genügend befriedigt ist. Es zeigt sich bei Betroffenen, die über zu wenige oder qualitativ nicht ausreichend befriedigende Kontakte verfügen. Es ist wichtig, zwischen vorübergehender, situativer und überdauernder Einsamkeit zu unterscheiden. Denn obwohl jede Art von Einsamkeit schmerzhaft ist, ist Einsamkeit nicht immer dysfunktional. Während vorübergehenden und situativ bedingten Einsamkeitsgefühlen in der Regel eine adaptive Funktion zugeschrieben wird, sind überdauernde Einsamkeitsgefühle mit einem hohen Leidensdruck und einer Vielzahl von psychischen und somatischen Beschwerden assoziiert. Überdauernde Einsamkeitsgefühle spielen bei der Entstehung und/oder Aufrechterhaltung verschiedener psychischer Störungen eine zentrale Rolle. Der Band sensibilisiert Fachpersonen für das Thema Einsamkeit, fasst den aktuellen Stand zur Phänomenologie und Verbreitung von Einsamkeit zusammen und nennt verschiedene Risikofaktoren für die Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung von Einsamkeit. Zudem werden empirische Zusammenhänge von Einsamkeit mit psychischen und somatischen Störungen sowie klinischen Phänomenen wie Suizidalität berichtet. Der Band stellt verschiedene Erklärungsmodelle vor und beschreibt spezifische, darauf aufbauende Interventionsmöglichkeiten. Diese sollen Fachpersonen beim Umgang mit dem Thema Einsamkeit in der Therapie unterstützen und eine auf die individuellen Umstände einer Person abgestimmte Therapie ermöglichen.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

      "abstract": "El término chemsex describe el uso intencionado de drogas para facilitar o prolongar encuentros sexuales entre gais, bisexuales y otros hombres que tienen sexo con hombres (GBHSH). Las sustancias comúnmente implicadas, como la metanfetamina, el gamma hidroxibutirato (GHB)/gamma-butirolactona (GBL) y la mefedrona, son utilizadas para intensificar la experiencia sexual, desinhibir y prolongar la duración del acto. Este fenómeno ha ganado visibilidad en los últimos años debido a sus implicaciones para la salud pública, que van desde la transmisión de infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS) hasta trastornos psicológicos y dependencia a las drogas. El chemsex no solo tiene un impacto sobre la salud física, sino también sobre la salud mental al estar asociado a problemas como la ansiedad, la depresión y el aislamiento social. Las características particulares de esta práctica hacen que los profesionales de la salud, en especial en Atención Primaria (AP), enfrenten desafíos tanto en el diagnóstico como en el manejo adecuado de estas personas. Es crucial que el personal médico de AP se prepare para reconocer este fenómeno y proporcionar una atención no estigmatizante, dada la posible reticencia de los pacientes a exponer sus comportamientos sexuales y el uso de sustancias. En este artículo de revisión, se explorarán aspectos clave del chemsex, incluyendo su contexto sociocultural, la epidemiología en España, las principales sustancias utilizadas y las pautas de diagnóstico y manejo en AP. Además, se abordará la necesidad de una estrecha coordinación entre distintos niveles asistenciales para proporcionar una atención integral y eficaz a este tipo de pacientes. La creciente prevalencia del chemsex subraya la urgencia de mejorar la formación médica y las estrategias de salud pública que aborden tanto los riesgos asociados como la prevención.

Its etiology is still unclear, and the clinical presentation is quite heterogeneous, manifesting itself through obsessions and/or compulsions that are associated with high levels of anxiety and time consumption. Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities. Conclusion It is essential to implement strategies for effective communication between both medical specialities, and aim to prevent occupational risks, by protecting and promoting healthy workplaces.

      "abstract": "Many men experience sexual function disorders, the most common of which are PE and ED. However, they may hesitate to seek treatment because of the perceived embarrassment associated with discussing their symptoms with a physician. The introduction of PDE-5 inhibitors for the treatment of ED has resulted in increased awareness of men's sexual health; as a result, men may be more willing to discuss their symptoms of sexual dysfunction because they are aware that treatment options are available. An accurate diagnosis is important for effective treatment of sexual dysfunctions and depends on a detailed description of patient symptoms along with a complete sexual history. When forming a diagnosis, physicians must distinguish PE from ED and other sexual dysfunctions. To diagnose PE, a physician should incorporate measures that include personal distress and interpersonal difficulty between the patient and his partner. Premature ejaculation affects many men, and current pharmacologic treatment options are limited to off-label use of medications indicated for the treatment of depression or the distinct sexual dysfunction, ED. Therefore, the development of new pharmacologic treatments for PE is warranted.",

La contenzione fisica, come implica la definizione, sono le modalita che limitano i movimenti dell’ospite e non possono essere da lui facilmente rimossi. Si ha la contenzione chimica, quando farmaci tranquillanti, sedativi e antidepressivi sono usati senza indicazioni adeguate o per periodi eccessivi di tempo. Nelle istituzioni geriatriche il ricorso al loro uso sembra essere eccessivo, gli ospiti anziani sono spesso in contenzione senza una chiara direttiva medica e per motivazioni non sempre corrette. Da un esame della letteratura e dell’esperienza clinica, gli Autori evidenziano come i mezzi di contenzione non solo non raggiungono quei risultati previsti nelle motivazioni addotte per il loro uso, ma possono comportare effetti collaterali dannosi quale la diminuzione del tono muscolare, ulcere da pressione, disturbi circolari, e anche la morte. Da un punto di vista etico legare l’ospite anziano assume costantemente connotazioni negative e suggerisce sempre privazioni di autonomia, annullamento della persona. Se e quando la contenzione deve essere adottata, questo deve avvenire dopo che si siano esaminati tutti gli interventi alternativi possibili, e deve essere sempre prescritta da un medico ed accuratamente registrata sia per la modalita usata la meno coercitiva possibile che per il tempo che si rende necessaria. Se ne dovrebbero considerare le indicazioni, le controindicazioni, l’efficacia e la sicurezza, gli effetti indesiderati esattamente come si fa con un farmaco o con un\r\nintervento chirurgico. Una politica di riduzione al ricorso generalizzato ai mezzi di contenzione deve essere considerata nell’ambito di una prospettiva assistenziale che favorisca una migliore formazione degli operatori, e tenga conto di fattori clinici, fattori spirituali e psicosociali, fattori riabilitativi, fattori ambientali.",

This question has arisen repeatedly over the years, in part because of the apparent correspondence between the illnesses of depression and mania on the one hand, and the emotions of sadness and elation on the other. The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events. Making this assumption, physicians and patients alike often seek a causal connection between stressful events and sustained affective disorder. In an individual case it is impossible to prove or",

      "abstract": "초록·키워드 목차 오류제보하기 Muzong in Liao Dynasty suffered from borderline personality disorder due to various negative environmental factors during the growth process and after the emperor\"s ascension, and schizophrenia was more pronounced in his later years in office. Mokjong was so capricious that he got angry or brutally slaughtered the Valets (近侍). In addition, drinking too much and sleeping resulted in more days of not attending the meeting, and officials were appointed in a drunken state. As a result, the political situation became unstable due to the lack of administrative efficiency and the loss of national territory by passive response in foreign relations. He shows a psychopathic phenomenon called borderline personality disorder. A person with borderline personality disorder experiences a sense of confusion about himself, showing various protruding behaviors that are hard to predict because stable self-image has not been established. He was self-indulgent and self-indulgent, war, and sexual dysfunction, depending on alcohol, but he was more drunk and destroyed himself in a vicious cycle of shame and guilt caused by moral anxiety. Eventually, he is killed by people who serves close (近侍) who were subject to murder. As such, the impact of a human growth process on an individual is absolute. Abnormal behavior and mental disorder are the products of such painful and unhappy past experiences, as well as the causes that make life painful and unhappy. This could bring misfortune to society and the nation, not only to the parties but also to their families and people around them. In particular, it was inevitable that the absolute monarch of feudal society would fall in national power and endanger the country, as he was acting strangely due to psychological disorder, wrong decision-making, and disorderly conduct, so that his subjects could not control the monarch. #요 목종 #수왕 #근시 살해 #정신분석 #경계선성격장애 #遼 穆宗 #睡王 #近侍殺害 #情神分析 #境界線性格障礙 #Muzong emperor in Liao Dynasty #sleeping king #slaughter of Valets #psychoanalysis #borderline personality disorder Ⅰ. 머리말Ⅱ. 목종의 가계도 및 그 생애Ⅲ. 목종의 이상행동과 그 원인Ⅳ. 맺음말참고문헌Abstract",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "title": "The evolution of early psychosis with variable expression. Study of a clinical case",
      "abstract": "It is the study of a clinical observation, over a period of two years, of a 21-year-old man who often presented himself at the emergency room for severe anxiety and behavioral disorders characterized by repeated self-mutilation, psychomotor agitation, homicidal behavior toward his father, aggressive impulsivity, and sometimes antisocial behavior (running away and dangerousness). Ideas of persecution and reference often underlay his disordered behaviors. The patient also made frequent suicide attempts related to brief depressive periods, in which he verbalized great suffering that he explained by family relational difficulties and traumatic events (parental abuse, accidents). After two years, the clinical picture was aggravated by the appearance of symptoms of schizophrenia comprising paranoid delusion, hallucinations with mental automatism, social withdrawal, and affective and behavioral disorganization that had completely replaced his self-aggressive acting-out. These polymorphic symptoms initially posed a diagnostic and therapeutic problem for psychiatrists due to their persistence and repetition; these were made more complex by the sexual and identity problems that were later revealed through psychotherapeutic observation.The observation consisted of attentive listening during regular psychotherapeutic interviews that allowed to retrace the evolution of this pathology and his stabilization. The goal was to construct a clinical and evolutionary perspective taking into account the progression of symptoms over time until the onset of psychosis. Despite us being limited by a neurobiological exploration that yielded no apparent results, the semiotic analysis of the patient’s symptoms, writings, and symbols allowed us to research the different precocious phases of the disease, as well as the psychopathological analysis of his symptoms.Results: This method allowed us to determine the first symptom, to identify the initial period of disorders and their relationships with vulnerability factors (parental trauma, genetics), to describe their evolution according to age, and to trace the symptoms of psychotic transition. Our aim was to emphasize the preventive role of early treatment of prepsychotic disorders. We consider the impact of anxiety on the patient's neuropsychic development and on the genetic origins of the disease.Conclusion: We emphasize the preventive approach, which consists in detecting the subjects at risk of psychotic transition and determining an appropriate psychotherapy to avoid any recurrence or aggravation of the disorders.",

Sexual obsession is common in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, identifying sexual obsession early in treatment has significant implications for appropriate multidisciplinary management and prognosis. We report the case of a Hispanic male in his 20s who presented with self-injurious behavior and worsening psychotic symptoms in the context of a recent diagnosis of schizophrenia and without a past diagnosis or historical symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This report elucidates the importance of identifying the underlying cause of self-injurious behavior, which in this young man was due to new onset OCD presenting as sexual obsession comorbid with schizophrenia. Olanzapine, paroxetine, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) were administered with good therapeutic response.",

      "abstract": "Sexual assault as a major psychological trauma and a crime of violence evokes immediate symptoms of posttraumatic stress and, for many victims, long-term posttraumatic psychological sequelae. The victim, as the recipient of the rapist's anger and need to control, experiences terror, fear of death, and helplessness. This results in classic posttraumatic symptoms of haunting, intrusive recollections, numbing or constriction of feelings and focus, and increased arousal. When this psychological trauma is not integrated, anxiety, depression, phobias, impaired sexual and social adjustment, negative self-image, and diminished capacity to enjoy life follow. Concepts of posttraumatic stress are reviewed and a definition of sexual assault is offered. The posttraumatic stress response to sexual assault is considered under the phases of response and symptoms, followed by the psychodynamics of this particular psychic trauma. A brief overview of treatment is outlined.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The core problem of addicts is addiction and not the other mental disorders that may be present. This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

Patients have to be back at their baseline functional level once the disorder has resolved. This is a heterogeneous group of patients who have either a disorder similar to schizophrenia or something closer to a mood disorder. Objectives To analyze clinical, psychopathological and epidemiological characteristics of schizophreniform disorder and also review causes, incidence, prevalence, diagnostic, therapeutic tools and the importance of maintaining the treatment, because of the abandonment of the treatment, which is a predictor of relapses. Methods A review of the main impact literature concerning schizophreniform disorder is done during the last five years: prevalence, incidence, pathogenesis and its relationship with other psychiatric disorders encoded in DSM-V are studied. Results The etiology is unknown. Psychotic symptoms can be treated with antipsychotics for 3 to 6 months. They usually respond faster than patients with schizophrenia (75% vs 20% respond within 8 days). Conclusions The disease has a favorable prognosis, and has similarities with mood disorders. However, some data suggest a close relationship to schizophrenia. In support of the relationship with mood disorders, patients have more affective symptoms and a better outcome than patients with schizophrenia. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "Sir: Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in motor behavior and changes in thought, mood, and vigilance 1 and occurs in a variety of medical and neuropsychiatric conditions. 2 Catatonia has been documented as occurring in alcohol withdrawal in rodents, 3 but not in humans.We report the case of a patient in whom alcohol withdrawal presented as catatonia.Case report.Mr. A, aged 35 years, presented in January 2006 with a history of alcohol use over the last 10 years.He fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence for the last 5 years.He presented with tremors, irritability, anorexia, and insomnia within 24 hours of abrupt cessation of alcohol intake.Seventy-two hours after cessation of alcohol intake, he developed signs of negativism, mutism, and psychomotor agitation lasting 2 days, followed by psychomotor retardation, stereotypies, and stupor over the next 2 days, fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for catatonia.There were no psychotic or mood symptoms, clouding of consciousness, disorientation, or any general medical condition that could explain these symptoms.He had experienced a similar episode 2 years previous, following 3 days of abstinence from alcohol, that remitted upon treatment with lorazepam.Family history was positive for alcohol dependence in first-and second-degree relatives but was negative for psychotic or mood disorders.The findings of laboratory investigations were within normal limits.As the patient's condition could not be described adequately by DSM-IV criteria for alcohol withdrawal or catatonia, the diagnosis of alcohol-induced psychotic disorder was made, with onset during alcohol withdrawal and presenting with catatonia.Mr. A was treated with lorazepam 16 mg per day and with vitamin supplements.His symptoms remitted completely within 72 hours.Catatonia has been documented in alcohol dependence in relation to drug interactions involving disulfiram 4 and in delirium. 1 The temporal correlation between alcohol abstinence and the appearance of catatonia in the absence of these other causes suggests that the catatonia in this case was due to alcohol withdrawal.Perturbations in γaminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic transmission have been implicated in the pathophysiology of both catatonia 2 and alcohol withdrawal. 5,6 Furthermore, the GABA A modulator lorazepam is effective in both conditions. 1,7 To our knowledge, this case is the first such case reported in the literature.",

      "title": "Treatment of premature ejaculation",
      "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual disorder, and it may have a profound negative impact on a man and his partner's lives. Different organizations and societies have no consensus on the definition and classifications of PE. However, most organizations and societies include in their definitions the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), the control of ejaculation, and the distress or impact of interpersonal difficulties. Evaluation procedures have been standardized in clinical studies by the development of an objective measurement of IELT (using a stopwatch) and by the introduction of patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires on ejaculation control and sexual satisfaction. The identification of four different patterns of PE—lifelong, acquired, normal variant, and premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction—is critical because of different underlying pathogeneses and consequently different management approaches. The optimal treatment for PE should be individualized, based on a patient's symptoms, expectations, and underlying variant causes. Most lifelong PE patients need pharmacotherapy (possibly in combination with psychosexual counseling) as a first-line treatment because of the underlying neurobiological etiology and the impact of PE on the couple's relationship. The management of acquired PE is etiologically specific and may include pharmacotherapy for erectile function management in men with comorbid erectile dysfunction (ED). Men with natural variable PE complain of early ejaculation in situational or coincidental conditions; the ejaculation is inconsistent and occurs irregularly. Psychoeducation and reassurance are indicated for men with this type of PE. Psychotherapy or sex counseling is the first choice of treatment for men with premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction. All pharmacotherapies such as long-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or on-demand topical anesthetics are off-label indications, The benefits of pharmacotherapy toward improving ejaculation times should be weighed against their safety profiles. The development of the short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dapoxetine hydrochloride (30 mg and 60 mg) for oral on-demand use opened a new era of PE treatment. Other potential pharmacotherapies such as tramadol, lidocaine/prilocaine spray, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are still under development. Their safety and efficacy profiles should be further evaluated and supported by additional clinical studies.",

      "title": "Vulnerability to addictive behaviors: the Associational Memory‐Appetitive Systems Relations Model",
      "abstract": "The concept of behavioral addictions invites controversy, but is slowly penetrating psychiatric consensus. Any addiction involves five components1: a) existence of appetitive needs and b) repeated attempts at satiation of these needs through ingestion of a substance or engagement in a behavior (appetitive effects), followed at some point by c) preoccupation with obtaining appetitive effects (e.g., craving, tolerance), d) loss of control over time spent engaged in appetitive effect-related behavior (e.g., duration, relapse), and e) undesired or negative consequences (such as failure to meet work, familial and social obligations; suffering physical injury; emotional turmoil) resulting from continued engagement in the behavior2. The fundamental underlying perspective is that addiction involves disruption of appetitive functioning; that is, of behavior directed towards fulfilling specific human psycho-socio-biological needs3. It has been theorized that addictive phenomena operate through appetitive mechanisms involving, in part, a misleading, temporary subjective sense of neurobiological fitness4, 5. This experience may be identified through subjective changes in a) affect (e.g., feelings of joy, or merely improvement of affect), b) level of arousal (e.g., alertness or sedation/calm), or c) cognition (e.g., clarity, enlightenment, or decrease in tempo of stream of thought). One may learn to associate in memory the appetitive need (internal cue) with the contexts (location, time of day, situation) and behavior (e.g., sex, work) that led to its temporary subjective satiation, even though the result may not actually be biologically adaptive. The Associational Memory-Appetitive Systems Relations Model of addiction describes how appetitive motives may become excessive, atypically elicited, or misdirected5. There are four main components of this model. First, it is acknowledged that addictions (e.g., alcohol use) have a substantial genetic component (e.g., between 10 and 50% is accounted for by genetics). The model theorizes that one's appetitive needs are impacted by one's genetics. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to substance or behavioral addictions may have a different physiological reaction when engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., involving valence of subjective reward, dissociation of wanting and liking, or involvement of counteradaptation processes). The neurochemistry of an individual can potentially create an inclination toward maladaptive appetitive functioning. DNA epigenetic processes such as cytosine methylation may impact gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (part of an appetitive motivation pathway) subsequent to initial recreational drug intake and possibly involvement in other addictive behaviors. Prolonged periods of stress, particularly at a young age (adverse childhood experiences), may lead to disruption in brain reward cascade functioning. Such disruption, in turn, may increase one's vulnerability to addictive behavioral rewards. Second, the social and physical environmental settings that one traverses will impact what information one learns and how one thinks, and may facilitate which behaviors one may select to perform. Daily life social \"pushes\" (stresses, social influence) and \"pulls\" (seductions) provide possible avenues of addiction. For example, encouragement by peers to engage in drug use or marketing the \"excitement\" of local casinos may push or pull one to explore an addictive substance or behavior. Production and distribution routes of various addictive behaviors will impact what is available to the potential \"consumer\". Accessibility and awareness of nearby addictive behavior will impact which behaviors one will initiate. Third, one's lifestyle inputs also impact what behaviors may \"pop\" to mind in daily life. A child who grows up with parents who were engaged in addictive behaviors may be relatively likely to tie appetitive needs fulfillment to an addiction-related lifestyle through vicarious learning3, or else be quite wary to fall victim to such a behavior pattern. In addition, through vicarious experiences, one may learn the vocabulary associated with an addictive behavior (e.g., cannabis \"head high\" versus a \"body high\"). That is, one may be socialized and prepared at a young age for entrée into involvement with an addictive behavior later on. When one contemplates trial of an addictive behavior, it should be mentioned that acquisition skills are needed to be able to engage in the behavior with minimal conflict. This includes behavior-specific conversation initiation skills (i.e., knowing how to meet a \"supplier\" and acquire the addictive behavior; for example, arranging a purchase of cocaine, or time with a sex worker) and a means of exchange (e.g., money or favors for drugs). Involvement in different addictions may vary over the course of human development. For example, persons as young as three years of age may suffer from television addiction. Persons as young as eight years of age may become addicted to caffeine. There are many behaviors that could be experienced as appetitive and become addictive (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and other drug misuse; binge overeating/food addiction; shopping; electronic media-related; love and sex; workaholism; exercise; and gambling)3. A large minority or a majority of people have tried at least once engaging in various addictive behaviors (e.g., overeating, alcohol use, overspending). More-than-initial trial of an addictive behavior is partly a function of attraction to that behavior. Attraction-related variables include the social image associated with the behavior (e.g., mentioned in the recovery movement, of being \"hip, slick and cool\"), what one's peers are engaged in (peer social influence), as well neurobiological effects of engaging in the behavior. Fourth, it is through the process of associative learning that appetitive needs come to be subjectively satiated through adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Associative learning and memory have been considered in several recent models of addictive behaviors. Cues in an environment that otherwise would be considered innocuous can stand out to be emotionally salient when influenced by motivational states6. These cues can range from eating behavior being triggered when seeing fast food sign cues or eating locations, or a drug user becoming excited or agitated when in sight of his/her drug of choice. Some individuals may not, through deliberate cognition, recognize that their decisional processes are being influenced by maladaptive or extreme reward cues. It has been proposed7 that appetitive motivation is controlled through a dual process of deliberate, conscious, executive, regulatory cognition interacting with relatively automatic, implicit processes, in response to addiction-related cues. Over time, in part due to relatively automatic prompting by multiple cues, one may experience excessive thoughts about and desire to perform a behavior. In turn, excessive time may be spent to plan and engage in the behavior, and possibly recover from its effects (e.g., from \"hangovers\"), and less time may be spent on other activities, despite diminishing appetitive effects1, 8. One is most vulnerable to initial and continued trial of an addictive behavior if the initial consequences are experienced as \"filling the gap\" in one's sense of well-being (i.e., of being satiated, fulfilled). A widely used saying within the recovery movement is that at first the addiction \"does something for the person\" and then it \"does something to the person\". In conclusion, appetitive needs are instinctually embodied in every human being from birth. For at least the past one hundred years, researchers have been exploring the parameters of appetitive needs in human beings9. The interface between one's genetics, social and physical environmental cues, lifestyle situations, development and adaptation (epigenetics and associative learning), and associative memory, may underlie addictive behavior. There is a lot to be learned from an appetitive needs perspective on what is at the root of an addictive process. Appetitive needs which might be explored include those of dominance/leadership, respect, being part of a herd, providing nurturance or being nurtured, and obtaining pleasure3, 5. More research is needed to explore a taxonomy of appetitive needs, and how different appetitive needs act as sources of vulnerability factors and may transform into specific addictive behaviors.",

The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms.

      "abstract": "A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is essential because many psychiatric symptoms are nonspecific. This situation is analogous to a patient presenting in general internal medicine with fever or nausea. The presence of a single symptom, for example, depressed mood, is never pathognomonic of a specific disorder. All psychiatric disorders are based on a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is periodically updated by the American Psychiatric Association. The fourth edition (DSM-IV) is currently in use. It was published in 1994 and is expected to be revised in 2006 or 2007. For patients with psychiatric symptoms, the biopsychosocial model is widely used. With this approach, the biologic, psychologic, and social factors contributing to the patient's clinical presentation are evaluated. Some psychiatric symptoms indicate severe problems, whereas others are much less important to the extent that they may not be clinically relevant. A key concept is whether the symptom interferes with a patient's functioning or causes distress. For example, a patient may have a fear of heights. If this acrophobia never causes an alteration in activity, then intervention likely is not necessary. However, if a patient hesitates to visit offices on higher floors of an office building, the distress during the visits or avoidance of these situations warrants intervention.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is essential because many psychiatric symptoms are nonspecific. This situation is analogous to a patient presenting in general internal medicine with fever or nausea. The presence of a single symptom, for example, depressed mood, is never pathognomonic of a specific disorder. All psychiatric disorders are based on a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is periodically updated by the American Psychiatric Association. The fourth edition (DSM-IV) is currently in use. It was published in 1994 and is expected to be revised in 2006 or 2007. For patients with psychiatric symptoms, the biopsychosocial model is widely used. With this approach, the biologic, psychologic, and social factors contributing to the patient's clinical presentation are evaluated. Some psychiatric symptoms indicate severe problems, whereas others are much less important to the extent that they may not be clinically relevant. A key concept is whether the symptom interferes with a patient's functioning or causes distress. For example, a patient may have a fear of heights. If this acrophobia never causes an alteration in activity, then intervention likely is not necessary. However, if a patient hesitates to visit offices on higher floors of an office building, the distress during the visits or avoidance of these situations warrants intervention.",

      "abstract": "Work stress is defined as the emotional and/or physical reaction that the human being has in situations that surround him; in addition it can also be defined as a physiological and psychological response of the worker. Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

      "title": "Evaluating Adolescents With Fatigue",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Unexplained fatigue in adolescents is a common and frustrating complaint that can pose a challenge for even the most experienced physicians. Although the cause usually is benign and self-limited, occasionally there is a serious underlying disorder. This symptom cannot be dismissed without performing a thorough medical history, detailed psychosocial profile, and careful physical examination. Selective use of laboratory and radiologic studies should be considered when specifically indicated. If the cause remains unclear, sequential visits often provide clues for the practitioner and reassurance for the family. The purpose of this article is to offer guidelines to the clinician caring for adolescents who have prolonged, unexplained fatigue and to stress the value of a thorough history and physical examination.For purposes of this discussion, fatigue will be defined as abnormal exhaustion after usual activities. An arbitrary cutoff of 1 month is used to distinguish acute from chronic fatigue. The term chronic fatigue syndrome is avoided because criteria for this condition are not clearly established in children or adolescents, and data must be extrapolated from studies in adults. The term neurally mediated hypotension is used to describe a fall in blood pressure in response to assuming the upright posture, physical events, and emotional stressors. Affected patients may be syncopal or presyncopal. Neurally mediated hypotension also is referred to in the literature as neurocardiogenic syncope, vasovagal reflex, vasodepressor syncope, and autonomic dysfunction.The best way to approach a problem of this nature is to establish a good relationship with adolescents and their parents so they will trust your recommendations and not pressure you into unnecessary tests or referrals. The examination begins when the family enters the office by greeting the patient first to establish a direct relationship immediately. It is worthwhile to obtain the history while the patient is fully clothed because adolescents usually feel more relaxed under these circumstances. Initially, the patient and parents are interviewed together, assuring both parties that there will be adequate time later to speak with the examiner alone. While taking the history, the clinician should demonstrate a willingness to listen and be particularly alert for any clues of a hidden agenda or an underlying illness.More sensitive issues are discussed with the patient alone. Every effort must be made to assure privacy and confidentiality when obtaining personal information from adolescents. Credit must be give to Cohen, who has refined a method for organizing the psychosocial history that was developed by Berman in 1972. This system has been expanded and modified further at the SUNY Upstate Medical University Adolescent Medicine Center in Syracuse. The questions are structured in an easily remembered format that stresses the importance of connecting with adolescents HEADS FIRST (Table 1). This approach emphasizes that “getting into adolescent heads” is just as necessary as performing a physical examination. In many instances, the information obtained during the psychosocial interview is key to elucidating the cause of unexplained fatigue in teenagers.The issues outlined in Table 1 can be addressed with the traditional verbal approach, using the suggested cue words, or by having the patient complete a self-administered personal questionnaire. With either method, the questions should be answered privately and reviewed confidentially with the examiner unless the patient specifically requests otherwise. Most parents respect their adolescents’ need for privacy and appreciate the opportunity for them to receive one-on-one counseling with an experienced health professional.There is considerable overlap in the signs and symptoms caused by the various underlying conditions associated with fatigue. Manifestations are often subtle and should be correlated closely with the overall clinical picture. Thus, clinicians must have a high index of awareness when interpreting historical data, physical findings, and other pertinent information in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue.The onset, severity, and duration of the fatigue as well as any aggravating or relieving factors are explored when taking the history. Particular attention should be paid to any significant changes in the patient’s physical activity level, exercise tolerance, and ability to keep up with peers. Lack of sleep due to getting to bed later, difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakening, or getting up earlier in the morning should be considered. A careful review of systems is also essential, with close attention to any constitutional symptoms, such as unexplained fevers, chills, sweating, anorexia, weight loss, or lymphadenopathy, which may suggest the presence of an underlying infection, malignancy, or other inflammatory process. A history of an antecedent “mono-like” illness with negative diagnostic studies is relatively common and suggestive of an infectious cause. However, the significance of this association is unknown.Recent weight gain as well as weight loss should alert the clinician to the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or underlying medical condition. Teenagers who have eating disorders often resort to desperate, even dangerous measures to improve their self-esteem or to enhance their image. Attempts at weight reduction often involve self-injurious behaviors, such as severe caloric deprivation, excessive exercise, self-induced vomiting, and the use of appetite suppressants, laxatives, diuretics, or emetics. Fatigue from rapid fluid shifts or hypokalemia is especially common among bulimics, whose weight may fluctuate dramatically as a result of the frequent episodes of binging and purging. In contrast, patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa usually seem to have boundless energy, even in a state of severe emaciation.Adolescents who engage in competitive activities in which thinness or “making weight” are judged important to success are believed to be particularly susceptible to unhealthy weight control practices. Such activities include body building, cheerleading, dancing (especially ballet), distance running, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, horse racing, modeling, rowing, swimming, weight-class football, and wrestling. As the preoccupation with thinness supersedes the desire to be healthy, physically active young women are at risk for a group of signs and symptoms known as the female athlete triad. Lack of information and the strong desire to win contribute to this condition, which consists of abnormal eating patterns, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. In many instances, these girls become less competitive as they begin to tire more easily and have less stamina.Adolescents should be screened for stress, anxiety, and depression, which frequently are associated with fatigue in this age group. The three most common sources of conflict are problems at home, strained peer relationships, and school-related difficulties. Having a job or not having a job for those in financial need may be an added source of pressure. The practitioner also should look for feelings of sadness, changes in behavior, difficulty concentrating, declining school performance, and other symptoms of depression. Most teens respond openly when asked if they get upset or depressed easily and if they have ever felt like hurting themselves or someone else. Any positive responses can be pursued by asking the patient to “tell me about this.” It must be stressed that adolescents who are actively suicidal or homicidal require immediate intervention by mental health experts, legal authorities, or both.Recent exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus as well as to other contagious diseases such as hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis should be determined. Asking about pets, tick bites, recent travel, and water supply sometimes is fruitful. A search also should be made for symptoms of cardiac disorders, pulmonary conditions, endocrinopathies, gastrointestinal problems, and renal abnormalities. The menstrual history should be obtained from adolescent girls, looking for amenorrhea, irregular periods, or excessive bleeding, which may suggest the possibility of an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous miscarriage, recent termination, or threatened abortion. In addition, the patients should be asked about the use of any over-the-counter or prescribed medications that have a known sedative effect.The clinician also should inquire about symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension, a condition that has been associated with unexplained fatigue in adolescents. Neurally mediated hypotension leads to symptoms after prolonged periods of upright posture, standing in place, standing in the shower, and even sitting. It is especially common when the patient is in a warm environment and after emotionally stressful events. In addition, it may be seen immediately after exercise or soon after eating in some patients as blood flow is shifted to the intestines during the process of digestion.Common symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension include recurrent light-headedness and fainting, which often are associated with postexertional fatigue for 24 to 72 hours. Of particular note, persistent fatigue is a prominent feature of this condition in many adolescents, even if there is no history of fainting. In addition, headaches, myalgias, and mental confusion may occur. The latter frequently is described by patients as being in a “mental fog,” with difficulty concentrating, trouble paying attention, having a hard time staying on task, and having problems finding the right words. Occasionally, shortness of breath with or without chest pain may occur.Any history of recurrent or persistent fever should be documented in the clinician’s office. Unexplained temperature elevation suggests the presence of an underlying infection, neoplasm, or other inflammatory process such as Crohn disease. Hypothermia occurs frequently in patients who have experienced rapid or excessive weight loss. This finding is especially common among adolescents who have eating disorders in whom the low body temperature helps to conserve energy to help compensate for losses from severe caloric deprivation or purging. In addition, hypothyroidism always should be suspected in teenagers who are fatigued, whose temperatures tend to run below normal, and who gain weight in spite of what appear to be appropriate restrictions in dietary intake.Anxiety and stress are the most common causes of tachycardia in the practitioner’s office. They also are important sources of fatigue in adolescents, especially in patients who are not sleeping well. Marijuana is another frequent cause of tachycardia and should be considered in teenagers who appear to be excessively tired or poorly motivated. Stimulant drugs that have been prescribed, purchased over-the-counter, or taken illegally may cause an accelerated heart rate. Fatigue is relatively common when the effects of these drugs begin to wear off. Endocrine abnormalities, including Addison disease, diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism, as well as a number of pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions may cause an elevated pulse rate in patients who are fatigued.Significant weight loss from voluntary caloric restriction is characteristically accompanied by sinus bradycardia, especially in patients who are hypothermic. This is an important physical finding that may help to distinguish adolescents who have eating disorders or those who are simply getting in shape from those who have an underlying organic cause for their weight loss. On the other hand, unexplained weight gain in patients who have bradycardia and fatigue should raise the suspicion of hypothyroidism. A slow pulse rate also may be caused by various medications or street drugs that have a known sedative effect.Abnormalities in the respiratory rate in association with fatigue may indicate a cardiac, pulmonary, or metabolic disorder. Variations in the breathing pattern also may be seen with the use, abuse, or withdrawal of many prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or street drugs.As with tachycardia, anxiety and stress are the most common causes of hypertension identified in the examination room. However, the finding of elevated blood pressure in association with fatigue may be due to several important medical conditions, including connective tissue disorders, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, hyperthyroidism, and renal abnormalities. Routine use, abuse, or withdrawal of over-the-counter drugs, prescription medications, or illicit psychoactive substances also may cause hypertension and fatigue.Delayed orthostatic hypotension after prolonged standing also has been described in patients who have unexplained fatigue (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Hypotension also may be noted as an adverse effect of various medications or in relation to abuse of street drugs. Adolescents who have Addison disease are especially susceptible to dehydration with hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, particularly during periods of physical stress. Addison disease always should be suspected in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially when there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss.It is very important to plot height routinely throughout the adolescent years. Failure of a patient to progress along the expected parameters should draw immediate attention to the possibility of an underlying systemic process affecting growth and causing unexplained fatigue. In contrast, a normal linear growth velocity all but excludes the presence of an underlying endocrinopathy, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing syndrome, which may cause fatigue in association with obesity. A normal linear growth velocity also lessens the possibility of chronic cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or renal disorders in teenagers who are excessively tired.It is also very important to plot weight throughout adolescence. Patients who have excessive weight gain or loss should be evaluated carefully for the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or medical condition. Poor weight gain over time also may be a subtle manifestation of a serious underlying illness, such as inflammatory bowel disease, especially in adolescents who have an unexplained low energy level.The examiner’s first impression about the patient’s overall well-being can be very insightful. Does the patient look ill or well? Does the patient seem to be depressed, anxious, or stressed? Does the patient seem to be adequately nourished?The skin may serve as a window to underlying systemic causes of fatigue in adolescents. Jaundice suggests the presence of hepatitis or hemolysis. A yellow cast to the skin due to hypercarotenemia may be seen in patients who have anorexia nervosa and ingest large amounts of yellow-orange fruits and vegetables. This is a benign physical finding that resembles icterus, but the sclera are not involved. It should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of an eating disorder that may be otherwise unrecognized.Cyanosis may indicate the presence of a significant abnormality in the cardiovascular or pulmonary system, especially when digital clubbing also is present. The findings may be extremely subtle and only detectable by meticulous examination. A patient of mine had a somewhat sallow appearance. He was tired all the time, but was otherwise totally asymptomatic. During the consultation, he had bounding pulses that eventually led to the diagnosis of a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation as the cause of symptoms.Pallor usually is associated with iron deficiency anemia resulting from inadequate dietary intake, rapid growth, or blood loss. The latter is especially common in adolescent girls who are having heavy menstrual periods. However, many other important causes of anemia must be considered in this age group, including chronic inflammation, hemolysis, malignancy, and vitamin B12 deficiency, the latter especially in those who are on a vegan diet. Fatigue is a relatively late manifestation of anemia and usually is noted only in moderate-to-severe anemia that has developed over time. Pallor also may be a sign of anxiety, abuse of psychoactive drugs, and the allergic tension fatigue syndrome.Generalized hyperpigmentation may be seen in patients who have fatigue associated with Addison disease. A clue to this diagnosis is involvement of the unexposed areas of skin as well as accentuation of the hyperpigmentation over the axillae, nipples, umbilicus, genitalia, or extensor surfaces of the joints. The clinician also should look carefully at the dorsum of the hands for evidence of superficial ulcerations, calluses, or scars in patients who have bulimia. This is known as Russell sign and is caused by using the fingers to induce vomiting in an effort to control weight. Many patients who have bulimia suffer from fatigue because of fluid or electrolyte imbalance as well as associated depression. Other signs of self-mutilation, such as cuts, scars, scratches, burns, and carved-out tatoos, may be seen in patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem.A number of skin findings may provide insight into the presence of an underlying connective tissue disease, infectious process, or other inflammatory condition that could cause fatigue in adolescents. A butterfly or discoid rash and photosensitivity are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Flushed cheeks followed by the appearance of a lacy, reticulated rash over the trunk and extremities are found in Fifth disease, which may cause persistent fatigue in teenagers. An evanescent, salmon-colored rash that has irregular borders or serpiginous margins is seen in patients who have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and frequently is accompanied by fever. Subcutaneous nodules also may occur with this condition and are located near the olecranon process, on the dorsal aspect of the hands or knees, near the ears, and over pressure areas such as the scapulae, sacrum, buttocks, and heels. These nodules are usually nontender. In contrast, erythema nodosum is characterized by exquisitely tender, erythematous nodular lesions over the extensor surfaces of the extremities, especially on the pretibial surface of the legs. These lesions frequently recur and are associated with many inflammatory disorders that cause fatigue.Raynaud phenomenon, with characteristic color changes of the fingers and toes, should raise suspicion of a connective tissue disease or other underlying cause. Nailbed capillary changes with dilation and tortuosity of the vessels may be a very subtle finding in patients who have collagen vascular diseases. Cutaneous sclerosis, especially of the digits and face, is associated with scleroderma. In addition, an erythematous, purplish discoloration of the eyelids, forehead, cheeks, temples, dorsal interphalangeal joints, and extensor surfaces of the extremities suggests dermatomyositis.The presence of “allergic shiners” or a bluish discoloration under the eyes often is seen with sinusitis as well as with the allergic tension fatigue syndrome. Injection of the bulbar conjunctivae is common among those who use marijuana. Sjögren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder of unknown cause characterized by dry eyes, xerostomia, salivary gland enlargement, and a high incidence of connective tissue disease. Evidence of iritis or uveitis suggests the presence of a connective tissue disorder or other underlying inflammatory process, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Several oral findings have been noted in patients who have eating disorders, including enamel erosion or caries, particularly over the inner aspect of the upper teeth. This finding probably is related to repeated exposure to gastric contents following self-induced vomiting. Swelling of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands also has been described in those who have bulimia. Enlargement of the submandibular glands may be especially difficult to distinguish from lymphadenopathy in the anterior cervical region. In most instances, the salivary tissue has a softer consistency than the enlarged nodes, but there may be considerable overlap. Infection or other causes of inflammation in the salivary glands also may be associated with fatigue.Evidence of stomatitis, gingivitis, or glossitis in teenagers who are excessively tired may indicate an underlying systemic process. Recurrent mouth ulcers, especially if they are unusually severe or recalcitrant to therapy, are relatively common in Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Behçet syndrome is a rare multisystem vasculitis characterized by the triad of recurrent oral ulcers, iridocyclitis, and recurrent ulcers of the external genitalia as well as a variety of other findings that may be accompanied by fatigue. In addition, hyperpigmentation of the gums is seen with Addison disease.The adolescent’s strength should be assessed to differentiate conditions that are associated with muscular weakness from other causes of fatigue. Muscular dystrophy always must be considered. Patients who have myasthenia gravis often experience weakness only late in the day or after physical activity. The clinician should search for other signs of myasthenia gravis that sometimes are subtle, including evidence of ptosis, weakness of the extraocular muscles, and dysphagia. The diminished strength noted in dermatomyositis may be generalized, but it is predominantly proximal, with involvement of the limb girdles and anterior flexors.Objective evidence of arthritis strongly supports an organic cause for the fatigue, such as connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, infection, or neoplasm. Localized bone pain or tenderness to direct palpation may be associated with anatomic lesions, both benign and malignant. Unexplained bone pain that awakens the patient at night is especially concerning for leukemia or similar invasive processes. Clubbing of the fingers or toes suggests the possibility of chronic pulmonary, cardiac, or liver disease.A careful neurologic examination should be performed to help exclude rare causes of fatigue in adolescents, such as multiple sclerosis. The Chiari malformation also may be associated with subtle neurologic signs in association with fatigue. I recently had a patient in whom the cerebellar tonsils protruded into the spinal canal and compressed the nerves innervating the palate. The floppy palatal tissue resulted in obstructive sleep apnea, and the patient awakened unrefreshed in the morning. The family sought medical attention after the teachers complained that the girl had been falling asleep in class. A decompression procedure was performed by neurosurgery, and the girl’s fatigue resolved completely.Facial tenderness suggests the presence of sinusitis, although this finding often is absent in this condition. Persistent lymphadenopathy may be seen with infection, malignancy, connective tissue disease, or other inflammatory processes. The thyroid gland should be palpated for any enlargement or nodules. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism may be associated with fatigue. The lungs, heart, and abdomen should be assessed carefully for any abnormalities that may provide a clue to the diagnosis. The costovertebral angles should be palpated for any tenderness that may suggest pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, or other renal abnormality. In addition, patients who have generalized ligamentous laxity frequently experience vague musculoskeletal pain and are tired, especially late in the day. Finally, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered in adolescent girls and a pelvic examination performed when indicated.The differential diagnosis of fatigue is extensive and includes numerous organic disorders as well as many psychosocial-medical conditions (Table 2). Sometimes a combination of factors contributes to the fatigue, especially when it is unduly prolonged. It is relatively common for an initial medical illness to take on features of a psychiatric condition as the process evolves. Psychologic issues may emerge as the primary agenda or develop as a consequence of an organic illness. A psychiatric diagnosis should not be assigned solely by the process of exclusion; the appropriate diagnostic criteria must be met before such a diagnosis is made.Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression may be especially difficult to sort out in adolescents who are fatigued. Failure to attend school may compound an already difficult situation by perpetuating progressive absenteeism. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility that masked school avoidance may be contributing to the fatigue. The hyperventilation syndrome may present with fatigue in association with difficulty breathing, chest pain, lightheadedness, headaches, abdominal pain, and numbness or tingling of the extremities. In addition, fatigue may be a sign of certain eating disorders, especially bulimia and obesity, which frequently are accompanied by poor self-esteem, feelings of guilt, and depression. Patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa typically do not tire easily unless they are moribund or the weight loss has been rapid.Clinicians always should consider the possibility of Addison disease in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially if there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. There usually is generalized hyperpigmentation with involvement of unexposed surfaces as well as accentuation in areas of predilection, as described earlier. Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia are useful diagnostic features, but are not always present. The most definitive diagnostic test is the ACTH stimulation test (described later). It is imperative to consider Addison disease in the differential diagnosis because if it is not recognized and treated, an adrenal crisis may supervene.Many adolescents who have unexplained fatigue begin with a “mono-like” illness that never resolves completely, and all diagnostic testing results are negative. As with acute infectious mononucleosis, these patients often have a history of severe sore throat, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, headaches, nausea, myalgia, and arthralgia with or without evidence of arthritis. Many of the symptoms recur or linger for months in association with the fatigue. In addition, whenever a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is being entertained, the clinician should consider the possibility of infection with Toxoplasma gondii or cytomegalovirus, which may cause similar symptoms.The association between orthostatic blood pressure changes and prolonged fatigue was described by Streeten and Anderson in 1992, who studied seven patients who had lightheadedness, fatigue, “weakness,” and sometimes syncope. Blood pressures were measured every minute with an automated oscillometer while the patients remained standing. There was no fall in blood pressure after standing for a few minutes, which is the endpoint in traditional testing. However, there was a severe fall in blood pressure in all patients after they stood for 13 to 30 minutes, often with syncope or presyncope. Rowe and associates later described four adolescents who had a history of fatigue and underwent tilt-table testing. This procedure induced significant hypotension in all after they were tilted upright for 12 to 23 minutes. Their fatigue improved dramatically after they were treated for orthostatic hypotension.It is not known why patients who have prolonged fatigue develop these cardiovascular changes when they assume the upright posture. When normal individuals stand up, blood pools in the legs, catecholamines increase to compensate for the decreased venous return to the heart, and there is a compensatory increase in heart rate that involves more vigorous contractions. The reduced amount of blood flow to the heart is pumped more efficiently to the vital organs, especially the brain. In contrast, when individuals who have neurally mediated hypotension stand up, there appears to be a “miscommunication” between the heart and the brain. The heart rate slows while the vessels in the arms and legs dilate. As a result, even more blood is taken from the brain, and the patients feel faint. Finally, an abnormal increase in heart rate after prolonged standing has been described in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue. This condition is known as delayed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and it may occur with or without hypotension.In many instances, no diagnostic studies are required after a thorough history and careful physical examination. The costs of investigative studies are high, and any unnecessary testing should be avoided unless specifically indicated. However, if the diagnosis remains uncertain, the clinician should consider a screening evaluation that includes the baseline tests shown in Table 3.The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum electrolytes, liver profile, and urinalysis allow rapid assessment of target organ status in response to a systemic illness. Rheumatologic studies help exclude systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases that may present with fatigue. Thyroid studies always should be performed because manifestations of thyroid conditions often are subtle early in the course of the illness. A high morning cortisol level goes against a diagnosis of Addison disease, but the ACTH stimulation test is the definitive test to exclude this condition. In normal individuals, the serum cortisol level increases two- to three-fold 1 hour after intravenous administration of a synthetic ACTH prepa",

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

      "abstract": "Key Points Anxiety symptoms (eg, fears about harm to self or loved ones; distress when child is asked to engage in feared activity; somatic complaints associated with fears) are common in children and adolescents; at some life stages and in some circumstances, a certain level of anxiety is developmentally appropriate.Anxiety symptoms may be features of 1 of 6 anxiety disorders or may cause functional impairment in the absence of a diagnosable disorder. Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

İnsan yaşamının üçte birini kapsayan bu karmaşık fizyolojik süreç, dolaşım, solunum, kas-iskelet ve merkezi sinir sistemi birçok sistemin sağlıklı bir şekilde işlemesinde önemli bir role sahiptir. Bireylerin sağlığını etkilediği gibi yaşam kalitelerini de etkileyen önemli bir olaydır. Uyku kalitesi ise bireylerin kendilerini zihinsel ve bedensel olarak iyi hissetmesidir. Uyku kalitesi kronik hastalık varlığı, stres, yaşam stili, çevresel faktörler, ekonomik durum, iş ve sosyal yaşam gibi birçok faktörden etkilenmektedir. Özellikle psikolojik stres ve uyku sorunları birbirleriyle çift yönlü bir ilişkiye sahiptir. Stres faktörleri uyku kalitesini etkilerken, uyku kalitesinin düşük olması da psikolojik semptomları kötüleştirebilir. İnfertilite tanı ve tedavi sürecinde uyku sorunlarının meydana geldiği yapılan çalışmalar ile gösterilmiştir. Bu sürecin getirdiği psikolojik sıkıntılar ve stres nedeniyle uyku süresinde kısalma, uyku verimliliğinde azalma ve uykunun sık sık bölünmesi gibi sorunlar meydana gelmektedir. Ancak yapılan çalışmalarda infertil bireylerde somatik semptomlar ve psikolojik sıkıntılara değinilmiş olsa da uyku sorunları yeteri kadar incelenmemiş bir konudur.

We propose an approach which analyzes pain according to various independent axes, in particular somatic and psychosocial. Correct diagnosis of the pathophysiological mechanism of pain (excess nociception, neurogenous, maintenance by the sympathetic nervous system, or muscular) is required in order to direct appropriate symptomatic treatment. In parallel with this somatic approach to the aetiology of chronic pain, certain individual variables must be taken into account such as anxiety level, depression, personality, and reinforcement factors (secondary benefits) that can amplify pain or maintain the chronicity of pain in such patients.",

Behaviour during adolescence is driven by hormonal changes like increase in growth hormone, steroid hormones etc. There is pruning of neural pathways, such that the parts of brain that are most active during adolescence are best developed and those parts that are not utilized remain under-developed later on in adulthood. Common mental disorders during adolescence are emotional disorders like anxiety disorders, depression; conduct disorders like oppositional defiant disorders; hyperkinetic disorders and other psychotic disorders. Multiple tools or questionnaires are available to apply on adolescents and children for screening as well as diagnosing them with mental disorders like Rutter Child Scale A and Rutter Child Scale B, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), K-SADS (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia), ISC (Interview Schedule for Children), CAS (Child Assessment Schedule), CAPA (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment), DISC (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) and the DICA (Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents) etc. Poverty, social disadvantage, violence, child abuse, academic failure are some of the risk factors associated with mental disorders. Prevalence of any psychiatric disorder in India is 11% and 8% among boys and girls respectively compared to US where it is 46% in the age group of 13-16 years irrespective of sex. nothing much has been achieved for adolescents under national mental health programme. Interventions like life skills education through community programs, internet or at school can help adolescents bring confidence in them and ability to cope with the stress",

      "abstract": "The Numbers of elderly people are gradually increasing in our society, and mood disorders are progressively increasing among older people. Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines.

      "title": "Pruritus Ani",
      "abstract": "Summary Pruritus ani, although it presents as the only symptom, never occurs alone, but is associated with bizarre gastrointestinal symptoms and sexual disorders. Depressive and paranoid trends are common. It is the leading symptom in a syndrome. This syndrome exists in its own right. No distinct personality type could be established; it was found to occur without personality disorder, in psychoneurotic and prepsychotic personalities, and in frank psychoses. Its origin can be traced to a reactivation in adult life of infantile (unconscious) fantasies about procreation centering round the anal function, which precede genital interest and knowledge of sex. These \"cloacal\" fantasies are revived in their original primitive mode, as bodily sensations rather than ideas; the symptoms thus represent the fantasy. They appear as distressing somatic symptoms because such archaic fantasies are incompatible with reality. A breakthrough into consciousness is thus prevented and psychotic delusions avoided. Revival of procreation fantasies must be more deeply disturbing in the man than in the woman; this is borne-out by the greater severity, longer duration, and preponderance of male cases. The syndrome is capable of reduction by psychotherapy. The structure of this syndrome is simpler than that of the psychoneuroses. By the absence of overt anxiety it can be separated from anxiety hysteria, and by the absence of true obsessions, with their tendency to displacement and spread, from obsessive-compulsive neurosis. Secondary gain is absent. Its psychopathology suggests a hypochondriacal syndrome with specific content. Freud classed hypochondria among the \"actualneuroses\" to which psychoanalysis had little to contribute. In psychiatry proper hypochondria is also a stepchild. Brachet speaks of it as a \"disorder of the imagination.\" Gillespie8 defines \"the syndrome of hypochondria\" as, \"A mental preoccupation with a real or supposititious physical or mental disorder, a discrepancy between the degree of preoccupation and the grounds for it, so that the former is far in excess of what is justified, and an affective condition best described as interest with conviction and consequent concern, and with an indifference to the opinion of the environment, including irresponsiveness to persuasion… usually inaccessible to psychotherapy… it affects men predominantly… it can shade into schizophrenia… in its mild form it is often erroneously diagnosed as anxiety neurosis or hysteria.\" This description neatly condenses our findings on patients with pruritus ani. It should perhaps be added that in the clinical example given by Gillespie of hypochondria there was, besides intestinal symptoms of \"a bizarre nature\" and \"persecutory ideas of a peculiar kind referring to his gullet and genital organs, \" also \"a tearing away at the anus.\"",

Objective: Review the literature on sexual dysfunction caused by neurological disorders, in men aged 19 to 44 years. Methodology: This is a narrative literature review. The collection of information about the theme was carried out through a search for scientific articles in the PubMed databases. The descriptions used in the search were “sexual dysfunction AND neurological disorders in men”, articles published in the last 5 years were considered. Results: Several neurological diseases with a very high correlation with DSM were found, such as: multiple sclerosis, ED being the main problem reported by patients, depression and its respective treatment, epilepsy, mainly associated with anxiety and depression, Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, spina bifida, stroke and traumatic brain injury, especially when associated with diabetic neuropathy. Conclusion: DS is a very frequent problem in neurological diseases, therefore, there is a need for this theme not to be neglected by health professionals, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary treatment.

      "abstract": "El delirio de relacion sensitivo representa un tipo determinado de enferme­ dad o un tipo reactivo paranoico bien caracterizado por su etiologia, sus sintomas y la forma de su evolucion. Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad. Los representantes mas perfilados de este grupo caracterial son individuos complicados, de elevada inteligencia y de gran valor; poseen una sen­ sibilidad fina y profunda, y poseen una etica escrupulosa. Su vida psiquica inte­ riorizada e hipersensible hace que sean presa facil para las pruebas banales de la vida. Ocultan profundamente sus afectos, y los ocultan durante mucho tiempo. Se analizan y se critican con refinamiento. Son muy susceptibles y tenaces, pero",

Scientists include psychological problems related to the development of human intelligence. Intelligence plays a significant role not only in its daily activities, but also in the professional field. Scientists have proved the fact that the success of any activity, the adaptation of a person to the conditions of life, a certain environment, etc., depends on the level of intelligence. Changes in the development of personality intelligence can also be reflected in one’s mental health. One way to solve a person’s psychological problems is to ignore them or to soften the general state of the body.

Sport transitions may be accompanied by changes in identity, interpersonal relationships, schedules, and behavioural changes. Psychosocial outcomes following sport retirement can be broadly differentiated between acute psychological distress, mental health disorders, and healthy adjustment. Acute psychological distress following sport retirement may be best understood in the context of stressful life events. Stressful life events, such as job transitions and family conflict, have been shown to predict the onset of mental health concerns, such as depression. Sport retirement is a significant life event, and negative emotions are a common response to the transition. Adjustment disorder is characterised by the onset of emotional or behavioural symptoms within three months of an identifiable stressor and does not persist past six months after termination of the stressor.",

      "title": "Clinical Holistic Medicine: Mental Disorders in a Holistic Perspective",
      "abstract": "From a holistic perspective, psychiatric diseases are caused by the patients unwillingness to assume responsibility for his life, existence, and personal relations. The loss of responsibility arises from the repression of the fundamental existential dimensions of the patients. Repression of love and purpose causes depersonalization (i.e., a lack of responsibility for being yourself and for the contact with others, loss of direction and purpose in life). Repression of strength in mind and emotions leads to derealization (the breakdown of the reality testing, often with mental delusions and hallucinations). The repression of joy and gender leads to devitalization (emotional emptiness, loss of joy, personal energy, sexuality, and pleasure in life).The losses of existential dimensions are invariably connected to traumas with life-denying decisions. Healing the wounds of the soul by holding and processing will lead to the recovery of the person's character, purpose of life, and existential responsibility. It can be very difficult to help a psychotic patient. The physician must first love his patient unconditionally and then fully understand the patient in order to meet and support the patient to initiate the holistic process of healing. It takes motivation and willingness to suffer on behalf of the patients in order to heal, as the existential and emotional pain of the traumas resulting in insanity is often overwhelming. We believe that most psychiatric diseases can be alleviated or cured by the loving and caring physician who masters the holistic toolbox. Further research is needed to document the effect of holistic medicine in psychiatry.",

Refusal to consider a low-paid job may be considered a result of negativism, grandiose aspirations or lack of insight into one's true functional ability. Squandering one's disability income long before the end of the month might be regarded as an example of poor judgement secondary to psychosis. Liebow's (1967) study of the inner-city poor, however, illustrates that these problems are not specific to people with mental illness but are common responses to poverty and to the work opportunities available to poor people.",

Der Artikel fasst den Wissensstand zu den mit Sexualität verbundenen Verhaltensstörungen zusammen. Generell erschweren das Fehlen klarer Definitionen, ätiologischer Einteilungen und diagnostischer Instrumente die Untersuchung dieser Störungen. Bedingt durch die Heterogenität der Studienpopulationen, Definitionen und Erhebungsmethoden variieren die Prävalenzraten stark (1,8 – 18 %). Ätiologisch werden Dysfunktionen in verschiedenen Hirnbereichen diskutiert. Die Störungen sind bei Männern häufiger als bei Frauen und scheinen bei vaskulären, frontotemporalen und parkinsonassoziierten Demenzen häufiger vorzukommen als bei Alzheimer Demenzen. Die publizierten medikamentösen und nicht medikamentösen Therapiestrategien sind bezüglich der Wirksamkeit unbefriedigend untersucht.",

      "title": "Music Performance Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Abstract Music performance anxiety (MPA) is a pervasive and frequently debilitating difficulty faced by many performers associated with negative impacts on performance quality, psychological distress, deteriorations in confidence, and, at its extreme, disengagement from performing. MPA typically begins early in a musical career and negatively affects performance achievement and career sustainability. Much of the research investigating the vulnerabilities and mechanisms associated with MPA has focused on biological characteristics such as age and gender; psychological characteristics such as trait anxiety, social phobia, and perfectionism; and associated factors such as gender, age, musical genre, and performance context. These factors have been identified as pertinent in predicting and coping with performance anxiety in musicians. This chapter reviews the characteristics and incidence of MPA, and provides a developmental model and treatment modalities, before ending with a summary of practical coping strategies to be used as starting points for musicians at any age or stage.",

Gangguan tidur dapat mengganggu pertumbuhan fisik, emosional, kognitif, dan sosial orang dewasa. Insomnia pada lansia sering terjadi bersama-sama dengan kondisi lain yaitu berupa penyakit-penyakit fisik (hipertiroid, arthritis), penyakit-penyakit jiwa (depresi gangguan kecemasan) yang mengakibatkan seseorang tidak dapat tidur dengan baik. Lansia (lanjut usia) merupakan individu yang mencapai usia 60 tahun ke atas dan berada pada tahap akhir siklus kehidupan. Lansia mengalami proses penuaan yang melibatkan perubahan kumulatif pada tubuhnya, dimana jaringan dan sel-sel tubuhnya mengalami penurunan kapasitas fungsional. Lansia juga rentan terhadap berbagai penyakit atau sindroma karena kemampuan regeneratif tubuhnya yang terbatas dibanding kelompok usia lainnya. Salah satu terapi non- farmakologi yang dapat diterapkan untuk menurunkan insomnia pada lansia adalah dengan terapi dzikir. Terapi dzikir merupakan penanganan non-farmakologi yang dapat bermanfaat bagi lansia dengan insomnia karena tidak memiliki efek samping, dengan mekanisme tersebut dimana dzikir dapat membuat jiwa merasa nyaman dan tentram sehingga dapat mencegah insomnia pada lansia.",

In the majority of palliative care patients, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial and the most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue and history and investigations should always be individualized. Management should initially aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes; however, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered. For optimal management the multidimensional components of fatigue should be assessed and future research is needed on the use of non-pharmacological treatment such as physical activity, counselling, and/or pharmacological agents such as a trial of psychostimulants or short course of corticosteroids.",

      "title": "Sexual dysfunction, depression, and the impact of antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants and can have significant impact on the person’s quality of life, relationships, mental health, and recovery. The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant medication varies considerably between studies, making it difficult to estimate the exact incidence or prevalence. Objectives The focus of this e-poster is to explore the incidence, pathophysiology, and treatment of depression disorder and antidepressant iatrogenic sexual dysfunction. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: depression, sexual disfunction, antidepressant. Results Sexual dysfunction is a common symptom of depression. Although decreased libido is most often reported, difficulties with arousal, resulting in vaginal dryness in women and erectile dysfunction in men, and absent or delayed orgasm are also prevalent. Sexual dysfunction is also a frequent adverse effect of treatment with most antidepressants and is one of the predominant reasons for premature drug discontinuation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most widely prescribed antidepressants and have significant effects on arousal and orgasm compared with antidepressants that target norepinephrine, dopamine, and melatonin systems. The availability of an antidepressant that does not cause or exacerbate sexual dysfunction represents an advance in pharmacotherapy for mood disorders and should reduce treatment noncompliance and decrease the need for switching antidepressants. Conclusions The sexual problems reported range from decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, to erection or delayed ejaculation problems. There are a number of case reports of sexual side effects, such as priapism, painful ejaculation, penile anesthesia, loss of sensation in the vagina and nipples, persistent genital arousal and nonpuerperal lactation in women. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "A new syndrome? The sport identification addiction and the case of Italian football ultra-fanatical support",
      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 has a number of changes to addictions and substance-related disorders. Internet Gaming for instance is a “Condition for Further Study”. This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

A large body of literature within the lifespan developmental psychology tradition offers theoretical and empirical explanations for normal development across the entire lifespan and into old age, but less often focuses on psychopathology. Where the disorder appears to increase or decrease in prevalence compared with earlier points in the lifespan, the chapter evaluates possible explanations for these age-related changes. These disorders include anxiety disorders, mood disorders and suicide, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, personality disorders, sleep disorders, and dementia. Alcohol use disorders are associated with severe mental and physical health consequences and increased risk of mortality.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

La evidencia actual no permite determinar causalidad entre menopausia y ansiedad; algunos factores de riesgo podrian asociarse con psicopatologia. La terapia de remplazo hormonal sola o en combinacion con inhibidores selectivos de la recaptacion de serotonina podria ser efectiva en el control de sintomas psiquiatricos",

      "abstract": "El diagnostico de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) se basa en la presencia obligatoria de bradicinesia y al menos uno de \nlos siguientes sintomas: rigidez muscular, temblor en reposo, o inestabilidad postural. Se ha estimado que la duracion \npromedio de la fase prodromica de la EP es de 10 anos antes de su diagnostico. En la fase prodromica pueden \npresentarse algunos trastornos motores leves, imposibilitando integrar el diagnostico en ausencia de otros sintomas. La \nlatencia diagnostica de la EP es el tiempo transcurrido entre la aparicion del primer sintoma motor hasta el diagnostico \nrealizado por un neurologo. Latencias diagnosticas prolongadas se han asociado significativamente con: iniciar la \nsintomatologia motora con rigidez, trastorno de la marcha o bradicinesia, sufrir un mayor numero de sintomas \nprodromicos no motores, sexo masculino, aparicion temprana de sintomas motores (<40 anos), tener un familiar de \nprimer grado con EP y consultas medicas iniciales con medicos no neurologos. Durante la fase prodromica muchos \npacientes tambien pueden padecer uno o varios de los siguientes sintomas no motores: disfuncion olfatoria, trastorno \nconductual del sueno MOR, depresion, estrenimiento, hipotension ortostatica, somnolencia diurna y disfuncion urinaria \no erectil, entre los cuales los cuatro primeros se han asociado con un mayor riesgo de desarrollar la EP, especialmente si \nse padece mas de uno. Sin embargo, no todos los pacientes con EP reportan haber experimentado alguno de los \nsintomas no motores antes del diagnostico. Estudios futuros permitiran determinar si los sintomas no motores podrian \nusarse para acortar la latencia diagnostica de la EP",

      "abstract": "In recent years, increased attention has been focused on antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction, largely because of the widespread use of serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the recognition that their side-effects can have a negative impact on treatment compliance. Yet the relationship between the depressive illness, the antidepressant medication used to treat it and treatment of emergent sexual dysfunction is complicated and multifactorial. For example, when a depressed man treated with an antidepressant medication seeks treatment for a sexual dysfunction, the clinician is faced with the responsibility of deciphering whether the sexual dysfunction is the result of a pre-existing medical disorder, a symptom of depression or a treatment-emergent adverse effect of antidepressant medication. In order to do this, the clinician needs to be knowledgeable about the salient aspects of normal sexual functioning, and the influences of age, depression and antidepressant medications. In this review, we discuss normal sexual functioning and dysfunction in men, the relationship between depression and sexual functioning, possible mechanisms for SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction and evolving pharmacologic treatment strategies.",

Objective: To establish the medico-legal implications in a case of schizotypical personality disorder that committed homicide. Case presentation: A 22 years old individual, single, without children, technician, without history of mental disorders who is studied by Forensic Psychiatry because he attacked his maternal grandfather with a knife, which caused his death.  Psychiatric examination was done; the Impulsiveness Scale was applied; and an enlectroencephalogram (EEG) and a psychological evaluation were carried out, which included Bender, Machover, and Rorschach tests. The evaluating staff made the diagnosis of Schizotypical disorder, without mental derangement. Conclusions : Schizotypical disorder is not a frequent diagnosis in Psychiatry.  When it is involved in criminal behaviors, they occur in isolation and they are usually related to attacks to other persons.  It is a determinant condition of semi-imputability or imputability.  Prison system is not recommended.

Such evidence is poor also because suicidal patients were systematically excluded from clinical trials, for ethical reasons. Several key ideas are important in the management of the suicidal person. First, the multidimensional assessment of suicidal risk defines the areas of interference with various axis I or axis II disorders, but also with the complex psychosocial environment of such patients. The therapeutic approach must be adapted by taking into account various factors (i.e. gender, age group, degree of social exclusion, etc.). Furthermore, case management must take into account the type of suicidal behavior (acute suicidal crisis or chronic suicidal state), this typology being dependent on the link with axis I disorders, more frequent in acute suicidal crisis, or with disorders belonging axis II, more common in chronic, repetitive suicidal behavior.",

Declining levels of sex steroids (estrogens and androgens) play a major role in the impairment of sexual response; however, psychological and relational changes related with aging and an increase in metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities should also be taken into account. Although first-line therapeutic strategies for menopause-related sexual dysfunction aim at addressing modifiable factors, many hormonal and non-hormonal, local and systemic treatment options are currently available.

Despite the lack of robust scientific data, a number of clinical elements, such as the frequent preoccupation with this type of behavior, the time spent in sexual activities, the continuation of this behavior despite its negative consequences, the repeated and unsuccessful efforts made to reduce the behavior, are in favor of an addictive disorder. In addition there is a high comorbidity between excessive sexual behavior and other addictive behaviors.The phenomenology of excessive nonparaphilic sexual disorder favors its conceptualization as an addictive behavior, rather than an obsessive-compulsive, or an impulse control disorder. Moreover, the criteria that are quite close to those of addictive disorders were recently proposed for the future DSM-V in order to improve the characterization of this condition. Finally, controlled studies are warranted in order to establish clear guidelines for treatment of sexual addiction.",

Further, psychosocial problems often are addressed only superficially or not at all during office visits.

Although the specific cause of schizophrenia remains unknown, research shows that genetics, psychological, social and cultural factors play a role in appearance and development of schizophrenia. Prevalence of schizophrenia is around 1% of the world population. Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10 (ICD-10 or MKB-X) or the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with social rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Usually family members and friends try to convince the patient that they need the treatment which is often seen as a problem since schizophrenic patients more often than not do not have insight of their condition and do not recognise the symptoms that help doctors to diagnose their condition. The improvement of state of schizophrenic person correlates with family members' involvement in the life of schizophrenic person since family members are able to notice causes of negative behaviour and are able to intervene before symptoms of schizophrenia manifest.",

Methods: A MEDLINE search was conducted for English-language articles published over the past 35 years and was supplemented by a search of bibliographies of relevant articles [Compulsive Sexual Behavior, Sexual Addiction, altered sexual preference or Hypersexuality (hetero-, homo-, autosexual)]. Results: Hypersexuality is a change in types and increase in frequency of sexual behaviors. The etiology of hypersexuality is complex and involves a variety of physiological and psychological mechanisms. Frontal lobe dysfunction can lead to disinhibition of sexual behavior and hypersexual behavior. Temporal lobe abnormalities, which have been associated with hypersexuality, also seem to be involved in development of various fetishes, paraphilias, and pedophilia. This sexual behavior may also be the result of other neurologic disorders or a side effect of medications Conclusions: Hypersexuality can be idiopathic or the end result of many underlying disease processes. When the underlying cause may be treated, sexually disinhibited behavior is discontinued. Hypersexuality can cause behaviors in patients that are difficult to manage. But pharmacologic methods can successfully control hypersexual behaviors and paraphilias in most patient population.",

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "abstract": "Acromegaly is a chronic condition caused by the excessive production of growth hormone and is characterized by progressive morphological and systemic complications, as well as increased prevalence of psychopathologies, which markedly affect patients' quality of life. The advancing multimodal therapies, while significantly improving the morbidity and mortality, have limited impact on psychopathologies, which often persist despite disease remission. The most common psychopathologies in acromegaly include depression, anxiety and affective disorders, together with sexual dysfunction, which may be considered as either a consequence or potentially even a contributory factor to these psychopathologies. Approximately one-third of patients with acromegaly manifest depression, whereas two-thirds of patients display anxiety, with both conditions tending to be more prevalent and severe in younger patients with shorter duration of disease. Apparently, a major impact of psychological discomfort in women compared with men appears to be the fact that women tend to internalize whereas men tend to externalize their distress. Personality disorders also commonly associated with acromegaly, especially due to body image suffering, are linked to sexual dysfunction, which seems to affect women more than men. In summary, psychopathology in acromegaly is a major determinant of the quality of life and a complex array of psychological abnormalities are associated with acromegaly.",

      "abstract": "For the clinician caring for patients in some phase of symptomatic HIV disease, patients' current level of adaptation and potential to sustain a sense of well-being are critical. Symptoms of anxiety and depression raise concern, and must be assessed for their severity and enduring qualities. Are these expressions evidence of moods that fluctuate over time even within a given day? Or are they reflective of full-blown syndromes enduring over time? Finally, are these reported and observable symptoms signs of current or imminent psychiatric disorders? Too frequently, episodes of anxiety and depression in persons with life-threatening illness are misdiagnosed where transient moods are given clinical relevance and syndromes are underestimated. Specificity in assessment is needed to derive the most appropriate intervention program. This problem in the context of primary care services to persons with HIV illness can lead to too much concern about temporary distress and minimization of moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression. People with AIDS (PWAs) must cope with multiple complications while anticipating a shortened lifespan. Emotional distress is common and may be organically based, idiopathic, and/or reactive. The relationship of somatic well-being and subjective emotional distress needs attention since the severity of physical debilitation and heightened risk of psychological problems seem to be correlated in this population. Predicting increased anxiety and dysphoric moods at crisis points in the illness draws attention to the role of individuals' cognitive appraisals of their symptoms, judgments of self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies. Symptom severity and perceived control over symptoms are interlocking phenomena capable of influencing emotional distress in these patients.",

      "title": "Adjustment Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals, regardless of their age, are subjected to a significant psychosocial stressor, two possible outcomes are likely—in one instance the person is not significantly affected by the stressor and proceeds on with their life without indication of perceptible problem. In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "title": "What Are Realistic Treatment Goals? Lingering Symptoms Require You to Evaluate Pharmacotherapy and Offer Psychosocial Interventions",
      "abstract": "The course of chronic psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, differs from chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes. Some patients with chronic psychiatric conditions achieve remission and become symptom-free, while others continue to have lingering signs of disease for life. Residual symptoms of schizophrenia are not fully defined in the literature, which poses a challenge because they are central in the overall treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. (1) During this phase of schizophrenia, patients continue to have symptoms after psychosis has subsided. These patients might continue to have negative symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal and low energy. Although frank psychotic behavior has disappeared, the patient might continue to hold strange beliefs. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment option for psychiatric conditions, but the psychosocial aspect may have greater importance when treating residual symptoms and patients with chronic psychiatric illness. (2) A naturalistic study in Germany evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of residual symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. (3) The authors used a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale symptom severity score >1 for those purposes, which is possibly a stringent criterion to define residual symptoms. This multicenter study enrolled 399 individuals age 18 to 65 with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. (3) Of the 236 patients achieving remission at discharge, 94% had at least 1 residual symptom and 69% had at least 4 residual symptoms. Therefore, residual symptoms were highly prevalent in remitted patients. The most frequent residual symptoms were: * blunted affect * conceptual disorganization * passive or apathetic social withdrawal * emotional withdrawal * lack of judgment and insight * poor attention * somatic concern * difficulty with abstract thinking * anxiety * poor rapport. (3) Of note, positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinatory behavior, were found in remitted patients at discharge (17% and 10%, respectively). The study concluded that the severity of residual symptoms was associated with relapse risk and had an overall negative impact on the outcome of patients with schizophrenia. (3) The study noted that residual symptoms may be greater in number or volume than negative symptoms and questioned the origins of residual symptoms because most were present at baseline in more than two-third of patients. Patients with residual symptoms of schizophrenia usually are older and therefore present specific management challenges for clinicians. Changes associated with aging, such as medical problems, cognitive deficits, and lack of social support, could create new care needs for this patient population. Although the biopsychosocial model used to treat chronic psychiatric conditions, especially schizophrenia, is preferred, older schizophrenia patients with residual symptoms often need more psychosocial interventions compared with young adults with schizophrenia. Managing residual symptoms in schizophrenia Few studies are devoted to pharmacological treatment of older adults with schizophrenia, likely because pharmacotherapy for older patients with schizophrenia can be challenging. Evidence-based treatment is based primarily on findings from younger patients who survived into later life. Clinicians often use the adage of geriatric psychiatry, start low, go slow, because older patients are susceptible to adverse effects associated with psychiatric medications, including cardiovascular, metabolic, anticholinergic, and extrapyramidal effects, orthostasis, sedation, falls, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Older patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and anticholinergic adverse effects, perhaps because of degeneration of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. …",

      "abstract": "Pain relief is a significant determinant of quality of life for cancer survivors. However, effective pain management is often complicated by the multiple determinants of the chronic pain experience. For a minority of survivors, nociceptive or neuropathic pain may develop or persist following a pain-free interval of variable duration despite apparent recovery of damaged tissue and continued disease-free status. Additionally, survivors may also suffer from other chronic pain conditions that may have been acquired before or after the cancer diagnosis and treatment. The experience of chronic pain often has deleterious effects on sexual functioning, related either to the noxious stimulus of pain or as a negative consequence of pain management. Common pharmacological approaches and interventional techniques utilized in the treatment of pain have documented effects on sexual functioning. Current treatment strategies offer varying degrees of symptom resolution. Future research is needed to examine the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of chronic pain and medications for pain management on sexual function. Further research is also needed to address the efficacy of treatment options, including combining medical interventions with sexual counseling in the treatment of sexual disorders.",

The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

In this brief overview, the normal biology of sexual function is outlined, together with the central and peripheral underlying chemical mechanisms. Knowledge of the normal biology of sexual function, along with knowledge of the mechanism of action of different drugs, helps one to predict whether a medication might cause sexual problems. Psychotropic drugs in particular can have both short- and long-term effects on sexual function, depending on length of exposure to an individual agent. This contribution provides an overview of those drugs which are most likely to be associated with sexual dysfunction, including not only prescribed medication but also recreational drugs and those commonly used by patients with mental health problems. The contribution ends with an outline of the management of drug-induced sexual side effects.",

Recent findings The differences and/or similarities between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome have not been studied, conceptually or empirically. The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

      "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection for satisfactory sexual performance. The prevalence of ED has been estimated as nearly 40% of men >40 years of age1 although these figures are contested.2 ED increases in frequency with age and is estimated to affect 15% of men aged 40–50 years, 45% of men in their 60s and 70% of men older than 70 years.3 Successful erection is a complex system involving reflex action (peripheral nerves and spinal cord), the limbic system (psychogenic stimuli) and the release of nitric oxide. Adequate levels of testosterone are required, and hence an intact hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular axis. Hence, ED can result from disease or treatment that produces hormonal deficiency, neurological impairment, problems with penile blood flow, disorders of tissue mechanics, psychological factors or any combination of these.\n\nLogically, ED secondary to testosterone deficiency should be treated by testosterone replacement. Testosterone levels in men decrease with age.4 Both epidemiological and observational studies have demonstrated that reduced testosterone is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. One meta-analysis showed lower testosterone and higher 17β oestradiol as significant risk predictors despite adjustment for age and body mass index.4 Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have been found to have lower testosterone levels than controls, and there is inverse correlation between testosterone and the incidence of major cardiovascular disease (CVD).4 A significant negative correlation has been reported between total testosterone levels and Framingham risk score.4 However, it has been pointed out that ‘It is unclear if this is a causal association or due to low testosterone being a biomarker of poor health’.4 Testosterone replacement as a treatment for …",

Besides many reasons causing poor sexual performance, like mental condition itself, medication can alter one's ability to achieve satisfaction in sex. Sexual dysfunction is listed among one of side effects of psychotropic medications. Aim of this work is to determine an influence of pharmacotherapy on sexual function in patients with bipolar disorder. &#x0D; Results: Pharmacotherapy in patients suffering from bipolar disorder can cause a multitude of side effects, including malfunction in sexual performance. Extent of severity in poor sexual life depends on many factors among which are: type of drug taken, whether there are one or more drugs taken at the same time. Seems to be observed that quetiapine shows the least negative effect on sexual performance. Additionally, highest risk of sexual malfunction is observed in patients with polytherapy. &#x0D; Conclusion: Besides topics investigated in the following research, there are additional factors like duration and severity of the disease, gender and age. There are many variables needed to be taken into consideration, but there is potential of choosing proper medication for a patient with least possible side effects and to allow them to perform more successful sex life, which directly corresponds with better quality of life.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Behavioral and emotional disorders are highly prevalent and heterogeneous common disorders in children and adolescents that include attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, depression and others. These disorders are frequently associated with the negative outcomes in adulthood, substance abuse and dependence, early pregnancy, persistent health problems, increased aggression, impulsivity, hyperactivity, inattention, obsessions, compulsions, anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, and criminality. These disorders are multifactorial and heterogeneous, with a complex etiology and strong genetic component. No single deficit is sufficient to explain all clinical cases of these disorders. Various child-specific, environmental, demographic, psychosocial, psychiatric, cognitive, developmental and genetic factors, with the stress exposure or adverse early life experiences, and a complicated interplay of these factors, contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorders and antisocial, violent and suicidal behaviors. The neurobiological basis of these disorders is not clear, but it is assumed to involve particular gene mutations and altered functions of the main neurotransmitter (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin /5-HT/) and neuroendocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) systems. Materials and Methods: Platelet markers, monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and 5-HT, and polymorphisms of the genes for catechol-o- methyl-transferase (COMT) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined in male and female children with depression, OCD, ADHD, and phobias. Children were further subdivided according to the gender and suicidal behavior. Clinical diagnoses and suicidal behavior were assessed according to the DSM-IV criteria, different clinical scales and the psychiatric interview. Results: Significant differences were found in platelet 5-HT concentration between healthy boys and girls, but not among suicidal and non-suicidal children. Significant differences in the frequency of the Val66Met BDNF genotypes between suicidal, non-suicidal and healthy groups were detected. The distribution of the Val158/108Met COMT variants, and platelet MAO-B activity, did not differ significantly between the studied groups. Discussion: Our results did not support the hypothesis that reduced platelet 5-HT concentration or lower platelet MAO-B activity or Val158/108Met COMT variants present the risk factors for suicidal behavior in children. The significant contribution of the Met/Val genotype of the Val66Met BDNF to the observed significance suggested that Val66Met BDNF might present a risk factor for suicidal behavior. This result should be confirmed on the larger sample. Since the clinical features of behavioral and emotional disorders are heterogeneous and complex, further research of the risk factors for suicidal behavior is important to identify and properly treat children and adolescents prone to suicidal behavior, in order to prevent suicidal behavior, suicidal attempts and completed suicides.",

      "abstract": "Medication adherence is increasingly being recognized as a significant issue in treating geriatric patients. A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy. Health literacy has emerged as an important factor that affects older persons' capacity, for example, to make health care choices.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic factors pertinent to medication adherence include whether patients have insurance or other financial resources to pay for the medication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients' relationship with their physician as well as the physician's communication style can affect adherence.5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the older adult with memory problems, we have found that whether patients depend on themselves or a caregiver can have a significant impact on adherence.6 Not all caregivers take responsibility for a patient's medication, and family members' beliefs about a medication can also affect the patient's adherence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation of elders' medication adherence as a factor in treatment success or failure is thus potentially complex, difficult, and time consuming.",

They are associated with a decline in overall health status and perception of poor health and can have negative personal and social consequences. The term insomnia is defined in different ways and can describe a symptom and/or a disorder. It involves dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality and is associated with one or more of the following subjective complaints like difficulty with sleep initiation, difficulty maintaining sleep, or early morning waking with inability to return to sleep. In DSM- V ‘Insomnia Disorder’ is described under the heading of ‘Sleep-Wake Disorders’. It classifies insomnia under an umbrella term “insomnia disorders” where both primary and secondary insomnia are combined. In this paper the new and updated diagnostic criteria of Insomnia Disorder along with its etiology, pathophysiology and consequences will be discussed in detail.",

These conditions are illnesses or impairments that are expected to last for an extended period of time and require medical attention and care that is above and beyond what would normally be expected for a child or adolescent of the same age, extensive hospitalization, or in-home health services.1 These conditions include, among others, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, spina bifida, hemophilia, seizure disorders, neuromuscular disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and congenital heart diseases. Although each specific condition may be relatively or extremely rare, when they are considered together, many children and adolescents are affected. Health conditions may be characterized by their duration and their severity. Although these terms are often linked, they refer to different aspects of a health condition. A chronic condition is generally one that has lasted or is expected to last more than a defined period of time, usually 3 months or longer. Conditions vary widely in their onset, course, and duration.2 Severity refers to the impact a condition has on a child's physical, intellectual, psychological, or social functioning.3 This impact may occur as a result of persistent symptoms, required treatments, limitations of activity or mobility, or interference with school, recreation, work, and family activities. Current estimates are that between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment. Most of these conditions are relatively mild and interfere little with the children's ability to participate in usual childhood activities.4 However.",

      "title": "Aging, Disability and Frailty",
      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

Case Presentation: A 25-year-old woman presented with complaints that the skin over the vagina is retracting inside her body and feeling that something will happen to her if it gets fully retracted for 9 months. She had multiple consultations with the gynecologist who found no anatomical abnormality on examination and referred the patient to a psychiatrist, where she was diagnosed with Koro syndrome and was started on psychotropic medication. Conclusion: Female with Koro syndrome is expressed mainly in an epidemic setting due to cultural and psycho-social factors such as cultural taboos that suppress the expression of atypical sexual symptoms, inadequate knowledge, and misconceptions.",

ED can be distinguished as a pure psychogenic, organic and mixed disorder (4) .Potency is the ability to attain and maintain a functional /rigid erection and is best characterized by axial rigidity rather than hemodynamic parameter (5-7). Some clinical studies have shown that potency is not always associated with normal hemodynamics or vice-versa Therefore other factors may also be responsible for rigid erection. This disparity between penile rigidity and hemodynamic erectile response is because of expandability of erectile tissue as described by Udelson et al -(6-8) . Thus Impotence may occur in some patient solely on the basis of abnormal penile tissue property despite normal hemodynamics.",

However, such declines must not be accepted as indisputable evidence that the learning efficiency of older adults is necessarily impaired. Cognitive factors such as a production deficiency in long‐term memory and/or a retrieval deficiency do operate to depress the performance of older adults. However, a number of noncognitive factors such as functional and pathological sensory deficits, psychomotor slowing, poor physical and mental health, and insufficient or excessively high motivation also mitigate against optimal performance in the aged. The learning efficiency of the aged may be improved through the use of teaching and learning techniques designed to compensate for the negative effects of both detrimental cognitive and noncognitive factors.",

Disorders of desire and arousal, particularly lubrication problems, continue to be the most commonly reported problems in community surveys, no twith standing the recent increase in interest in organic causes.A womans psychological state, beliefs, expectations, tastes, and surroundings all influence her sexual attraction.

      "abstract": "Las enfermedades cronicas, ademas de requerir de un adecuado diagnostico, necesitan una permanente adherencia al tratamiento para lograr la modificacion del estilo de vida. La hipertension arterial es asintomatica, razon por la cual el paciente desconoce la severidad de la misma, constituyendose en un factor de riesgo para la salud. Esta enfermedad cardiovascular esta asociada a diversos factores psicologicos, como el estres, la ansiedad, depresion, hostilidad, ira y bajos niveles de apoyo social. Para el tratamiento de esta patologia, se requiere un proceso de implicacion activa por parte del paciente denominado adherencia terapeutica, que le permite al diagnosticado seguir las recomendaciones y adquirir habitos beneficiosos; la falta de adherencia es una de las principales causas del bajo control de la presion arterial. Existen factores que interfieren en este proceso como son: a. los derivados del paciente (psicologicos): ansiedad, estres, trastornos del estado de animo y rasgos de personalidad tipo a, b. los del entorno socio-economico y cultural (apoyo inadecuado), c. los de la enfermedad (asintomatologia y cronicidad) y d. los del tratamiento farmacologico, servicios de salud y personal que atiende al paciente.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl presente articulo tiene como objetivo, establecer la relacion entre los factores psicosociales y las estrategias de afrontamiento empleadas por los pacientes con enfermedad oncologica. Para lo cual se realiza una juiciosa revision teorica respecto a los desarrollos investigativos y textos que definan y permitan ver una actualizacion del concepto de enfermedad oncologica, factores psicosociales y estrategias de afrontamiento. finalmente se encuentra que existen factores psicosociales como el apoyo social y la informacion brindada por el personal medico, que hacen parte fundamental del empleo de estrategias de afrontamiento adaptativas por parte de los pacientes, entre las que se encuentran, espiritu de lucha, evitacion y/o escape, reevaluacion positiva y pensamiento racional. \r\n\r\n\r\nEl presente articulo hace una revision bibliografica acerca de los antecedentes teoricos e investigativos que permiten establecer una relacion entre el cancer ginecologico como enfermedad y el impacto psicologico derivado de este, en relacion a los efectos generados en la maternidad, como resultado de los tratamientos tanto quirurgicos como farmacologicos y producidos por la enfermedad, comprendiendo el impacto psicologico desde las exigencias socioculturales e individuales frente a la identidad femenina y las alteraciones emocionales que desencadena la infertilidad.",

      "title": "Genetic and Environmental Factors in Autism",
      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

      "title": "MENTAL HEALTH AND BONE REGENERATION",
      "abstract": "Mental trauma can be caused by single or multiple traumatic events during lifetime or by long-lasting psychological and/or psychosocial stress. Especially chronic stress is a major burden of modern life and poses a clear risk factor for a plethora of somatic and psychiatric disorders. A role of the immune system in the development of stress-associated somatic and psychiatric disorders is very likely, given that: i) both stress-associated somatic and mental disorders go along with a dysregulated and over-reacting immune system; ii) risk factors for mental disorders promote immune hyper-reactivity to psychosocial stress and iii) chronic psychosocial stress induces chronic low-grade inflammation in healthy individuals. Because bone and especially bone regeneration are highly influenced by osteoimmunological mechanisms, we hypothesized that chronic stress and mental health problems might be associated with disturbances in bone homeostasis and healing. We investigated that in various preclinical models for chronic psychosocial stress during pregnancy, childhood or during adulthood. We found that stress during pregnancy induced an osteopenic bone phenotype in male offspring only, while early life stress induced a mild osteocatabolic phenotype in female mice only. In contrast, chronic adult stress did not affect the bones of female mice, while male mice displayed reduced long bone length and disturbed endochondral ossification. Because endochondral ossification is also important for secondary fracture healing, we investigated the effects of chronic adult stress on bone regeneration in male mice. Indeed, we found a disturbed inflammatory response towards fracture with increased number of catecholamine-producing neutrophils in the fracture hematoma. This led to reduced endochondral ossification and thereby contributing to disturbed bone regeneration. In conclusion, we could show that chronic stress during various phases of life might affect bone health in a sex-dependent manner and might also interfere with bone regeneration. Molecular mechanisms might be a dysregulated immune system and thereby osteoimmunological crosstalks.",

A concussion is a complex pathophysiologic process, with or without loss of consciousness, that results in a disturbance of brain function. Risk factors include age &lt;18 years, female sex, and history of a previous concussion. A sideline physical examination with standardized assessment tools can assist diagnosis. Management for suspected concussion begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest. A stepwise return-to-play protocol, taking into consideration state laws, with a gradual increase in activity until the athlete is able to perform full activity without symptoms should be followed. Neuropsychologic testing may be used as a tool in management. For prolonged concussion, physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbance may be required. Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in prevention. The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.",

The etiology of this illness is unlikely to be a single agent. Findings to date suggest that physiological and psychological factors work together to predispose and perpetuate the illness. Diagnosis is made difficult by the nonspecific clinical findings and no available diagnostic testing. With no known cause or cure for the chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome, treatment is based on relieving symptoms and improving the quality of life of affected patients. There is emerging evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome may be familial. In the future, studies will examine the extent to which genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of chronic fatigue syndrome. Most patients with CFS have psychiatric problems such as a generalized anxiety disorder, or major or minor depression, therefore, these mental health disorders may be correlated with the pathophysiology of the CFS. The treatment for CFS must be individualized, due to the heterogeneity of the CFS population. Also the treatment of CFS is built on a foundation of patient-physician relationship, respect and advocacy.",

Studi literatur ini menggunakan metode pencarian artikel penelitian dalam database jurnal PubMed dan Google Scholar. Ada 6 jurnal yang menyatakan sikap berdiri lama berhubungan signifikan dengan NPB, namun 2 jurnal lainnya menyatakan sebaliknya. Sikap berdiri lama yang melebihi 20 menit dapat memberikan stress pada otot posterior tubuh dan persendian columna vertebralis, terutama di regio lumbal yang dapat menimbulkan keluhan NPB dengan tingkat dan kualitas nyeri yang bervariasi. Adanya faktor pekerjaan seperti beban kerja, lama kerja, sikap kerja, bantuan alat, dan banyaknya jam istirahat, serta faktor personal, seperti usia, merokok, jenis kelamin dan IMT, dapat ikut mempengaruhi kemunculan NPB pada seseorang, sehingga seseorang yang memiliki masa kerja yang lebih lama beresiko lebih besar mengalami keluhan NPB daripada seseorang yang memiliki masa kerja baru. Faktor-faktor ini dapat berpotensi memberikan bias pada hasil penelitian apabila tidak dipersiapkan dengan cermat.",

      "title": "THE PHENOMENON OF UNCERTAINTY IN SOMATIC DISEASES",
      "abstract": "Uncertainty is often viewed as negative or anxious and formative state of stress. Nevertheless uncertainty itself reflects a neutral cognitive state and is neither a desirable nor a fearful state until its consequences are determined. People evaluate the situation and thereby set a vector of uncertainty, viewing it as a positive or negative event associated with opportunity or threat. Uncertainty caused by ambiguous, contradictory information about the disease with unclear, insufficient data for prognosis increases the distress of patients with somatic diseases and negatively affects their quality of life. Аt the same time, with negative dynamics of the disease, patients can maintain a certain level of uncertainty to preserve their existing emotional well-being. The article discusses the conditions that contribute to the emergence of uncertainty, factors influencing the manifestation of this phenomenon, as well as assessment mechanisms and coping strategies involved in the process of patients’ adaptation to new functioning conditions. Patients' assessment of events under conditions of uncertainty affects the formation of their internal picture of the disease, emotional state, psychosocial adaptation and adherence to treatment. Among the prognostic factors of non-adherence to treatment, there are areas related to the patient, treatment, interaction between the patient and the doctor, and the healthcare system, which to varying degrees have various aspects of uncertainty [1]. The presented results of the international practical studies confirm the influence of uncertainty on the emotional state and mental well-being, the extent of distress, the manifestation of anxiety and depression, the use of various coping strategies, the quality of life of patients with various nosologies, which permits to make an assumption about the obligatory manifestation of this phenomenon in one form or another during illness. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to this phenomenon, study its manifestations and take it into account in the providing psychological assistance to patients in the process of coping with the disease and treatment.",

Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability.

They are classified into four major categories: (1) sexual desire disorders, (2) sexual arousal disorders, (3) orgasmic disorders, and (4) sexual pain disorders.MEDLINE files from 1966 to the present were searched using the specific sexual dysfunctions as key words along with the general key word \"sexual dysfunction\" to review the published literature. Additional articles came from the reference lists of dysfunction-specific reviews.The key to diagnosis often rests on the physician's willingness to raise the issue with patients. A rational protocol can be followed to identify causative organic and psychogenic factors using the psychosexual and medical history, a comprehensive physical examination, psychological assessment instruments, laboratory tests, and special procedures. Current psychological treatment includes one or more of the following components: sensate focus exercises, cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation training, hypnosis and guided imagery, and group therapies. Specific techniques, such as directed self-stimulation, the stop-start and squeeze techniques, the sexological examination, systematic desensitization, and Kegel exercises, are added therapy when appropriate. Marital therapy to improve communication and resolve conflict is also part of standard therapy. Medical management can include pharmacologic agents to correct endocrine dysfunctions or to alter the progression of the sexual response. Surgical management can involve arterial revascularization, venous ligation, and penile implants. A noninvasive vacuum constriction device is also used to treat erectile disorders. The long-term prognosis of the sexual dysfunctions varies with the type of disorder and its causes. Generally good results (80 to 95 percent satisfaction) are obtained when treating vaginismus, dyspareunia, male erectile disorders, and female orgasmic dysfunctions. Long-term results are modestly successful (40 to 80 percent) when treating inhibited male orgasm and premature ejaculation. Long-term success is poorest at present for treating sexual desire disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "title": "Paternal perinatal depression: underestimation of the disorder, its clinical and classificatory entanglements, and therapeutic alternatives",
      "abstract": "In the perinatal period, fathers may also suffer from depression, referred to as paternal perinatal depression. Studies have shown that the prevalence of paternal perinatal depression is considerably higher than in the general adult population. For example, a meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression among fathers was 9.76% during the prenatal period and 8.75% during the postpartum year.1 Paternal perinatal depression can deteriorate the marital relationship and generate psychosocial and behavioral problems in the offspring (Ramchandani et al., 2021).2 However, paternal perinatal depression has received comparatively little clinical attention. A review of the literature on this subject will list the biological, psychological and social risk factors for this condition, which include a history of depression or anxiety disorders, lack of social support, conflicts in the couple's relationship, economic and labor problems. The clinical characteristics of depression share similarities with depressions in other periods of life, and there are differential clinical features, such as anger, aggressiveness, somatic symptoms and greater comorbidity with substance abuse disorder. Early detection with scales such as the Edinburgh, Gotland and PAPA and the appropriate approach are fundamental to mitigate the effects of paternal perinatal depression. Psychotherapeutic support, psychoeducation of the disorder, and self-care tools can be part of a comprehensive approach to help parents experiencing this condition. In conclusion, the proposal to include this disorder within the parental perinatal affective disorders, as proposed by the author Baldoni,3 given the level of overlap that it usually has with other comorbid conditions (anxiety, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders) and high frequency of masked symptoms, goes in the direction to give the attention it deserves for early detection and provide adequate support and treatment.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

      "abstract": "Aging is inevitably associated with a large number of body functions including the mental health. In addition to that, heart function, emotions, moods etc. could be mentioned as the results of gradual aging. Such conditions are usually accompanied with increase in medications consumption and decline in quality of life. Though usually medical sciences study mental health conditions, sociology also needs to be applied to appraise the \"cause and effect\" of mental health. As life expectancy is globally increasing, more and more people are subject to mental disorders, Alzheimer's disorders, dementia, depression and many more, as the effects of aging extensively impact mental health. Therefore, under the conditions of rapid aging, geriatrics needs to be strengthened and improved as much as possible to safeguard mental health. However, structural changes in terms of biological, physical, psychological and chemical reactions which inevitably occur with aging, need prevention and appropriate medication, and other investments in long term, and if not, other vulnerabilities will inevitably appear.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A person with schizophrenia is more prone to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) when compared to the general population. Schizo-obsessive disorder is diagnosed when a person has schizophrenia with co-existing OCD or OCS. It is associated with depressive symptoms, no definitive diagnostic criteria and has poor response to polypharmacotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old-man with no significant family history and symptoms suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia, was on intermittent treatment for 6 years. Since the past one year, he also had OCS and depressive symptoms – constantly checking himself if he passed stools, reduced appetite, disturbed sleep, suicidal thoughts. He has multiple hospital visits where they have changed the anti-psychotics and their dosage, given electro-convulsive therapy, but couldn’t be relieved of his symptoms. He was started on high dose antipsychotics of two different classes and serotonin agonists, but still did not improve. CONCLUSION: Schizo-obsessive disorder is a diagnostic difficulty to the clinician, reported to have poor prognosis. It significantly affects one’s general, social and occupational functioning. Research is required on its psychopathology, treatment protocols and its diagnostic criteria is yet to be established. Antidepressant, depression, insight, internalized stigma",

      "abstract": "An initial prodromal condition was shown for about 75% of first-episode psychosis patients, lasting five years on average, possessing pathological significance and leading to psychosocial disruptions. Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms. This review will outline the current state of the art of a phase specific early detection and intervention based on these syndromes.",

PE is poorly defined and inadequately characterized, therefore, professionals find it difficult to cope with the diagnosis, treatment and research. Men who complain about their PE also describe their problem in different ways.This article describes the prevalence of PE, presents the different definitions of the problem and provides a model for evaluation and treatment combining medical and psychosexual techniques.The proposed model for the diagnosis and treatment of PE was composed by combining information from relevant literature with the multi-professional staff experience in our Sexual Medicine Center.Selective serotonin release inhibitors (SSRIs) have been the most promising medication for treatment of PE. Psychosexual therapy, offering cognitive-behavioral techniques contribute to the man's ability to improve his sexual and couple relationships.Diagnosis of PE is mainly based on sexual history as described by the male patient. Therefore, it is essential to have a comprehensive medical and sexual history, description of the effect of PE on sexual activity, and the degree of personal and couple distress. It is important to clarify the onset of the problem, as PE may be the result of another sexual dysfunction of the man or his sexual partner.",

It is the manifestation of one or more physical symptoms accompanied by excessive thoughts, emotion, and/or behavior related to the symptom, which causes significant distress and/or dysfunction. These symptoms may or may not be explained by a medical condition. The two major changes to the DSM-IV criteria included eliminating the requirement that somatic symptoms be organically unexplained and adding the requirement that certain psychobehavioral features have to be present to justify the diagnosis. The new criteria also eliminated somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder from the previous definitions. These revisions were intended to increase the relevance of SSD and its use in the primary care setting.",

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved. In the research the academically definitions and the clinical case descriptions of the following clinical phenomena were estimated: Conversion, obsession, neurasthenia, phobia, derealisation/depersonalization, anxiety (partly specific for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders); True hallucinations, confusion, amnesia, fixation hypomnesia, anecphoria (partly specific for organic mental disorders); Pseudo hallucinations, delusion of control, automatism, paralogia, emotional withdrawal, autism, ambivalence (common symptoms of schizophrenia); Inability to feel, sadness, lassitude, euphoria, excitement as the signs of endogenous affective disorders.

In addition, modifying psychological and social factors are discussed.Older adults appear to be at greater risk for major depression biologically, such as depression resulting from vascular changes, yet the frequency of depression is lower compared to younger adults. Older adults may be protected psychologically due to factors such as socio-emotional selectivity and wisdom, compared to younger adults, and perhaps relatively protected from social risks.A biopsychosocial approach to evaluating the origins of late-life depression is heuristically valuable, a continual reminder of the many factors that contribute to the onset and persistence of clinically significant symptoms in late life.",

For conceptual clarity, it is helpful to consider that there are different ways in which emotional factors can exert an influence on the course of any illness. Several of these factors are briefly described as follows: 1. Occasionally the emotional state or set of attitudes of the patient may be reflected in his inability or unwillingness to cooperate with the therapeutic regimen prescribed for him. This difficulty may be encountered, of course, in every degree of severity ranging from mildly annoying uncooperativeness to defiance of medical advice with tragic consequences. Such help-rejecting behavior may stem from a variety of psychological roots. For example,",

The negative consequences include school failure, psychiatric problems, substance abuse, self-harm, suicide attempts, increased risk of being physically and sexually maltreated, and unplanned/unwanted pregnancies. Chronic pain, overweight and sleep problems/disorders are also common. The symptom presentation is one with fewer obvious hyperactive and impulsive behaviours as compared with boys. Attention deficits, emotional dysregulation and verbal aggression are more common. Many more girls are now being diagnosed with ADHD than 20 years ago, but ADHD symptoms in girls are still quite often overlooked, and underdiagnosis is more common than in boys. Girls with ADHD are less often receiving pharmacological treatment for equally impairing symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. There is a need for more studies of ADHD in girls and women, awareness among professionals and the general public needs to be increased, focused support in schools needs to be implemented and better intervention methods need to be developed.",

It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

It is a fairly common problem in paediatric age: approximately 1 child out of 5 is affected at 5 years of age, with a potential significant impact on their quality of life and family. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

      "abstract": "this is a matter of isolated damage such as amnesia syndrome or if this is a case of diffuse damages that are characteristic of dementia.It is also important to differentiate confusing state from dementia.Confusing state is characterized by acute or sub-acute beginning, fluctuating course with consciousness disturbance, attention deficit, increased psychomotorics, common reversibility lasting for several days or weeks, whereas dementia has a slow start, progressive course without disturbance of consciousness and without distraction lasting a few months or years accompanied by irreversibility.Dementias are acquired, generalized and most frequently progressive disorders of cognitive functions that include intelligence, learning and memory, speech, problem solving, orientation, perception, attention, concentration, judgement and social abilities.Strong personality damages can also occur.They are diagnosed if impairment of cognitive functions disturbs work and social functioning of a person and shows a deterioration from the previous level of functioning.In diagnostics along with common neurological testing it is crucial to test cognitive status involving examination of memory, attention, speech functions, sensory and motor functions as well as integrative functions.Clinically, dementias are manifested by changes in cognition, fatigue, difficulties in planning and performing tasks, personality changes, behavioural changes.Demented patients are prone to detailed and extensive retelling, anger, sarcasm, pathetic expression of the face, aggression and emotional instability.The disease ultimately causes complete disability and such persons require adequate care.Dementia is not exclusively related to the geriatric age, but it may also occur earlier with diseases that alter brain function.Causes of dementia may be different.The so-called \"memo-VITAMINS test\" is applied and it indicates possible causes of dementia; these are vascular, infectious, toxic-metabolic, autoimmune, metastatic, androgenic, neurodegenerative and systemic causes.The most frequent is Alzheimer's dementia followed by a large group of dementias associated with parkinsonism involving dementia related to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewis relapses.[3] Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system; it is the most common type of dementia occurring in 5% of patients over the age of 50 and in 50% of patients over 80 years of age.It is also the most common cause of dementia in persons older than 65 years.The first and dominant disease symptom is a memory disorder along with disorders of speech function, praxies, gnostics and executive functions.The consequence is emergence of disturbances in three key areas of life: in daily life activities, behaviour and personality as well as cognitive functions. 1,2",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Although many studies have been published on the subject, only some used a validated sexual function rating scale and most lacked either a baseline or placebo control or both. In addition, many of the studies on sexual dysfunction associated with antipsychotic medication are limited by other methodological flaws. However, there is consistent evidence to suggest that a large number of antipsychotic drugs adversely affect one or more of the 3 phases of sexual response (desire, arousal and orgasm). Among the antipsychotics, the so called \"prolactin-raising\" are probably most associated with sexual dysfunction, even if further studies to confirm this are needed: the reviewed literature shows no consistent evidence that any one antipsychotic drug has a significantly superior side effect profile over another and current information on this topic is often based on methodologically weak research. Clinicians must be aware of drug-induced sexual dysfunction, since its presence can have important consequences for clinical management and compliance.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

However, it can considerably reduce motivation to the treatment, overcoming the illness, increase the risk of suicidal behavior and in general worsen the quality of their life. Manifestations of the depressed mood of cancer patients are similar to manifestations of the depressed mood of the patients having chronic or deadly diseases. However, there are features which depend on some factors, the most important of which is the disease stage. The results obtained allow to draw a conclusion that the features of the depressed mood at the second stage of the disease are connected with acceptation of the diagnosis and can manifest in the feeling of a punishment expectation, loss of interests in previous hobbies and communication restrictions; the features of a depressed mood at the third stage are determined by the disease dynamics and the further forecast, and can manifest in the analysis of the previous mistakes, absence of of hopes for the future, disgust for themselves and feeling of uselessness.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

      "abstract": "Sexual health is often negatively affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but rarely discussed between patients and health care professionals. Experienced reasons for decreased sexual health vary among patients, but pain, stiffness, reduced mobility, fatigue and negative feelings towards one9s own body are common factors. In addition to negative effects experienced to be due to RA, there are also negative influences on sexual health by other factors, such as insufficient physical activity, low self-esteem, depression and stressful influences in life. Physiotherapy is a common intervention for patients with RA and patients have reported improved sexual health due to physiotherapy. Regular physiotherapy interventions for patients with RA often include coaching towards increasing physical activity levels, hydrotherapy, pain reductive treatment and mobility exercises, both individually and in groups. The physiotherapy interventions leading to improved sexual health (according to patients with RA) has been regular interventions for patients with RA and not specifically aimed at enhancing sexual health. The patients do seldom describe that the physiotherapist has informed them of how physiotherapy might enhance sexual health, but they have themselves experienced how physiotherapy has improved their sexual life. Patients describe that they experience joy, increased self-esteem and a more positive approach to their body, when participating in physiotherapy and that this positive feeling is affecting their life, including their sexual life. They also describe how increased physical capacity reduces fatigue and increases their capacity to engage in valued life activities, including sexual activities. The way that the physiotherapist can further enhance sexual health, is by informing the patient of how sexual health is linked to experienced symptoms of RA and how physiotherapy interventions, for example increasing physical activity, can enhance also sexual health. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

      "abstract": "Five pre-school children with variability in the quality of their social relationships, unusual or abnormal speech and/or expressive language, and ritualistic or manneristic behaviors, were diagnosed as having an atypical pervasive developmental disorder. In order to study the natural history of this disorder these children were followed-up 10 years later. Four of the adolescents showed evidence of the persistence of social and communicative disorders consistent with a diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder (PDDNOS), while one was found to have a social phobia and the residual state of the PDDNOS. One of the PDD adolescents was actively psychotic. We find that young children diagnosed as having a pervasive developmental disorder with atypical features can have thinking disorders and/or poor reality testing which persists into adolescence, and can develop symptoms of childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. The overall cognitive functioning of young children diagnosed as having a pervasive developmental disorder with atypical features tends to be stable or perhaps even improve somewhat as they grow into adolescence. Parents are aware of, and can report, the presence of severe emotional and/or behavioral disturbance in such adolescents. The marked similarities in symptomatology, clinical course, and treatment histories, between this group and a group of adolescents who were not diagnosed as having a PDD until adolescence, suggests that there may be an underreporting or underdiagnosis of young children with pervasive developmental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Motivation literally means 'to be driven to do something' and refers to processes dealing with the origin and maintenance of the target behavior. Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

      "title": "Management of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 35-year-old married woman with an obsessive compulsive disorder. She had a 21-year history of obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors including compulsive checking which had become persistent since the birth of her first child. There is no evidence of comorbidity, except for a mild generalized anxiety disorder. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common chronic, and disabling disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive and distressing thoughts, images, or impulses. Compulsions are repetitive, intentional behaviors that the person feels compelled to perform, often with a desire to resist. Compulsions are typically intended to avert some fear event or to reduce distress. These symptoms are ego-dystonic and cause significant distress to patients and their families. OCD is among the most common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2.3% [1]. It is almost equally distributed between males and females.OCD often begins in adolescence or early adulthood usually with a gradual onset. However, a rapid onset of symptoms may occur, sometimes associated with a traumatic event, such as pregnancy or loss. Actually, recent literature suggests that pregnancy may precipitate OCD in individuals [2, 3], as in our case report. It appears that patients who reported the onset or worsening of OCD symptoms in pregnancy developed fear of harming the fetus or child [3, 4]. However, in our case report, the patient's preoccupations deal with responsibility for her child's health (e.g. 'my son will choke to death with his blanket if I don't check'): the patient does not fear being responsible for any harm coming to her son. Due to the secretive nature of the disorder, there is often a delay of more than 10 years before patients come to specialty settings [5]. The trouble is usually long, with most patients experiencing a chronic course, while others experience a fluctuating one [6].Patients with both obsessions and compulsions constitute a large proportion of affected patients. OCD can be expressed through many different symptoms. The classical presentation includes obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors of washing and/or checking. Another pattern is one with merely intrusive obsessional thoughts, without compulsion (table 1).OCD can be severely incapacitating: depression is the most common complication and the symptoms can spread to interfere with the patient's social and occupational functioning, often involving the entire family.The case report thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or psychiatric unit. The patient meets the criteria for OCD according the DSM-IV [7].Until the early 1970s, OCD was considered a treatment refractory, chronic situation. Neither psychodynamic therapy nor a variety of pharmacological treatments, available at that time, led to significant improvement. Today, substantial evidence suggests that behavior therapy is effective in treating this chronic disorder [8]. Furthermore, recent advances in pharmacotherapy have led to a significant reduction in suffering and a return to productive living for many patients with OCD [9]. OCD is currently treated with pharmacological and/or psychological approaches. Our patient refused any pharmacological treatment; thus we recommended psychotherapy (20 sessions).Among the best established treatments are behavioral therapy, particularly those involving exposure and response prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) involves the combination of behavior therapy (BT; exposure with response prevention, ERP) and cognitive therapy (CT). After more than a quarter century of research, ERP has become the gold standard to which other psychological treatments for OCD, such as CT, have been compared [10]. For CBT15–20 sessions are proposed for the treatment of an uncomplicated OCD patient. The format is individual weekly therapy sessions. A maintenance schedule is required (monthly booster sessions for 6–12 months).BT for OCD most specifically involves exposure and response or ritual prevention. The effectiveness of BT, in the form of ERP for OCD, has been demonstrated in controlled studies and meta-analyses [11, 12]. To date, the last meta-analysis [12]including 77 studies with 4,651 patients showed that BT was superior to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Exposure capitalizes on the fact that anxiety usually attenuates after a sufficient duration of contact with a feared stimulus. In order to achieve adequate exposure, it is usually necessary to help the patient block the rituals or avoidance behaviors, a process termed response or ritual prevention. In fact, the OCD patient is exposed to stimuli that provoke the obsessive response and helped to desist from avoidance and escape (compulsive) behavior. The rationale for treatment has to be outlined in the detail during the initial session for the patient and significant others, if present. This rationale uses a functional analysis to describe the patient's symptoms and to explain how the reduction of anxiety through compulsions maintains the behavior. It includes the theoretical and practical implications of ERP, focusing on the reduction of anxiety and rituals, and explains imaginary and in vivo exposure. Information gathering includes current OCD symptoms and general functioning, administration of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, course and history of OCD, previous treatment and response, general psychosocial and family history. Information gathering usually requires three sessions. Treatment planning has to be completed in the session preceding the first exposure session, focusing on the construction of a hierarchy (which includes items that the patient either currently avoids or performs only with rituals). The patient is asked to rate each item on a rating scale in which 0 indicates no anxiety and 100 indicates maximum anxiety. After the situations are ranked from lowest to highest anxiety rating, exposure therapy proceeds upward on the hierarchy, beginning with the lower-rated items to maximize compliance of the patient. The techniques which have to be used are therapist-aided ERP in imagination and/or in vivo, exposure in vivo with response prevention through homework and family intervention whenever the family is involved in rituals [13, 14]. The patients have to record homework completion. Behavioral homework is discussed and set with the therapist.To date less attention has been paid to CT, which may be added to ERP, to address such things as faulty estimation of danger or the exaggerated sense of personal responsibility often seen in OCD patients. The first step in CT for OCD consists of informing the patient that his/her intrusive thoughts are an abnormal phenomenon and provides him or her with a list of intrusive thoughts that commonly occur in the general population [15]. The patient learns that the difference between normal and dysfunctional intrusive thoughts lies in the significance attached to these thoughts. The interpretation of these intrusive thoughts made by people with obsession affects the occurrence and/or the content of these thoughts [16]. An important general cognitive technique used by the therapist to challenge the automatic thoughts is Socratic Dialogue [17]. The patient is encouraged to question the catastrophic significance of the intrusive thought and to construct alternative less catastrophic interpretations. Behavioral experiments are also commonly used to test the empirical basis of the patient's new interpretation in order to challenge or evaluate the beliefs. Two controlled trials compared CT based on Beck's model and ERP. Van Oppen et al. [10]demonstrated that CT was better than ERP at the post-test phase, but to date no follow-up of this study has been published. In a randomized controlled trial [18]CT and intensive BT were equally effective on OCD, but at post-test CT had specific effects on depression which were stronger than those of BT. Findings for the 1-year follow-up study are presently in preparation. The principal finding is that benefits are maintained and both treatments produced equivalent results: at week 26 and 52, improvement was retained in both groups without between-group difference. Cognitive measures of obsessions changed equally in the 2 groups.In our case, the first 3 sessions were assigned to the behavioral analysis, the therapeutic goals, and evaluation. We then started the CT from session 3 to 12. We first explained the OCD cognitive model to the patient, and then we taught her to point out and modify her automatic thoughts and cognitive biases. Automatic thoughts dealt with disasters and her responsibility for these ('if I haven't closed the window, someone will enter and take my son away'). During the 13th session, we started the behavioral therapy (ERP) for 8 sessions. After having explained the OCD behavioral model and the habituation principle to the patient, we set up a hierarchy in order to expose the patient (imaginary and in vivo exposure).The predominant hypothesis about OCD pathophysiology implicates abnormal serotonergic function regulation. Research clearly shows that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only effective treatments for OCD. These medications increase the concentration of serotonin. Six SRIs are currently available: clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram are SSRIs because they primarily affect only serotonin. Clomipramine is a nonselective SRI: it affects many other neurotransmitters besides serotonin.In most cases, treatment should be initiated with a SSRI because of the superior safety tolerability, and equivalent efficacy of this class of drug compared with clomipramine [19]. Actually, there have been relatively few comparative studies between the SSRIs in the treatment of OCD [20, 21, 22]. The studies comparing SSRI and clomipramine have shown that they all demonstrated efficacy [23, 24]. However, clomipramine is also associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In a flexible dose trial of paroxetine compared with clomipramine in 406 patients with OCD [26], paroxetine and clomipramine were more effective than placebo. In terms of efficacy, no significant difference between paroxetine and clomipramine were noted beginning at week 6, and the response was nearly equivalent at week 12. However, significantly more patients treated with clomipramine withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. In a review of the efficacy of SRIs in OCD [30], the authors reported that SSRIs possess efficacy similar to that of clomipramine, but have a superior side effect profile. This suggestion may have important implications for patients with OCD who require long-term treatment. In a multicenter meta-analysis [31]placebo-controlled trials found clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline to be superior to placebo. These authors also found that the 3 SSRIs were comparable to each other in efficacy and that clomipramine was more effective than the SSRIs. Stein et al. [32]presented a meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy trials for OCD. In placebo-controlled trials, SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) had a significant effect on medication effect size with clomipramine more effective than fluoxetine. Another meta- analytic review of the efficacy of drug treatments [33]found that SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) are effective in short-term treatments for patients suffering from OCD; although the increase in improvement rate over placebo was greater for clomipramine than for SSRIs, direct comparison between these drugs showed that they had similar therapeutic efficacy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms; concomitant high levels of depression at the outset did not seem necessary for clomipramine and for SSRIs to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In a meta-analysis comparing pharmacological treatments of OCD (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) [34], clomipramine was not significantly better than fluoxetine or fluvoxamine; no significant difference was found between clomipramine and the other SRIs as a group in head to head trials; furthermore, no difference in drop-out rates was found. Clomipramine stands out from the other SRIs. The authors conclude that this difference is probably not clinically significant enough to warrant first choice treatment, given clomipramine's greater lethality in overdose.The backbone of pharmacological treatment for OCD is a 10- to 12- week trial with clomipramine or a SSRI in adequate doses before initiating alternative therapy. Actually, OCD appears to respond in a time interval of approximately 8–12 weeks. Clinical experience suggests the necessity of long-term, and in some case lifelong treatment. As far as pharmacologic treatment is concerned, a drug treatment should last at least 2 years after the remission of symptoms before considering medication withdrawal. This is motivated by the fact that preliminary evidence suggests that relapses after discontinuation of the drug are associated with increased resistance of treatment [35]. If the patient does not respond to an average dose of SSRI, the experts [36]recommend gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 4–8 weeks from the start of the treatment. When a patient is having a partial response to an average dose of SSRI, the experts suggest gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 5–9 weeks from the start of the treatment. They consider 8–13 weeks an adequate medication trial before changing medication or augmenting with another agent.Despite these significant advances in pharmacological treatment with SSRIs and clomipramine, as many as 40–60% of OCD patients are clinically unchanged after an adequate trial with these agents [37].Simos [38]reported that the efficacy of combined BT and pharmacotherapy for OCD is controversial. In a review of relevant studies, Steketee [39]concluded that this combination has shown little advantage over BT alone. Preliminary findings from a trial by Kozak et al. [40]also supported this conclusion. However, some controlled studies combining BT with antidepressants showed a better outcome on rituals and depression in the long term. In particular, Cottraux et al. [41]showed that SSRI + BT compared to placebo + BT gives better results at 3 months on rituals and at 6 months on depression with equivalent results at 12 and 18 months. Moreover, a more recent but small sample study comparing CBT and medication in the treatment of OCD provided evidence in favor of the combination [42]. OCD patients received 1 of 4 treatments: medication and CBT simultaneously; CBT only; medication while on a waiting list for CBT, or no treatment while on a waiting list for CBT. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and clinical ratings significantly improved after treatment in all groups except the non-treatment, waiting list, control group. Subjects in the 2 treatment groups receiving CBT showed reduced strength in their obsessional beliefs. The subsequent administration of CBT to those groups on the waiting list also decreased the strength of their primary obsessional beliefs and beliefs about the consequences of not performing the rituals. Results of this small sample study suggest that either CBT or medication alone is more effective than no treatment. The combination seems to potentiate treatment efficacy, and, according to the authors, it is more clinically beneficial to introduce CBT after a period of medication rather than to start both therapies simultaneously. This study is limited by the small number of subjects per condition (5–9 maximum), the duration of the treatment (5 months), and the absence of follow-up.Initial management of OCD relies on potent SRIs and CBT, used separately, sequentially or concurrently. 90% of patients can be helped with one or combination of these therapies [43].Unfortunately some patients do not respond adequately or at all to the initial treatment plan of CBT or SSRI or a combination of the two. The experts [36]recommend adding an SSRI when patients have not responded well to CBT alone. When patients have not done well with medication management alone, the experts suggest either adding CBT or switching to another SSRI. Thus, combined CBT and medication is the experts' preference for most patients who have not responded to an initial trial of either CBT or medication alone. In patients who have shown no response to combined treatment, the experts recommend switching SSRIs and continuing CBT. In patients with a partial response to combination therapy, they suggest switching SSRIs, providing more CBT, and possibly augmenting with another medication.Some patients are treatment-refractory, defined by the experts [36]as those who fail to respond to 3 sequential well-delivered SRI trials combined with expert CBT. A thorough clinical assessment of patients with treatment-refractory OCD is the first step in planning possible intervention. All DSM-IV axes should be thoroughly evaluated. These aspects include assessment of complications: Axis I (e.g., comorbid disorders); Axis II (e.g., personality disorders); Axis III (e.g., underlying medical disorder), and Axis IV (e.g., psychosocial stressors). In addition, the OCD symptoms themselves should be carefully assessed. Actually, there is some evidence that hoarding is more likely than other OCD symptoms to fail to respond to treatment [44, 45].There are a growing number of management options, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy augmentation, and alternative interventions for treatment-refractory OCD patients. The literature has somewhat less agreement about what to do in managing treatment-refractory patients. First-line recommendations are to add an augmenting medication, especially if the patient exhibits associated features (e.g., tics or a comorbid anxiety disorder) that might predict a positive response to augmentation. For example, it may be helpful to add an anxiety-reducing medication, such as clonazepam or alprazolam, in patients with high levels of anxiety; a high potency neuroleptic, such as haloperidol or risperidone, when tics or comorbid schizotypy are present. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting (e.g., using a partial hospital or inpatient behavioral unit to conduct therapist-assisted ERP), technique, intensity (additional CBT sessions or intensive CBT), or format (family or group therapy), or to switch to another SRI or a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Pharmacotherapy augmentation included augmentation with serotoningeric agents, dopaminergic agents, and various other agents as well as alternative forms (e.g., increased doses) or routes (e.g., intravenous administration) of SRI administration.There are a variety of psychological factors, such as low motivation, negative expectancies for treatment success, procrastination, and noncompliance, that may interfere with response to ERP. In these cases, the cognitive component of OCD should be addressed more directly [46]. Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions were studied as predictors of compliance with and response to BT in a controlled trial [47]. High scores on the hoarding dimension were more likely to dropout prematurely from the study and tend to improve less. BT is specially indicated for OCD patients with aggressive/checking, contamination/cleaning and symmetry/ordering symptoms. OCD patients with comorbid personality disorder should be treated by integrative CT [48].To better understand the causes of obsessions and compulsions, further work needs to be done to identify cognitive domains (beliefs and appraisals) that are specific to OCD. Some of the beliefs and appraisals identified by the Obsessive Compulsive Working Group [49]may be nonspecific, playing a role in obsessions, compulsions, and in many other clinical problems such as depression and generalized anxiety. Further work also needs to be done to identify the causes of important beliefs and appraisals. Advances in understanding OCD are more likely to occur if we can integrate the various methods of assessment [50]. There are also several challenges to be met in the area of OC spectrum disorders. First, the boundaries of the OC spectrum need to be better defined. More systematic research is needed on the relationship between OCD and various spectrum disorders, especially with respect to etiology, treatment response, and other theoretical important features [51]. Notwithstanding the growing evidence for the efficacy of CT or CBT in treating OCD, there is still little evidence that cognitive components of treatment add to the effectiveness of behavioral therapy [18, 52]. Perhaps we do not yet know enough about cognition in OCD, especially how to measure and modify them. A number of researchers have demonstrated that CBT produces a change in measures of beliefs considered relevant and/or specific to OCD. However, these studies are preliminary at this point, but nonetheless promising [53].The development of new models of OCD should help to understand and improve actual treatments, such as the model of perceived impulsivity and compensatory compulsivity [54].The experts [36]usually prefer to begin the treatment of OCD with either CBT alone or with a combination of CBT and medication. The likelihood that medication will be included in the recommendation varies with the severity of the OCD and the age of the patient. In milder OCD, CBT alone is the initial choice. As severity increased, the experts are more likely to add medications to CBT as the initial treatment or to use medication alone. In younger patients, the experts are more likely to use CBT alone. The experts consider the combination of ERP as the optimal behavioral psychotherapy for OCD, while CT may provide additional benefit by directly targeting distorted 'OCD beliefs' and/or by improving compliance with ERP.In managing treatment-refractory patients, the experts suggest a variety of augmentation strategies that can be tried in OCD, including clomipramine, clonazepam, conventional neuroleptics, buspirone, risperidone, and a second SSRI added to the first. The choice of augmentation medications would have to be tailor made for each patient. Clomipramine may be useful in boosting the response of a patient treated with an SSRI who is not having an adequate response. Neuroleptics may be helpful for patients who have not had an adequate response to an SRI and who have a comorbid tic disorder, OCD symptoms such as compulsive touching that resembles tics, or a comorbid schizotypy. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting, technique, or intensity, or to switch to another SRI or an MAOI. Finally, in patients with extremely severe and non-remitting OCD, intravenous clomipramine, neurosurgery, or electro-convulsive therapy (if the patient is also depressed) may sometimes be considered.The case illustrated in here represents a typical obsessive compulsive patient. We offered her a CBT effective in 20 sessions. The Yates-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score dropped from 29 at the beginning of therapy to 13 at the end of the treatment. This decrease represents a 55% efficacy. Results were stable for the 1-year follow-up. The overall strategies for treatment of OCD are presented in figure 1. On the basis of the evidence available, the following approach is outlined.The first step in treating OCD is educating the patient and family about OCD and its treatment as a medical illness. During the last 20 years, two effective treatments have been developed: CBT and medication with a SSRI. Education is crucial in helping the patients and their families learn how to best manage OCD and prevent complications. CBT is the key element of treatment for most patients with OCD. Medication with SSRI is helpful for many patients, especially for patients with depression. The BT (ERP) involved systematic exposure to the obsessions as well as prevention of any compulsive or neutralizing behaviors that might be used to reduce anxiety. ERP did prove to be a very successful form of treatment for OCD, especially for those with washing and, to a lesser extent, checking rituals. Outcome studies of ERP indicate that approximated 70–80% of OCD patients who complete treatment show significant symptom improvement [55]. CT, which may be added to BT, addresses such dysfunctional beliefs as faulty estimation of the importance of thoughts, exaggerated sense of personal responsibility and perfectionism often seen in OCD patients. CT may also provide additional benefits by improving compliance with ERP. CT may also be of value for the substantial number of refusers and potential drop-outs of BT. Because of well-proven efficacy and safety profiles, the SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of patients with OCD. Patients who initially do not respond to SSRI therapy may benefit from switching to another SSRI or combining another medication or CBT with SSRI. There is evidence that addition of a neuroleptic may improve response to SSRI in some patients.Once OCD symptoms are eliminated or much reduced – a goal which is practical for the majority of those with OCD – then maintenance of treatment gains becomes the goal. When patients have completed a successful course of treatment for OCD, most experts recommend monthly follow-up visits for at least 6 months and continued treatment for at least 2 years before trying to stop medication or CBT. Relapse is very common when medication is withdrawn, particularly if the person has not felt the benefit of CBT. Therefore, many experts recommend continuing medication if the patients do not have access to CBT. Individuals with repeated episodes of OCD may need to receive long-term or even life-long prophylactic medication. The experts recommend such long-term treatment after 2–4 severe relapses or 3–4 milder relapses.The efficacy, acceptance and cost-effectiveness of short-term interventions for patients with OCD should certainly be further improved. The identification of factors which predict treatment response is a major goal. To effectively address the needs of individuals with severe and refractory OCD, current treatment strategies may need to be modified and supplemented. A promising area of research is the role of cognitive factors in OCD. Only the reports by Sookman and Pinard [48]have specifically examined the use of cognitive intervention with a difficult-to-treat sample of OCD patients. The apparent success of their cognitive treatment suggests that cognitive mechanisms could be involved in determining the severity or resilience of OCD. However, firm conclusions regarding the specific effects on cognitive intervention on severe or refractory OCD must await controlled studies.The authors wish to thank Emilie Aurouer for the English translation.'Case management' is a section which addresses biopsychosocial management of cases in clinical medicine.

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

      "abstract": "Human development is a process that continues throughout an individuals life. Any change of structure of function, not only of a progressive type, is a developmental change. Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

Robust epidemiological data for chronic mania are lacking with regard to its prevalence and clinical features. The present case report is of a 48-year-old male with a six-year history of mood and psychotic symptoms, based on which differential diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder (manic type), schizophrenia, and mania with psychotic symptoms (with chronic course) were made. The diagnosis of chronic mania was confirmed considering the predominance of fluctuating mood symptoms along with psychotic symptoms, lack of remission, and chronic course of illness. Antipsychotics were initially started for six weeks, to which the patient demonstrated a minimal response. A mood stabilizer was added to the regimen, leading to significant improvement, and the patient was discharged. According to existing literature, patients with chronic mania present with severe illness, the presence of psychotic symptoms, and socio-occupational impairment, which was also noticed in this case. The prevalence of chronic mania among patients with bipolar disorder is approximately 13-15%, which constitutes a significant proportion of known mental illnesses. Therefore, chronic mania should be added as a distinct clinical entity in the existing nosological systems.",

Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining.

No clear diagnostic criterion has been established with validity for behavioral addictions. Sexual addiction, including addiction to pornography is not included as a separate entity because of a lack of strong empirical evidence in this area. Different scales can be used for assessment of sexual addiction. Since there is an absence of established diagnostic criteria, the significance of validity of these scales is doubted. Several of the questions in these scales do not yield information about whether the diagnostic criteria are met or not. Pharmacotherapy, together with psychotherapy proves to have a better outcome in such patients as it helps to synthesize the role of developmental antecedents, reduce current anxiety, depression, guilt and to improve social adjustment.",

      "title": "CLINICAL STUDIES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "The scrutiny of this small group of patients, presenting a serious deterioration of insidious onset, reveals as outstanding factors the constitutional inadequacy of the individual patient and the unfavorable external factors which conditioned and frustrated him. Two of the patients developed pulmonary tuberculosis, but the clinical picture and course in these 2 patients were not markedly different from those of the other 7 patients. One may say that in this group the physical examination revealed no adequate cause for the onset of the deterioration. The clinical picture and course of the mental disorder in this group may be outlined as follows: The patient in adolescence or early adult life, without any adequate explanation in the way of physical illness or drastic change in the environment, begins to show a striking loss of sociability, initiative, interest and personal care. The course is as a rule steadily downwards, ending in a parasitic existence at a very low level. With the abeyance of the superior functions, with the loss of social response, of spontaneity, and of interest, there occur, perhaps as release phenomena, reactions of a lower neurological level—meaningless smiling and laughter, explosive outbursts of anger, occasional autoerotism, mannerisms and grimaces, automatic movements. Memory may be retained to a surprising extent; incoherence is frequently noted but the patient is uncommunicative. There is no special manifestation of basic urges, of underlying preoccupations, of repressed and dissociated factors. There seems to be a lack of vital energy associated with the egoistic as with the more complex social trends. The condition is one of defect rather than of conflict. In the comparative absence of tension, or turmoil, of compensatory strivings or phantasies, the clinical picture makes the impression of self-abandonment, of surrender, of acceptance of life at a lower automatic level. This surrender may be further evidence of the constitutional defect of vitality of the organism already indicated in childhood and made more manifest in face of the demands of the independent, mature, social life. The challenge of life to these underprivileged, poorly conditioned, and frustrated individuals is beyond their capacity. While others with somewhat different endowment react with hysterical or compulsive evasions, with affective slumps or sprees, with imaginative phantasies or regressive dramatisations, this group differently endowed reacts to the challenge with a simple surrender. If we continue to retain these patients within the hospitable group of schizophrenia, it may be legitimate to characterize their special type of reaction as schizophrenic \"surrender.\" In the further analysis of the conditions of this \"surrender\" the inadequacy or abiotrophy of component systems of the organism requires to be investigated and evaluated.",

Unemployment can evoke apathy, fear or frustration and then it leads to more serious disorders such as neuroses, depression and so forth. It can be also responsible for suicidal attempts. These disorders are usually associated with somatic complaints. Stress evoked by the loss of the job is the major factor affecting the health state of an unemployed person. The loss of income and social status is another important factor.

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among American adults, with lifetime prevalence rates of up to 25% in women and 12% in men, and point prevalence rates of 6% in women and 3% in men.1 These gender differences are relatively constant over adulthood, although there is evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing and the age of first onset is decreasing. Major depressive disorder is even more common among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with estimates ranging from 16% to 27%, and an additional 20% to 30% of cardiac patients with minor depression (mDD) or elevated depressive symptoms.2 Major depressive disorder is best diagnosed by a psychiatric interview. To meet criteria for MDD, a patient must report sad or “depressed” mood or a significant loss of interest in all or most things that were previously considered enjoyable for a minimum of 2 weeks, and at least an additional 4 (or 3, if both dysphoric mood and loss of pleasure are present) of the following symptoms: significant weight loss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Minor depression (mDD) is not yet an official psychiatric diagnosis, but rather is a clinical syndrome often used for research purposes. Its features are similar to MDD, but with fewer depressive symptoms and less impairment. An episode of mDD involves either a sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and a total of at least 2 but less than 5 additional depressive symptoms. Dysthymia is marked by a chronically depressed mood state for at least 2 years. At least 2 additional depressive symptoms are present without meeting criteria for MDD. Self-report instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zung Depression Scale, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) can also reliably assess depressive symptoms, although questionnaires cannot diagnose MDD and should not be considered a substitute for clinical interviews for diagnostic purposes. In this issue of the journal, Todaro and colleagues report that more than 20% of patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) met criteria for a current depressive disorder, including 9.1% for MDD, 6.4% for mDD, and 5.5% for dysthmia. These figures may be somewhat lower than expected, based on previous reports.2 However, the lower estimates may be attributable to the relatively small sample size, selective enrollment (only 82% of eligible CR participants agreed to undergo the psychiatric assessment), and use of an unfamiliar instrument, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, for the diagnosis and severity rating of depression. In addition, it is possible that patients who are referred for CR—and more importantly, follow through with the referral—may not be representative of the general cardiac population. Indeed it has been shown that patients with depression are less likely to adhere to prescribed medical therapies, including participation in CR services.3 More striking, however, was the prevalence of depression among female patients, with 43% of female CR participants meeting criteria for depressive disorder during their lifetimes compared with only 19% among males. Furthermore, almost 29% of women in the study met criteria for a current depressive disorder compared with only 9% of men. These are sobering figures and are significant for a number of important reasons: depression takes a devastating toll on patients' quality of life; adversely affects marital and social relations; results in increased use of social and medical services; is associated with more days in bed or days away from normal activities; and is responsible for enormous financial costs for treatment, lost productivity, and absenteeism from work. In addition, there is mounting evidence that depression is associated with worse prognosis, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in relative risk in patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction (MI),4 congestive heart failure,5 and post—coronary artery bypass surgery.6 Moreover, mDD, dysthymia, and even subclinical depression as measured by elevated scores on self-report instruments such as BDI and CES-D scales are associated with increased risk.2 Thus, not only recognizing depression but also successfully treating it has become a priority. Several recent studies have assessed the extent to which depression can be successfully treated in cardiac populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely considered to be safe for patients with CHD. For example, the SADHART study showed that sertraline did not adversely affect cardiac function and was safe for most patients.7 While non-significant or modest reductions in depressive symptoms were noted in the sample as a whole, evidence suggested that treatment was effective for patients with recurrent or more severe depression. There is also great interest in nonpharmacological approaches to treatment. Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy all have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression in healthy, depressed populations without CHD. In addition, the ENRICHD trial recently showed that similar to antidepressant medication, CBT is modestly effective in reducing depression in acute post-MI patients.8 Evidence suggests that exercise therapy also may be an effective treatment for depression,9 and exercise after an acute MI has recently been reported to be associated with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with MDD,10 suggesting that exercise is a promising intervention for patients with CHD and depression. It remains to be seen whether treating depression may reduce risk of adverse events in depressed CHD patients. Although the ENRICHD trial failed to demonstrate that reducing depression improved survival, antidepressant use was actually associated with better clinical outcomes, independent of the effects on depression. Additional randomized controlled trials need to be undertaken with cardiac patients who are depressed to examine efficacy for psychosocial and “hard” clinical endpoints. It should be noted that because of improvements in the surgical and medical management of patients, it is possible that treating depression may not reduce significantly the risk of death or reinfarction over and above standard risk factors such as CHD severity and the presence of medical cormorbidities. Nevertheless, depression remains a highly prevalent and insidious comorbid condition in cardiac patients and needs to be recognized and treated, if not to prolong life then certainly to enhance patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "abstract": "Diagnosis and therapy of male hypogonadism is still a challenge because of the unspecific clinical signs and symptoms. The clinical presentation of a androgen deficiency is age-related. In the adult men, one can often observe fatigue, decrease in physical capacity, loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. At the physical examination, genitalia have always to be assessed in search of a testes/penis atrophy. Two fasting measurements of total testosterone concentrations by a reliable assay are needed to confirm the diagnosis. By assessing gonadotropines the origin of hypogonadism can be determined (central/secondary or peripheral/primary). Exogenous administration of androgens should be considered in young, sportive, healthy and muscular males. Patients with metabolic syndrome should only be screened for hypogonadism in the presence of suggestive symptoms. Prostate disease, hematocrit higher than 50 %, uncontrolled heart failure and severe obstructive sleep apnea are contraindications of a testosterone replacement therapy. Patients with metabolic-syndrome-associated low testosterone levels should firstly benefit from a lifestyle intervention that can normalize clinical and biochemical hypogonadism. So far, there is no clear evidence for a possible benefit of testosterone therapy in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Similarly, in patients with PADAM (partial androgen deficiency of the aging male) testosterone therapy is not established or recommended. Die Klinik einer Hypoandrogenämie ist altersabhängig. Bei dem erwachsenen Mann sind die häufigsten Symptome Verminderung der Leistungsfähigkeit und Verlust der Libido. Die erektile Dysfunktion ist selten nur durch einen Hypogonadismus verursacht. Obligat gehört zur klinischen Untersuchung der Status der Genitalien (Penis/Hoden Hypo-/Atrophie). Die exokrine Insuffizienz (Infertilität) muss mit dem Spermiogramm objektiviert werden (häufig mehrere Spermiogramme nötig). Die Diagnose der endokrinen Insuffizienz basiert auf mindestens zwei Nüchtern-Gesamttestosteronwerte unter dem Normbereich. Dann sollen die Gonadotropine (FSH/LH) bestimmt werden um einen primären (Hodenproblematik) von einem sekundären Hypogonadismus (zentral) zu unterscheiden. Ein iatrogener Hypogonadismus soll bei jüngeren Männern, die intensiven Kraftsport treiben, immer zuerst ausgeschlossen werden. Bei Patienten mit metabolischem Syndrom können erniedrigte Testosteronwerte gemessen werden. Das Gesamttestosteron sollte aber nur bei Symptomen bestimmt werden. Bevor eine Testosteron Substitution begonnen wird, muss eine Prostata-Erkrankung, eine Polyglobulie, eine Herzinsuffisienz und ein Schlafapnoe Syndrom klinisch und gegebenenfalls labormässig ausgeschlossen werden. Die Indikation, ein Testosteronmangel im Rahmen eines metabolischen Syndroms sowie bei PADAM (oder Andropause) zu substituieren, ist umstritten.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Illness behavior refers to the ways in which symptoms are perceived, understood, acted upon, and communicated and include facial grimacing, holding or supporting the affected body part, limping, using a cane, and stooping while walking. Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

      "title": "Apathy in schizophrenia: assessment in clinical settings and overlap with other dimensions of impairment",
      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

The etiology of PMS remains unclear and concise, universal diagnostic criteria are missing, which leads to the lack of effective diagnosis and therapy. Hormone therapy of the PMS is one of the leading methods to eliminate the symptoms that occur in the luteal phase, but it has some limitations, and sometimes causes side effects that negate the benefits of its application. Psychotropic drugs are the drugs of choice for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, but their long-term use is generally not recommended because of the possibility of addiction and the occurrence of adverse reactions. The research for relevant means of reducing the severity or eliminating the symptoms of PMS, not only among drugs, but also among the means of herbal medicine and non-drug methods of exposure remains important.",

Hinsichtlich hormoneller Regelkreise gibt es bei diesen Gruppen Hinweise auf eine Dysregulation in der Hypothalamus-Hypophysen-Gonaden-Achse. Erhöhte Testosteronwerte sind möglicherweise im Hinblick auf eine gesteigerte allgemeine Aggressionsneigung und eine erhöhte Tendenz zu dominanten sozialen Verhaltensstilen bedeutsam. Trotz vieler hypothetischer Annahmen gibt es kaum spezifische Untersuchungen zu Auffälligkeiten im Serotonin-Stoffwechsel bei Paraphilen bzw. Sexualstraftätern. Andere Studien ergeben Hinweise auf frontale und temporale zerebrale Dysfunktionen. Sexuelle Auffälligkeiten im Rahmen neurologischer Erkrankungen können als Folge von (unspezifischer) Enthemmung gewertet werden. Ein Problem vieler Studien sind kleine Fallzahlen und ungenaue diagnostische Beschreibungen der Stichproben. Faktoren wie Händigkeit, Intelligenz und sexuelle Orientierung bleiben oft unberücksichtigt. Die Einordnung bisheriger Ergebnisse in theoretische Modelle zur Ätiologie von Paraphilien/sexueller Delinquenz sollte daher kritisch und nur mit Vorsicht geschehen.",

For each of the three areas, this chapter presents the classifications and epidemiology of the disorders or difficulties, followed by a description of problems experienced by older adults, theories that explain the disorders or problems, and approaches to assessment and treatment in older adults. Cognitive behavior therapy offers an organized basis for treatment of sexual disorders in older adults. Sleep disorders are common in older adults and produce a wide range of deleterious effects. With the etiological complexity of sleep disorders, assessment of sleep problems requires a multidisciplinary approach to evaluation. Pharmacological interventions are commonly prescribed when sleep problems are reported in primary care settings. An effective intervention plan for an older adult coping with chronic pain understands one's own assumptions and expectations about pain and about the clinician's ability to intervene.",

      "abstract": "The process of aging in man involves a lot of functional and structural changes in the body organs and systems. In this review we shall characterize the physiological and clinical manifestations of andropause. We'll review the physiological basis of the ageing process, the age-related changes in the testosterone secretion regulation, and the dynamics of androgen action and active testosterone metabolism. We also investigate the multifactorial etiology of age-related physiological changes--the body undergoes changes in its structure, there is a loss of muscle strength and decline in physical functions. Sexual dysfunction, hypogonadism and psychological changes are also commonly observed symptoms in this condition. Changes of similar kind can also be seen in young males with androgen deficiency. The age-related changes in physiological functions can potentially lead to some important consequences such as reduced physical activity, higher risk of developing specific diseases (ischemic heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis), diminished capacity to recover after acute diseases, but most often it leads to increased fracture predisposition. All these may eventually affect negatively the self-care capacity of patients making them require a long-term professional care, and lead to severe psychological and social isolation and increased mortality and change in quality of life. To limit the age-related physiological decline in serum testosterone levels, we should be able to tackle the still unresolved important clinical issue--can hormone replacement therapy administered to elderly men improve their functional status, prevent diseases from developing, improve quality of life and reduce fracture risk. The data included in the present review will contribute to determining the potential benefits and risks of testosterone replacement therapy.",

Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Individual anxiety disorders have considerable symptomatic overlap in their expression. The life-time prevalence of all anxiety disorders in the general population is about 25%. There is familial aggregation of anxiety and mood disorders such as major depression. Genetic factors and life experiences both contribute to the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders. GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and uncontrollable worry, is present for longer than 6 months, and tends to occur comorbidly with other conditions, including other anxiety disorders and major depression as well as general medical conditions. GAD, given its chronic nature, is associated with significant impairment. GAD is responsive to pharmacological treatments, such as anxiolytics and antidepressants, as well as psychotherapies such as cognitive therapy.",

Seiring dengan peningkatan usia lanjut dan tingginya harapan hidup, masalah kesehatan pada lansia juga menonjol, baik fisik maupun psikologis. Salah satunya masalah psikis yang sering dihadapi oleh lansia yaitu depresi. Depresi adalah gangguan alam perasaan ( mood ) yang ditandai dengan kemurungan dan kesedihan yang mendalam dan berkenjutan sehingga hilangnya kegairahan hidup. Usia harapan hidup semakin bertambah, stressor psikososial semakin berat, berbagai penyakit kronik dan kehidupan beragama semakin ditinggalkan serta mengakibatkan ketergantungan kepada orang lain. Apabila ketergantungan pada lansia tidak segera diatasi, maka akan menimbulkan beberapa akibat seperti gangguan sistem tubuh, timbulnya penyakit, menurunnya Activity of Daily Living (ADL). Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk melihat  hubungan kejadian depresi dengan kemampuan melakukan aktifitas dasar sehari-hari.  Penelitian ini dengan jenis analitik dengan desain penelitian yang digunakan adalah cross sectional . Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa Depresi merupakan gangguan efek yang sering terjadi pada lanjut usia dan merupakan salah satu gangguan emosi.

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

It was established that taking into account special working conditions, the personnel of the State Criminal-Executive Service of Ukraine&nbsp;&nbsp;is under the permanent influence of various stress factors, experiences negative emotions and is often in destructive psychological states, which can lead to the development of manifestations of addictive behavior. It was determined that the formation of the addictive behavior covers two stages – experiencing of an acute change in the mental state at the emotional level and the formation of a certain sequence of appeals to the means of addiction, which is common for different forms of such behavior. It has been found that among the representatives of bodies and institutions of execution of punishments the most common are socially acceptable or neutral or comparatively dangerous types of addictive behavior, in particular computer or Internet addiction, workaholism, etc. Among the more socially dangerous forms of addictive behavior, chemical addictions (the use of alcohol and other psychoactive substances – cannabinoids, opiates, psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, etc.), hallucinogens of natural and synthetic origin, as well as the abuse of hypnotic-sedative drugs) and non-chemical addictions (addictions), which at this time, according to researchers, there are currently more than two hundred forms (pathological tendency to gambling; ludomania – sweepstakes, lotteries, slot machines, casinos, less often – card games) are common. On the basis of the conducted research, the need to develop a set of organizational measures in order to prevent the manifestations of addictive behavior of the personnel of the State Criminal-Executive Service of Ukraine, their timely detection and correct diagnosis, as well as instruments of influence for the purpose of correction is emphasized.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan).

      "title": "Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is often consulted in the general hospital to assess for underlying psychiatric contributions to a patient's physical symptoms. Such questions are typically prompted after a medical or neurological evaluation has not identified the etiology of the physical symptoms, if the symptoms are incompatible with or disproportionate to existing medical or neurological pathology, or if the patient is engaging in maladaptive health-related or interpersonal behaviors in the hospital. Provider countertransference in response to patients presenting with psychiatric disorders that feature somatic symptoms—as well as the maladaptive behaviors that may accompany these symptoms—can lead to provider distress or impact patient care and is a critical area for liaison interventions from the consulting psychiatrist. This chapter demonstrates the approach to the hospitalized patient whose physical symptoms may arise secondary to psychological processes or whose psychological response to medical symptoms gives rise to pathological distress, behaviors, and impairment. It highlights some of the psychological factors that may contribute to the experience of and response to somatic symptoms, as well as some of the challenging interpersonal dynamics that occur in the hospital setting. Clinical cases involving somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder present strategies for making complex diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and effectively engaging these patients in psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",

Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail, they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its constraints. However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems, leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in psychological dependency, which itself adversely affects the quality of life. These mechanisms of psychopathology may not hide the possibility of an underlying dementia.",

      "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric and/or psychological factors could be independent risk factors for stroke. Some of these factors may act as stroke triggers producing short-term physiological changes that may directly lead to stroke onset. Most data is related to four distinct domains: (1) depression and/or anxiety and related syndromes, (2) personality and character traits, (3) psychological stress, and (4) psychotropic medication. Some factors (e.g., depression) are closely related to stroke risk, and there is some evidence that psychological stress could be an important risk factor. However, many studies have methodological limitations (small sample size, lack of adjustment for stroke risk factors, or residual confounding) and lack of standardized definition and/or measurement. Data about stroke triggers is scarce but epidemiological studies suggest a triggering effect of acute or subacute life stress exposure. The potential pathophysiological ways by which psychiatric and/or psychological factors may promote stroke include a higher frequency of unhealthy behaviors and direct biological effects on the cardiovascular system, notably through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. More research is still needed to improve measurement and to better investigate the impact of psychiatric and/or psychological factors. The clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms could help to consider preventive strategies.",

      "title": "[Medically unexplained symptoms].",
      "abstract": "Patients with physical symptoms for which no medical explanation can be found are relatively common in general practice. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms are frequently frustrating to physicians both in primary and secondary care and utilize health sources disproportionately. They frequently attend both primary care units and hospitals and are usually not satisfied with the care they receive. Medically unexplained symptoms in patient populations are strongly associated with psychiatric pathology and with anxiety and depression in particular. They are also linked to personality pathology, childhood adversity, adult trauma or medically unexplained symptoms in childhood. The predictive value of alexithymia in determining these symptoms is controversial. Patients who have high negative affectivity or neuroticism tend to score high on measures of physical symptoms. These symptoms have a high degree of co-occurrence. The same person may meet the diagnostic criteria for several functional somatic syndromes simultaneously. The clinician should be aware of the cultural and social shaping of the bodily experience of these patients and hence acknowledge the somatic nature and reality of the symptoms. The clinician should make the person feel understood and establish a positive collaborative relationship. This would enable him/her to correct misconceptions about the disease and give a positive explanation of symptoms. Antidepressant therapy and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy have been proved to be moderately effective in this group of patients. Because of the high disability that might be caused by these symptoms, psychiatrists and primary and secondary care physicians should pay careful attention to this clinical condition. These symptoms may also aid us in challenging the long-held idea of mind-body dualism which is inherent in Western biomedicine.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "abstract": "Introduction ADHD is a diagnosis almost always made in childhood or adolescence and oftent difficult to make it new in adults because it is not thought of in the differential diagnosis process and for the lack of experience from adult devices. - ADHD in adults is characterized by symptoms of executive dysfunction, inattention, emotional dysregulation. The symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity tend to be less evident. Objectives - Frequently, the adult patient with ADHD comes to the consultation with a secondary symptom and the primary pathology is hidden and often not evident at first glance. Methods - A 20-year-old woman, university student, with no relevant medical or psychiatric history, without toxic habits, who attended her first consultation referred by her primary care physician for long-standing insomnia, restless legs and anxiety. - The patient’s underlying complaint and her bigger concern is her poor academic performance. It is striking that she has just started her third year at the university, the first year she did not pass any subjects, the second year she changed majors and only passed two, now she is repeating the course. - The examination did not reveal overt affective symptoms, nor psychotic symptoms or other notable psychopathology. The patient’s speech tended towards superficiality, inconcretion, it was salty, it was difficult for her to express herself, even suggesting a certain intellectual disability. - In the first consultation sleep study is requested. And referral to clinical psychology consultation for psychometric study. Results - She is administered Clinical interview and WAIS IV (Adult Intelligence Scale), Trail Making Test, d2 and Stroop, Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (inattention items). - The WAIS-IV demonstrated global cognitive abilities within normality, although with significantly lower scores in the IMT and IVP indices which involve the functions of attention, concentration, mental control and short-term visual memory). Trail Making Test, d2, Stroop and Diagnostic Interview of ADHD in adults (inattention items) yielded profile results highly suggestive of Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity. - The insomnia subsided with a regimen of 7.5 mg of mirtazapine per day. Subsequently, after starting treatment with low-dose methylphenidate (20 mg/day), the patient improved very significantly, both academic performance and social functioning and mood, self-esteem and subjective well-being. Conclusions - We must always include ADHD in the differential diagnosis of a young adult patient when faced with a wide variety of consultation symptoms, especially if they report some type of deterioration or dysfunction in their social, family or academic life. - An adequate clinical evaluation supported, if possible, by psychometric tests is essential to reach the diagnosis, which allows establishing an effective treatment that modifies the patient’s overall prognosis.

      "title": "A view of the helplessness and violence contained in chronic fatigue syndrome",
      "abstract": "In this work, originally undertaken 10 years ago, the author asks whether there might be any one particular psychopathology likely to be linked specifically with the physical illness known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalitis (ME), and whether CFS/ME aids and abets, and ‘fits’, an original mental state. She thinks the question cannot yet be answered, but hypothesizes that in some personality structures the onset of CFS/ME following a physical illness exacerbates negativity, and is an aspect of ordinary depression where there is a lowering of energy levels and a loss of zest for life, or it may reveal the pathological aspect of unresolved rage. Depending on the degree of pathological disturbance, working with and through the rage may or may not result in a resolution of the symptoms of ME. Some of the problems in the transference and countertransference relationship are considered, which make it extremely difficult to separate out reality from fantasy. There is then the further problem of the denial of the psyche by the patient as part of the violence inherent in the illness. The findings in this paper are corroborated by research undertaken over the last four years and these are incorporated into the paper. One case is presented, an example of ME in a borderline male patient in whom resolution could not be achieved. Copyright © 2005 The British Association of Psychotherapists",

      "title": "Burnout and its impact on Nurses and Doctors",
      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "abstract": "Motor delay is a condition that effects body functions or structure, and make limitation physical activities such as crawling, walking, grabbing or daily activities and may limit the participation and physical activites in children. One of the factors causing motor delayed is the hypothyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone has a vital role in the growth, metabolism, and regulation of body fluids. Thyroid hormone deficiency cause growth failure, and mental retardation. Early detection of motor delay can be done by using Denver Development Screening Test (DDST). This test is done with the purpose to follow the process of child development, to overcome early if found development delay. Physiotherapy is needed to deal with delays in motor development. Therapeutic exercise is one of the modalities of physiotherapy in motor improvement using body movement exercises either actively or passively.\r\nKeywords: motor delay; hypothyroid; therapeutic exercise\r\n\r\nABSTRAK\r\n\r\nMotor delay adalah kondisi yang mempengaruhi fungsi tubuh atau stuktur, dapat membatasi aktivitas fisik seperti merangkak, berjalan, meraih atau aktivitas sehari-hari dan dapat membatasi partisipasi dan aktivitas fisik pada anak. Salah satu faktor yang menyebabkan motor delayed adalah hormon hipotiroid. Hormon tiroid memiliki peran vital dalam pertumbuhan, metabolisme, dan pengaturan cairan tubuh. Kekurangan hormon tiroid dapat menyebabkan kegagalan pertumbuhan, juga dapat mengakibatkan keterbelakangan mental pada penderitanya. Deteksi dini keterlambatan motorik dapat dilakukan dengan menggunakan DDST II (Denver Development Screening Test). Tes ini dilakukan dengan tujuan untuk mengikuti proses perkembangan anak, dan mengatasi secara dini bila ditemukan keterlambatan perkembangan. Fisioterapi diperlukan untuk menangani keterlambatan perkembangan motorik. Terapi latihan adalah salah satu modalitas fisioterapi dalam proses perbaikan motorik dengan menggunakan latihan- latihan gerakan tubuh baik secara aktif maupun pasif. Terapi latihan yang diberikan oleh fisioterapi pada anak dengan hormon hipotiroid, diharapkan dapat memberikan kemajuan perkembangan pada anak tersebut sehingga dapat mencapai tingkat perkembangan yang seoptimal mungkin sesuai dengan usia anak.\r\nKata kunci: motor delay; hormon hipotiroid; terapi latihan",

      "abstract": "Abstract The first part of this two-part series discusses psychological influences in delayed and failed recovery and resulting unnecessary work disability; the second part discusses theoretical and practical aspects of the issue, including evaluation and treatment. Delayed and failed recovery and unnecessary disability (DFRUD) refers to a lag in, or lack of, expected recovery from a medical condition and/or unnecessary resultant disability. Causation is complex, and we are not doing well at managing this group of workers using a biomedical model. The traditional biomedical model posits that disease or injury produces symptoms and signs that cause impairment and result in disability. This approach too strictly separates mental phenomena and bodily function (Cartesian dualism) and leads to scientific reductionism when actually six domains are active in worker disability: medical, personal, psychological, sociocultural, systematic (including compensation and insurance), and workplace elements. Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) should be understood as a disturbance of normal neurological and/or psychological processes underlying symptom production, perception, and experience and cannot be better explained by another physical or psychiatric illness. Within this system of evaluation, administrative and medical iatrogenicity are associated with unnecessary medical care and poor outcomes for individuals. In addition to determining industrial causality and apportionment, if evaluators accept some psychological factors, MUPS, and central sensitization, they must explain to what extent these are compensable. Part two of this article will discuss theoretical and practical approaches, including specific evaluation and treatment methods.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability throughout the world. Although physical and cognitive impairments after stroke have been well studied, little information is known about one of the crucial aspect of the quality of life of stroke patients, namely, sexual functioning and satisfaction. Poststroke sexual dysfunctions seem to be very common since in men affected by stroke, a decline in libido and poor or tailed erection and ejaculation are frequently observed. Sexual disorders after stroke are thought to be due to multiple etiologies, including both organic (i.e., lesion localization, premorbid medical conditions, and medications) and psychosocial (i.e., fear of recurrences, loss of self-esteem, role changes, anxiety, and depression). Thus, exploration in sexual dysfunctions and sexual counseling by trained professionals should be a part of stroke rehabilitation. The aim of this review is to evaluate the burden of stroke on sexual function taking into account the complex interaction between neurological, psychological, and relational factors.",

When there is no secondary cause, constipation is diagnosed as functional constipation. The first steps that should be taken to relieve symptoms are diet and lifestyle modifications, and if unsuccessful, laxative therapy should be initiated. If a patient does not respond to laxative therapy, diagnostic anorectal physiological tests are performed, though they are not routinely recommended. However, these tests may be considered earlier in patients strongly suspected to have a defecatory disorder.

Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence.

After a long time it was unsecessful heal and already spend a lot of\r\ncost, then the family’s mental disorders come to the health center so often it was late and diagnosed in a\r\nstate of severe mental disorders. Many factors were influence a person in choosing health care facilities,\r\nboth conventional health services and traditional health services. The objective: The purpose of this study\r\nto analyzed the factors that influenced the families who live with severe mental disorders patient to take\r\ntraditional treatment. Methods: The design of this study was observational analytic using cross sectional\r\napproach. 100 samples in this study were collected by proportional cluster random sampling technique.\r\nThe data were collected by using questionnaires. Results: Chi square test results showed that there was an\r\ninfluence of health beliefs (p value 0.005), family resources (p value 0.022), social resources (p value\r\n0.025), family needs (p value 0.013), and evaluation of achievement needs (p-value 0.013) to the selection\r\nof traditional treatment among families who living with severe mental disorders. Multiple logistic\r\nregression test showed that the most dominant variable was health beliefs with p value 0.007 with OR\r\n0.258. Conclusion: Based on the result of this research, it can be concluded that there are influence of\r\nhealth beliefs, family resources, social / community resources, family needs, and evaluation of the\r\nachievement of family needs on the selection of traditional treatment among family who living with\r\nserious mental disorder and the most dominant factor is health beliefs. The implication of this study is the\r\nimproving of health beliefs especially among family who living with severe mental disorders will be more\r\npositive so they can select the right treatment for their family members who have severe mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a rare condition, however its consequences might be devastating, since it affects patients’ physical function as well as psychological well-being. Therefore, it is not surprising for patients with SCI to develop mental health problems, such as depression and/or anxiety. Depressive symptoms include agitation, restlessness, fatigue, changes in appetite, helplessness, loss of interest as well as problems in sleeping. The presence of depression has been connected with extended length of hospitalization and development of secondary medical complications, as well as reduced quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy. The purpose of this review is to investigate the existing literature to identify the effect of depression on hospitalization and rehabilitation in patients with SCI. From the 31 studies included in this paper, it is obvious that SCI patients with depression have longer periods of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation as well as worse functional outcomes. Moreover, it was shown that SCI individuals with depressive symptoms frequently develop other secondary medical complications which subsequently affect the length of stay and the rehabilitation outcomes. Acknowledging these facts can improve diagnosis and intervention, which may also improve the patient’s recovery outcome.",

The worsening of psychic state and full development of anorexia nervosa symptoms occurred during stressful life event (e.g. avoidance by sexual partner). The majority of those patients had present and past (from adolescence) various anxiety and depressive disorders and personality disorders (obsessive--compulsive, borderline). In most of the women older than 40 years, anorexia nervosa comorbid with depressive disorders, less often with mixed, anxiety--depressive, disorders. The symptoms occurred during menopause, after loss of life-partner (separation or death). It was not established, which of these disorders appeared as the first one.

Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11.

Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12. Psychosocial intervention strategies a. Emphasis on outpatient treatment b. Partial hospitalization, day treatments, outpatient care c. Family therapy reduces relapse rate d.

Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use. Nevertheless, these methods do not work equally well for all types of addicts.",

Special features of childhood interpersonal trauma leading to the development of borderline personality disorder are the seriousness of the trauma and the fact that it is sexual in nature. Serious intrafamilial childhood abuse can lead not only to the classic post-traumatic stress syndrome, but can influence all aspects of personality development, including the distortion of the sense of identity, self-regulation, and the patterns of interpersonal relations. Viewed from the perspective of the trauma concept, the entire range of adult borderline symptoms are considered as being the consequences of severe complex traumatic experiences. Other clinicians regard such an abuse as a marker of the severity of familial dysfunction and emphasize the role of other pathogenic factors, such as biparental neglect and biological vulnerability of the pre-borderline child.",

However, the future paradigm of medicine should use the concepts of rule in and disease prevention. The adrenal glands produce many hormones including cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) which is play an important role in energy and immune modulation, ultimately stress adaptation. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, an important component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, is the last hormone to stop working in pituitary gland. The biological reserve for adrenal glands needs minimum 10 percent to rule out histopathological diseases. Therefore, the disease category in adrenal glands is limited, albeit their crucial role for daily life, such as Addison’s disease and secondary adrenal insufficiency, especially in perspective of stress adaptation. After exclusion of adrenal diseases, we can perform some laboratory tests to evaluate functional and dynamic status for adrenal hormones, and do a three-dimensional examination: 1) One day evaluation for diurnal variation of cortisol in context of individual lifestyle, 2) Serial evaluation for cortisol, pregnenolone, DHEA and adrenal status, 3) Cross-sectional staging for adrenal status according to cortisol and DHEA levels. Based on the functional estimations for adrenal status, individualized management should be done: Lifestyle modification, therapeutic diet education, supplementation, and medication if necessary. Bridging the gap between conventional approach and functional approach for chronic fatigue may be helpful for enhancing health and quality of life. In upcoming super-aging society, the importance of functional fatigue status would be more noticed and multidisplinary approach should be actively performed.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disease with unknown etiology, a scientific challenge for researchers and is often a complex condition to manage for clinicians. Life exists by maintaining a complex dynamic equilibrium or homeostasis that is constantly challenged by intrinsic or extrinsic adverse forces, the stressors. Stress reactivity is markedly influenced by both pubertal maturation and the experience in the individual. For example, chronic stress destroys bodies, minds and lives. Chronic stress kills through suicide, violence, heart attack, stroke, and cancer. Much evidence suggests that women with PCO often at risk for secondary complications of this syndrome including reproductive (infertility, hyperandrogenism, hirsutism), metabolic (insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, adverse cardiovascular risk profiles) and psychological features (increased anxiety, depression and worsened quality of life). The relation-ships between the psychological health aspects and the clinical characteristics of PCOS are not yet clear. In this review, we investigate the key roles of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and norepinephrine (NE) in orchestrating the response to stress in women with PCOS.",

Etiological theories can be divided into psycho-sexual (anxiety-related, behavioral) and biological (pelvic floor alteration, hypersensitivity of the glans penis, accelerated conduction and cortical amplification of the genital stimuli), both sharing the neurobiological assumption of serotonergic mediation. Premature ejaculation can be iatrogenic (amphetamine, cocaine, dopaminergic drugs) or secondary to urological diseases (prostatovesiculitis, frenulum breve) or to neurological diseases (multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathies, medullary expansion processes).",

      "abstract": "Nervousness, sleep disorders, mood instability and sexual dysfunction are frequent symptoms during menopause. It is commonly believed that they are due to the characteristic menopausal hormonal changes. However, they also commonly occur in psychiatric disorders unrelated to the menopause. The literature deals with the characteristic psychological aspects and studies have examined the ways in which menopausal phenomena are related to the hormonal background and its effect on the brain. The clinical menopausal picture may be complicated by secondary psychiatric disease. Also, menopausal symptoms and symptoms of previous psychiatric disease may coexist. In addition, menopause may precipitate psychiatric disorders in women predisposed to them. Accumulated personal myths and expectations related to the menopause are likely to affect the way in which a woman copes with it. Important factors in this connection include education, culture and certain life events. In all such cases precise evaluation of the etiology, with its intermingled gynecological and psychiatric factors is required. Such women should be treated by both a gynecologist and a psychiatrist. We present 5 cases, 4 of which were sent to the menopause clinic and were then referred for psychiatric evaluation and treatment. The other case presented at a psychiatric clinic due to a first acute psychotic state. Laboratory tests showed typical changes of menopause.",

The aim is to refute the hypothesis of the need to identify this clinical condition in a new descriptive framework. Materials and methods: Pubmed checklist, clinical interview, and psychometric tests. Results: In the entirety of the selected population, it emerges that the primary disorder is schizoid personality disorder; this is followed by depressive disorder, narcissistic covert disorder, bipolar disorder with depressive prevalence, obsessive disorder, avoidant disorder, and somatic disorder as secondary dysfunctional personality traits. Childhood and/or family trauma, capable of impacting the sexual and affective sphere, is present in almost the entire population. Conclusion: The syndrome should be framed as a specific phenomenon and not as a new psychopathological disorder, as the symptomatological descriptions are similar to the already known schizoid personality disorder; the symptomatological differences among patients should be framed according to a logic of correctives determined by the presence of one or more secondary psychopathological traits that draw a more complex personality picture than the simple nosographic diagnosis of the DSM-V.",

      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

Por consiguiente, su sospecha clínica en este género es muy baja. Este síndrome con frecuencia se encuentra asociado a fatiga, síntomas depresivos y disfunción sexual, aunque no se cuenta con evidencia suficiente que correlacione esta entidad con antecedentes de trauma testicular y alteración de la relación testosterona libre - globulina transportadora de hormona sexual masculina (SHBG).Presentamos el caso de un paciente masculino de 40 años con cuadro clínico de 6 meses de evolución de astenia, adinamia, dolor generalizado, pérdida progresiva de peso, síntomas depresivos y disfunción sexual con antecedente de vasectomía, quien fue valorado por múltiples especialidades, recibió tratamiento con antidepresivos y benzodiacepinas que produjeron mejoría parcial de la sintomatología.

      "title": "Enfermedad, deseo de muerte y depresión: La necesidad de valoración clínica y de reflexión ética sobre el límite entre derecho de elegir y derecho al tratamiento",
      "abstract": "espanolEste trabajo parte de la reflexion sobre los comentarios que en los medios han acompanado hace aproximadamente un ano al suicidio de un conocido director italiano, muy anciano, hospitalizado por una patologia neoplastica. Una actitud comun, juzgada en este articulo como conformista y superficial, ha propuesto una valoracion altamente positiva del gesto, presentado esencialmente como un acto de valor consecuente con una reflexion lucida y coherente de su propia condicion existencial. Pero en realidad es una consideracion muy simple, la de la hipotesis que a la base de la decision del suicidio pudiese existir una real y clinicamente significativa condicion no ha sido valorada en su peso potencial. Emerge por tanto la necesidad de algunas breves reflexiones sobre la relacion entre fisica y depresion, que tengan en cuenta de cuanto la vivencia general de la enfermedad, el sufrimiento fisico, la experiencia del dolor y de la invalidez, la dificultad o la perdida de perspectivas futuras; puedan desempenar con elevada frecuencia el rol de factores capaces de activar una enfermedad psicologica depresiva, por otra parte todavia compatible con una vision lucida del propio estado y con una conservada capacidad de valoracion y decision. Pero los mismos factores, tambien eventualmente en asociacion con otros preexistentes o concomitantes, pueden conducir al desarrollo de reales y graves episodios depresivos, incluso clinicamente no distinguibles de aquellos que caracterizan la depresiva de origen primario, o sea no consecuente con la somatica. De la idea de la muerte, en el primer caso esperada y tambien vivida en sentido al menos en parte liberador, pero no deseada y no buscada, se pasa al deseo de morir, potencial grave sintoma depresivo, a su vez conexo en modo directo con el riesgo de conductas suicidas. El limite entre las dos condiciones es obviamente incierto y vago, justificado tambien por el modo disimulado y gradual con el cual se instaura la verdadera condicion que hace frecuentemente inesperado el eventual suicidio. Con la debida atencion a no psiquiatrizar conductas o situaciones no necesariamente de por si patolgogicas, la repercusion etica y deontologica de esta dicotomia es directa. Al derecho de eleccion del enfermo somatico, el cual se ha de tener en cuenta obviamente en los limites del contexto etico general y de las normas legales, debe ser antepuesto el derecho a la atencion medica del sujeto enfermo, cuyo sufrimiento mental limite o excluya su capacidad misma de valoracion y decision consciente El reconocimiento de la eventual real condicion depresiva y su tratamiento, entendido en el sentido mas estricto del termino, del farmacologico al de sustento psicologico o psicosocial, llegan a constituir necesidades eticas cuya minusvaloracion implica el riesgo de hacer perder, a un sujeto ya enfermo, la posibilidad de una ayuda decisiva en el afrontar o incluso superar momentos en los cuales al sufrimiento fisico y existencial se sobreponen condiciones de real sufrimiento mental, en modo tal que llegan a comprometer en grado incluso extremo las capacidades de libre y consciente eleccion, cuya recuperacion debe constituir un objetivo primario de toda intervencion terapeutica. EnglishThe work takes its cue from the reflection on the comments that have accompanied in the media about one year ago the suicide of a famous Italian director, a very old man, hospitalized for a malignant disease. A common attitude, here judged conformist and superficial, as proposed a highly positive evaluation of the gesture, presented essentially as an act of courage resulting in a lucid and coherent reflection on his own existential condition. But in reality a very simple view, the hypothesis that the basis of the decision of suicide could be a real and clinically significant depressive condition, as not been evaluated in all its potential weight. There is thus a need for some brief reflections on the relationship between physical illness and depression, which take account of how the general experience If the the physical suffering, the experience of pain and disability, the difficulty or loss of future prospects may play the role of factors that with a high frequency can trigger in patients a physiological depression disease, however, still compatible with a clear vision of their own condition and with a preserved capacity for evaluation a decision. But the same factors, also possibly in combination with other preexisting or concurrent, may lead to the development of real and severe depressive episodes, although not clinically distinguishable from those that characterize primary depressive illness, i.e. not resulting from physical disease. From the idea of in the first case pending and also lived at least in part in liberating sense, but not desired and sought after, you go the death wish, potential serious symptom of depression, in turn, directly linked with the risk of suicidal behavior. The boundary between the two conditions is obviously uncertain and vague, even justified by the subtle and gradual way in which the true condition of depression establishes, making often unexpected the eventual suicide. With proper care not to judge as psychiatric conduct or situation not necessarily pathological in itself, the ethical as well as deontological impact of this dichotomy is directed. The somatic patient's right to choose, to be considered within the context of the general ethical and legal regulations, must be placed after the right to the care deserved by an ill person, whose mental suffering can limit or exclude the same capacity of conscious evaluation and decision. The recognition of any real depressive condition and its treatment, in the broadest sense of the word, from the pharmacological therapy to the psychological and psychosocial support, constitute the ethical requirements which reduce the risk of making an already suffering person devoid of the possibility of a decisive help in dealing with or even go through moments in which the physical and existential suffering overlap conditions of real mental such to potentially compromise the ability of free and in-formed choice, whose recovery must be the primary objective of any therapeutic intervention.",

      "abstract": "Establishment of residual cognitive and psychotic effects (effects present at the time that all active cannabinoids are eliminated from the body) putatively produced by prolonged heavy cannabis use is difficult, because of many confounding variables like slow elimination of active cannabinoids, lack of supervision during abstinence, poor use of well-matched control groups and the presence of withdrawal symptoms. Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has shown that depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis are more common than previously supposed in elderly populations without dementia. It is unclear whether the frequency of these disorders increases or decreases with age. Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important. Psychiatric disorders, common among the elderly, have consequences that include social deprivation, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, disability, increased risk for somatic disorders, suicide, and increased nonsuicidal mortality.",

      "abstract": "AbstractGambling disorders are a serious public health problem. This manuscript will provide a comprehensive overview on this topic. Gambling disorder involves repeated patterns of gambling behaviors, that result in significant distress or impairment in a person’s interpersonal relationships, employment, educational/career opportunities, and finances over a period of 12 months. Gambling is defined as an activity that involves risking something of value with the hopes of acquiring something of greater value. Comparable to substance use disorders, individuals with a gambling disorder may be unsuccessful in exercising control over their problematic behavior, engage in the behavior despite negative consequences, and have preoccupations/cravings to gamble. Gambling disorder has higher comorbidity rates of mental disorders including depression, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders. Gamblers rarely seek treatment. Treatments must be tailored to the individual which may include psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, gamblers anonymous, and psychopharmacological agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and opioid antagonists to treat clinical symptoms.

There is no evidence, however, for a direct relationship between specific hormone alterations and psychiatric, nosologic entities in the critical periods (premenstrual, postpartum, menopausal). The menopausal psychosyndrome can develop as a result of a chain reaction triggered by the fairly universal and specific vasomotor symptoms: hot flushes and night sweats. The hormone substitution therapy of menopause may have a prompt effect both on the somatic and psychic symptoms, by suspending the domino effect.

      "abstract": "Depression is a common emotional state in humans, which is sometimes triggered by stressful events and certain physical and/or mental conditions that may occur and may increase the body's vulnerability to various types of depressive disorders, causing sometimes organic changes difficult to quantify and to treat. Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

The concept of psychic regression, initiated and driven by a motivation loss, requires a reassessment of the family links and of the patients-carers relationships. The relative part of conative depression, dysexecutive syndrome, and psychic regression is difficult to assess in old subjects on account of the complexity of the involved mechanisms (psychological aging, affective and relational history of the subject, family and environmental interactions). Lack of motivation and social dependency in old people result from a failure of the psychological mechanism of elaboration. We present a phenomenological point of view and advance some propositions for their prevention. Loss of motivation appears to be an acquired and dynamic process resulting from the psychological difficulties experienced by the individual due to the loss of autonomy and an increasing dependency which is not accepted although, paradoxically, searched for. This ambivalence results in loss of motivation and psychic regression which belongs to the non cognitive disorders of elderly people.",

      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

Unmanaged UI decreases quality of life and increases the risk of perineal skin breakdown, which can lead to painful skin irritation and pressure sores. Identifying the type of UI, and treating or eliminating transient causes as a result of acute conditions or medications, are initial steps in appropriate management. Health professionals can identify medication-related causes by reviewing the patient history, diagnoses, symptoms, and medication regimen. Chronic UI is often caused by physiological changes in the bladder; increasing age also can result in changes in bladder and urethral compliance. Other UI risk factors include impaired function, cognition, mobility, and dexterity as well as neurodegenerative damage that affect the patient's ability to toilet or recognize the need to toilet. Chronic or persistent UI is classified as stress, urge, overflow, functional, or mixed. Treatment options for chronic UI are discussed in detail.Pharmacists can have a positive impact on this condition by recommending appropriate medication changes and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.",

El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

They make several problems which lead to struggles be it the patient with himself or with people surrounding him. Amongst the most known and dangerous diseases is kidney failure which is included at the last stage of kidney disease; The kidney completely loses its function and work leading by this to dialysis with medical equipments and apparatus. Undoubtedly, the patient, at the time of being acquainted with the disease, is exposed to psychological trauma such as: not accepting and not adapting to the disease. Following by social problems by time owed to the fact that the patient will not play his ordinary role whether inside the family or outside it leading him accordingly to pressures preventing him from adapting to the social reality. Therefore, we pose the following question: What are the major psychological and social problems that patients with kidney failure are suffering from?",

      "title": "Compulsive sexual behavior in depressed women",
      "abstract": "Sir, Compulsive sexual behaviour (CSB) disorder though at an increasing trend is still unexplored due to the lots of stigma attached to it. It is associated with numerous comorbidities- such as organic conditions (frontal lobe syndrome), medications (dopamine), substance use disorder, mania, psychosis, and personality disorders.[1] It disorder is characterized by persistent and repetitive sexual impulses or urges that are experienced as irresistible or uncontrollable, leading to repetitive sexual behaviors (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] 11 Draft).[2] These symptoms are covered under F 52.7, i.e., excessive sexual drive in the ICD-10 and in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, it can be diagnosed through code 302.70, i.e., as unspecified sexual dysfunction. In the present case, the author would like to highlight the presence of hypersexuality in females primarily suffering from depression. A 42 year-old widow, resident of Delhi, presented to our department with chief complaints of sadness of mood, loneliness, crying spells, excessive guilt, disturbed sleep, and death wishes from the past 6 months. On probing why she was having this guilt, she disclosed to be very embarrassed for her deeds she can't control of, but never explained in details even after repeated psychiatric consultation. She finally decided to disclose this time due to extreme distress caused to her every day. She presented with a strong desire to involve in sexual act with any men with associated guilt with failed distraction techniques such as watching pornography, self-stimulation, consulting her close friend, and locking herself, but nothing helped. She also reported traveling in crowded places to touch men inappropriately and to experience what it felt like, leading to involvement with approximately ten strangers in the past 2-month period. She even tried contacting paid sex workers but backed out at the end, thinking that she might get AIDS. She also reported that, whenever any male would come near to her, she would have a strong impulse to touch him, and she would do it even if her daughter/friend is sitting near to her. When she revealed all these behaviors to her friend, she advised to consult a psychiatrist, after which the patient came to our department. There was no history suggestive of decreased self-care, any attempt to harm her, repetitive thought of checking/cleaning/doubt, strong urge for fire setting/hair pulling/gambling/stealing, and any unusual sexual preferences. There was no significant medical/surgical or family history. Her general and systemic examination was normal and on mental status examination, she reported her mood as sad. There were ideas of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness, but there were no suicidal ideations with delusions or hallucinations. Her routine blood investigations, thyroid function tests, electroencephalogram, and magnetic resonance imaging brain were normal. Her HIV status and viral markers were seronegative. On detailed assessment, she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with excessive sexual drive according to the ICD-10. She was started on oral treatment with selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine 20 mg and its dosage was increased to 60 mg in 2 months' period along with the behavior therapy. After about 8 months of treatment, she is almost 80% improved and regularly following up in the outpatient department. In the current case, the patient was primarily suffering from depressive symptoms with increased sexual urges. CSB is associated with constant association with sexual activity despite the awareness of its negative consequences. This behavior acts as a defense to cope up with the life stressors.[3] The present case is an attempt to emphasize the increasing trend of CSB. In a study on 36 patients with CSB by Black et al., depression was the second most common comorbidity after anxiety.[4] In a study by Raymond et al., 100% of the cases of CSB had Axis I diagnosis, with the most common being major depression (58%) and sexual dysfunction (46%).[5] Regarding the treatment of such cases, no drug is Food and Drug Administration approved till now. Studies have seen improvement with SSRIs, naltrexone, mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic acid), anti-androgens, and psychotherapy. The purpose of this case report is to sensitize clinicians of this condition as despite the increasing trend, CSB is still underreported and goes unrecognized. It will also aid in developing the operational definition for diagnosing CSB. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "abstract": "It is recognized that patients with anorexia nervosa commonly have other psychiatric illnesses. No study, to our knowledge, has determined whether these other psychiatric disorders occur prior to the age of onset of anorexia nervosa. We obtained a retrospective history from 24 subjects who were long term (more than 1 year) recovered from anorexia nervosa. We found that 58% reported that they had the onset of one or more childhood anxiety disorder diagnoses at the age of 10 +/- 5 years old. This was 5 years before the mean age of onset of anorexia nervosa. The onset of depression was about 1 year before the onset of anorexia nervosa in about one half the subjects. Alcohol and substance abuse/dependency tended to occur after the onset of anorexia nervosa and only occurred in anorexic subjects who binged and/or purged. The early and common onset of childhood anxiety disorders in a substantial percentage of anorexics raises the possibility that childhood anxiety disorders herald the first behavioral expression of a biologic vulnerability in some subjects who develop anorexia nervosa.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background/Aim: The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the findings and conclusions presented in existing literature articles pertaining to mental illnesses in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Patients and Methods: The study used a patients and methods approach. The study also comprised studies and papers that provided information on clinical aspects, as well as links and correlations between Parkinson’s disease and mental illnesses. Results: Symptoms of mental disorders are extremely prevalent in PD, but they are frequently undetected, undertreated, and overlooked if not evaluated precisely. Neuropsychiatric disorders of Parkinson’s disease divide into a number of major groups: anxiety and mood disorders, psychosis, behavioral modifications such as sexual disorders, impulse control disorders, dopaminergic medication abuse, and sleeping disorders. Conclusion: The majority of mental health conditions in PD are treatable, and failure to do so has a negative impact. Numerous investigations demonstrate that psychiatric symptoms influence the quality of life more than motor manifestations. Depression seems to be associated with deterioration in cognitive performance, tasks associated with everyday living, and motor performance and might have the greatest influence on the quality of life in PD. Psychosis is the leading cause of caretaker concern and a significant predictor of nursing residence relocation. The objective of therapy for mental illnesses in PD ought to include remission; inadequate treatment must be avoided.",

      "abstract": "The “menopause” (not menopause, the cessation of menses) mechanism responsible for its symptom complex (Menopausal Symptom Complex) (or, Climacteric Syndrome) including chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, depression, tension headache, cervical vertigo, sleep disturbances, irritability, anxiety/panic attacks, cognitive changes (decreased concentration to obsessional/delusional thought), decreased libido, and vasomotor dysfunction remains elusive. And MSC, other than vasomotor dysfunction, is not significantly altered by treatment with sex hormones (estrogen/progesterone), which have major neoplastic and vascular side effects. Thus at present, there are minimal indications for treatment with these compounds. Confusion between menopause and “menopause” (MSC) as well as research money made available by pharma advocating ERT/HRT (estrogen replacement therapy/hormone replacement therapy) has produced both therapeutic and research inertia. Presently, there would appear to be mismanagement of a symptom complex which infers primary brainlimbic system dysfunction and for which there is no correlation with falling sex hormone levels. Pharmacological modification of the proposed aberrant limbic circuitry responsible for the MSC has been successfully accomplished using specific NT/MMs (neurotransmission/modulation modifiers) i.e. a combination of alpha-1 and norepinephrine reuptake blockers, and thus providing initial elucidation of this particular brain pathophysiology as well as an efficient treatment of a problem affecting up to 60% of women ages 35 to 55. Specific NT/MMs capable of affecting a number of neurotransmitter/receptor types within limbic circuitry appear to reverse the MSC which includes chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, pointing to aberrant limbic circuitry as their etiology as well.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

Therefore, little is known about the real prevalence, pathophysiology or etiology of Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. In addition, since there is no study conducted in this field, our information in this area is limited to case reports. Although there is no consensus about the treatment of Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder in the psychiatric literature, there are some case reports about the use of pregabaline, clomipramine, duloxetine, clonazepam, varenicline, olanzapine, risperidone in addition to the case reports on treatment with hypnotherapy, pelvic floor physiotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this case report, we aimed to present the detailed description of a successful treatment procedure with duloxetine in a forty two years old female patient diagnosed with Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. She had been using various antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and mood stabilizers for sixteen years with different psychiatric misdiagnoses like Bipolar Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder and yet, had not shared her symptoms of genital arousal with any psychiatrist previously.",

      "title": "Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders",
      "abstract": "Children who are impulsive, inattentive, or overactive frequently are referred to pediatricians for evaluation and treatment. Approximately 5% of girls and 10% of boys of elementary age may qualify for a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), but some will have problems that mimic AD/HD or are comorbid with it. An appropriate diagnostic evaluation is the foundation for a management program that integrates parent/patient education, behavior management, interventions for social/emotional issues, academic programming, and medication when indicated.AD/HDs are chronic neuro-behavioral disorders that can interfere with an individual's ability to inhibit behavior (impulsivity), function efficiently in goal-oriented activities (inattention), or regulate the activity level(hyperactivity) in developmentally appropriate ways. The plural term AD/HDs is used in this article to emphasize the heterogeneity of this population. Core symptoms and related problems occur along a continuum and manifest in various combinations and within specific family, academic, and social contexts. Multiple etiologic factors are implicated, with strong evidence for a genetic predisposition that interacts dynamically with the environment to produce the clinical features. Comorbidity is common and has a substantial impact on functioning, treatment, and prognosis. Symptoms of AD/HD emerge in early childhood and continue to be present into adulthood in up to 70% of cases.The underlying deficit remains unclear. Several theories are being debated, including AD/HD as a disorder of central behavioral disinhibition, an information processing dysfunction, or a poor adaptation to a particular environment. Although neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies support the central role of the prefrontal lobes and basal ganglia in AD/HDs, no specific diagnostic measures are currently available. Diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical presentations and observable behaviors viewed within a developmental and psycho-social context.The symptom complex of AD/HD has been described for more than 100 years, although terminology has changed and controversy continues over definition and boundaries. The 1994 revision of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) contains the most widely accepted diagnostic criteria to date. Three behavioral subtypes are defined:predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive, and combined. The diagnostic behavioral criteria are presented in an unscored screening checklist (Table 1) that facilitates data collection from multiple sources. Criteria for inattention are listed in Scale A (#1–9), and those for hyperactivity-impulsivity are in Scale B (#10–18). At least six of the nine criteria from one or both sets should be excessive in frequency (often/very often) and to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level to make the diagnosis. Age and gender currently are not taken into account.The symptoms must be chronic and have persisted for more than 6 months. Some should be present before age 7. Children who have primarily symptoms associated with inattention and few behavior problems may not present until adolescence.The DSM-IV also requires pervasiveness of symptoms, with impairment of functioning in two or more settings (home,school, or with peers). However, it is unusual for a child to display the same level of dysfunction in all settings or within the same setting at all times. Symptoms typically worsen in situations that require sustained attention or mental effort and lack intrinsic appeal. They are more likely to occur in group activities. Signs may be minimized when the situation provides immediate reinforcement or novelty or is highly supervised, such as video games or a visit to the doctor.These symptoms are nonspecific,and the DSM-IV requires that they not be better accounted for by another disorder (eg, mood disorder), although AD/HDs can be comorbid with other conditions.Scale C (#19–25) lists screening questions that address commonly associated problems with compliance, socialization, emotional control, anxiety, mood, learning, and academic performance.In primary care settings, symptoms may not present with sufficient frequency or intensity to warrant a diagnosis of AD/HD or may represent only a variation in development. This continuum from normal variation to problem to disorder is recognized in the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Primary Care: Child and Adolescent Version(DSM-PC) that was developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, and the Society for Pediatric Psychology. The DSM-PC also outlines relevant differential diagnoses, comorbid conditions, developmental issues, and environmental factors that affect a child's functioning.A differential diagnosis must be undertaken because a variety of conditions and stressors present with poor concentration, behavioral disturbance, or academic dysfunction (Table 2). Many of the same conditions can be comorbid with AD/HDs. Most children who have AD/HDs underachieve in school, and many have difficulty with social interaction.Comorbidity patterns vary among subtypes and gender. The predominantly inattentive type often is associated with cognitive, academic, and emotional problems; behavioral problems,including aggression, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct problems,are observed more often in the hyperactive/impulsive subtype. Females tend to have more cognitive and fewer behavioral problems than do males. Research suggests that females are underidentified and, therefore, undertreated.The reciprocal interaction between children and their environment is always important. Children who have AD/HDs are more likely than those who do not to have a parent or sibling affected by AD/HD, substance abuse, depression, or anti-social behavior. The presence of a child who has AD/HD appears to increase family stress, social isolation, feelings of parental incompetence, and marital conflict. In school, these children often are highly sensitive to differences in the academic environment and teaching style. Peer interactions are affected in highly complex but important ways.A comprehensive, developmentally oriented evaluation is essential to clarify diagnostic issues, identify related problems, and understand the child's functioning within academic and psychosocial contexts (Table 3). Questionnaires and behavior rating scales can facilitate data collection and screen for multiple disorders in addition to AD/HDs (see Resources). Review of school records provides valuable longitudinal information, but collaboration with school personnel is necessary to assess the child's cognitive ability and current functioning. Schools are federally mandated to perform appropriate evaluations if a child is suspected of having a disability such as AD/HD or a learning disorder that impairs academic functioning.Findings on sensory, physical, and neurologic examinations are usually normal, but such assessments provide opportunities to observe the child's motor coordination, language skills, and social style. Behavioral observations should be interpreted cautiously because children may show few symptoms of AD/HD in this setting. Decisions to perform laboratory studies, such as a thyroid screen or electroencephalography,should be based on clinical indications. Measurement of lead levels and hematocrit concentrations should be considered in preschool children. Referral to a pediatric subspecialist or child psychiatrist may be indicated.Management of AD/HDs begins during the assessment process with establishing a team approach to treatment that includes the child, family, physician, school personnel, and others. This \"therapeutic alliance\" has substantial impact on acceptance and adherence to recommendations. The characteristics of each child and the stresses/resources within the family, school, and community must be considered when developing a multimodal treatment plan that integrates pediatric educational counseling with possible behavioral,emotional, academic, and medical interventions (BEAM). Treatment goals are summarized in Table 4. The short-term benefits and limitations of behavioral and pharmacological interventions have been demonstrated, but little is known of the long-term benefits of particular treatments or treatment combinations for individual patients. Medication should not be the only intervention for AD/HDs or a treatment of \"last resort.\" Further,medication should not be continued unless clear-cut benefits are observed.Pediatric educational counseling or \"demystification\" is the first step in an ongoing process of educating the family, child, and school personnel about chronic conditions. The physician manages the case, but the parents and eventually the child must become experts in \"individual management.\" Parents and children must understand that they did not cause this biologically based disorder,but they are responsible for its management. Practical ways of dispensing this information include information sheets, pamphlets, books, videos, and audiotapes (see Resource List). Educational counseling can be provided individually or in groups by the clinician, other professionals in the office (nurse, physician assistant, social worker, psychologist), or community mental health professionals. Parent support groups provide useful information about the condition, group support, and resources within the community and local school system.Behavioral interventions should include counseling about the impact of AD/HDs on behavior and response to discipline. Parents may need training in basic management or behavior modification. The child may benefit from social skills training or cognitive-behavioral therapies.Parents and teachers need to understand that children who have AD/HDs often are more difficult to manage because of a neurologically based impairment in the capacity to sustain attention, inhibit irrelevant or maladaptive responses to stimuli,or regulate their level of activity. Sensitivity to both positive and negative consequences is diminished, especially when the consequences are delayed. Demands for self-management increase with age, but many children who have AD/HDs are delayed in adaptive functioning. The increased rates of oppositional behaviors and emotional over-reactivity often contribute to spiraling, negative interactions.Basic management involves providing increased structure, giving clear directions, and using developmentally appropriate techniques. Training parents in behavior management has been shown to reduce the child's disruptive behavior, increase the adult's sense of competence, and decrease overall stress.Behavior modification involves the systematic application of techniques that target specific maladaptive behavior patterns at home or school. The most effective programs target a limited number of behaviors and provide prompt feedback, positive and negative consequences, and consistency across settings.These techniques begin with the \"ABC\" assessment of the specific behavior, which determines the antecedents that elicit that behavior, the observable specifics of the behavior (type, intensity, frequency), and the consequences that maintain it. A variety of strategies can be used to decrease less desirable behaviors (eg, hitting), increase more desirable behaviors (eg, using words instead of actions), or teach a new skill (eg,negotiating). Operant conditioning strategies used to modify the behaviors include increased positive attention (eg, \"time-in\"), punishment(eg, \"time-out\"), and \"selective ignoring.\" Charts or point systems that track specific behaviors can be useful.Training in social skills and cognitive-behavioral approaches combine instructing the child in specific social, problem-solving, or self-control skills and using behavior modification techniques to reinforce those skills. Studies show that these behavioral interventions can result in short-term improvement in targeted behaviors, but gains appear to be limited by failure to use learned skills independently, lack of maintenance once the intervention is discontinued, and the difficulty that adults have in sustaining behavior programs consistently.Emotional interventions address psychological, emotional, social, or family issues to improve adaptation and psychosocial functioning of children and their families. Strategies can include \"reframing,\" competency and social development, individual psychotherapy, family therapy, parental therapy, and support groups.The clinician can help families caught up in negative interactions by reframing problem behaviors (\"hyperactivity\") or temperament characteristics as positive traits (\"high energy\")that need to be regulated better. Areas of competence should be developed through hobbies and sports. Recreational activities can improve self-esteem and provide opportunities for positive social interaction. Individual psychotherapy has not been found effective for core symptoms of AD/HDs, but it may be indicated to treat demoralization, depression, anxiety,interpersonal problems, or psychosocial stressors such as parental divorce. Family therapy may be needed to address family dysfunction or facilitate behavior management, especially of adolescents. Therapy for the parents may be indicated when there is parental psychopathology or marital discord. Participation in support groups is very beneficial for families and individuals, especially the newly diagnosed.Academic underachievement is very common in AD/HDs, and at least 25% of children who have AD/HDs have specific learning disabilities. Disorders of higher cortical functions, memory, cognition, and language are also common. Problems with organization and productivity or inconsistent performance tend to increase in secondary school. Appropriate academic programming, effective classroom management, and good communication with school personnel are crucial. The majority of children who have AD/HDs can be taught within the mainstream, but some may require tutoring, resource room support, inclusion or blended classes, or self-contained special education. They may require speech/language therapy to address deficits in language processing. Graphomotor, fine motor, or gross motor dysfunctions are common and may require modified expectations or occupational therapy, physical therapy, or adaptive physical education services. Using computers, tape recorders, or calculators may improve productivity.Possible accomodations that can be undertaken in the general classroom are listed in Table 5. . Modifications may be needed at the classroom level (eg, assignments written on the boards),at the task level (eg, extended time), or at the individual level (eg,private signal when off-task). Providing opportunities to develop areas of expertise fosters respect for individual variations among students.AD/HDs now are considered disabilities under federal law and may qualify under the \"Other Health Impaired\" category for special education or related services under The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children who have AD/HDs but do not require special education services may qualify for appropriate accommodations within standard educational settings under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination against persons who have disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) may provide individuals who have AD/HDs with reasonable accommodations in secular private schools, postsecondary education, and the workplace.Medical problems that imitate AD/HD symptoms or compromise functioning must be identified and treated. Medical illnesses, drugs used to treat other conditions, or exacerbations of chronic conditions can cause deterioration of cognitive, behavioral, or academic functioning. Adequacy of sleep, nutrition, and exercise should be reviewed.Pharmacotherapy for AD/HD may be indicated when academic, behavioral, or social functioning is impaired significantly. The use of psychotropic medication in children has received a great deal of attention in the popular press. Parents,teachers, or children may have unrealistic fears or excessive expectations. The clinician must provide accurate information and obtain the cooperation of the parents, school, and child.Psychostimulants continue to be first-line medications for AD/HDs. Nonstimulant medications may be appropriate in some cases, but research on their use is limited and side effects appear to be more significant. The combination of stimulants with other medications should be approached carefully because of the lack of controlled data.Stimulants have been researched extensively since 1937, and stimulant use in the United States has almost tripled in recent years. In 1995, approximately 2.8% (1.5 million) of youths ages 5 to 18 years in the United States were receiving methylphenidate (MPH). The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry all have released statements about AD/HDs and their treatment in the last year.MPH accounts for more than 80% of stimulant prescriptions. Other stimulants include dextroamphetamine (DEX), pemoline, and a combination of amphetamine salts (Table 6). Stimulants act by increasing the intrasynaptic availability of dopamine and norepinephrine indirectly. MPH is an effective blocker of catecholamine reuptake, with stronger effects on dopamine than on norepinephrine. Amphetamines, such as DEX, both release cytoplasmic dopamine and block dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin reuptake. Pemoline pharmacology is less well understood, but it also is believed to block dopamine reuptake. It is dissimilar in structure from the other stimulants.Stimulants have been shown to have significant short-term benefits in at least 70% to 80% of children who have AD/HDs. If alternative stimulants and a wide range of dosages are tried, the response rate increases to 85% to 90%. However, long-term improvements in behavior or academic performance have not been demonstrated.Stimulant medications temporarily improve the core symptoms of inattention,impulsivity, and hyperactivity, but they also affect motor, social, and emotional functioning (Table 7). In general, cognitive and behavioral measures improve with increasing doses within the usual therapeutic range. Dose-response curves appear to vary significantly among individuals and among cognitive, behavioral, and academic domains within an individual.Side effects of stimulants are generally dose-dependent and mild to moderate in severity (Table 8). Most are related to the adrenergic activity of the medications. It is important to obtain baseline assessment of symptoms because sleep and appetite problems are common in children who have AD/HDs. Profiles and severity of side effects will vary among individuals and the stimulant used. Most side effects are transient or manageable by changing the timing, dosage, or formulation of the stimulant.Behavioral rebound, characterized by increased irritability and activity,may occur as the last dose is wearing off. A small additional dose may be beneficial in the afternoon and usually does not prolong sleep onset. A few children benefit from a small, additional dose in the evening if the return of AD/HD symptoms interferes with settling down to sleep.The development of tics or dyskinesias is an infrequent side effect of stimulants. There is no evidence that stimulants produce permanent tic disorders. About 50% to 60% of children who have Tourette syndrome (TS) also have AD/HD, which often presents 2 to 3 years before the onset of tics. When the use of stimulants is being considered for children who have motor tics or a family history of tics, parents should be advised that most children benefit from moderate doses of stimulants without unacceptable worsening of tics. Although stimulants do not lower the seizure threshold, theoretically they can alter blood levels of anticonvulsants.Appetite suppression is common with stimulant use and may result in transitory effects on weight and rare interference with height velocity. There is no evidence of any effect on adolescent growth or ultimate adult height. \"Drug holidays\" to counterbalance this effect are not routinely indicated; appetite suppression often diminishes over time. If medication-related growth effects are suspected, modifying dosage or scheduling, increasing caloric intake, or instituting medication-free periods may be appropriate. Stimulants may be taken with meals.There is no evidence that substance abuse results from properly prescribed stimulants for adolescents who have AD/HDs. The risk is increased when conduct disorder is comorbid. If the risk of drug abuse by patient, peers, or family is high, pemoline or nonstimulant medication may be preferable.Pemoline is associated with a risk of chemical hepatitis that may be as high as 3%, but fulminant liver failure is rare. Monitoring of liver function upon initiation of treatment and at least every 6 months often is recommended, but the onset of hepatitis cannot be predicted.Appropriate management of medication begins with identification of the specific target symptoms that are expected to improve and a discussion of the limitations of medication with the child and parents. There are three stages of pharmacotherapy: initial titration,maintenance, and termination.Titration of medication is required to determine efficacy and optimal dosage. Dosage requirements do not always correlate with weight, age, or severity of symptoms. Further, response to stimulants is not diagnostic of AD/HDs; unaffected children and adults show qualitatively similar responses. Both positive and negative placebo effects have been reported.The usual dosage range for MPH is 0.3 to 0.8 mg/kg given two to three times a day. The dose for DEX is 50% of that of MPH. The daily dose of pemoline is approximately 1.5 times the total daily dose of MPH.The most commonly used titration is open trial (nonblinded). The usual starting dose for school-age children is 5 mg of MPH given at or just after meals. Dosage adjustments of 2.5 to 5 mg are made weekly until therapeutic effect or adverse effects occur. We typically begin with only a morning dose and compare differential behaviors in morning and afternoon to determine response and the need for additional doses. Most children will require either a second dose at school or a long-acting preparation. Many benefit from a third dose after school for homework, after-school activities,or behavioral control at home. Some require medication only on school days,but many benefit from daily medication when their symptoms impair functioning at home or with peers. Dosages and schedules must be individualized. Combined long- and short-acting stimulants may be useful.Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials can be useful in clinical practice to evaluate medication efficacy, especially when there are strong biases either for or against medication use. Rating scales, such as the ADD-H Comprehensive Teacher's Rating Scale (ACTeRs) or the revised Conners Parent and Teacher Rating Scale (see Resources) can be completed by the parents and teachers to monitor treatment response. It is important to obtain a baseline rating and at least weekly assessments during a trial. Narrative comments from teachers are often most informative. In secondary school, it is useful to obtain feedback from two teachers because multiple factors influence behavior at that age. Children and adolescents should be involved in any discussion of a medication trial.Efficacy cannot be determined by behavior during an office visit. The use of computer-based continuous performance tests for clinical diagnosis or medication response is appealing,but raises serious concerns because of low specificity and sensitivity and multiple factors affecting performance. Blood levels are not useful for monitoring stimulant therapy.Nonstimulant medications may be beneficial in children who respond poorly to an adequate trial of stimulants, experience unacceptable stimulant side effects, or have comorbid conditions (tics, anxiety, mood disorder) (Table 9). The nonstimulant medications have not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for advertising as safe and effective treatment of AD/HDs, but controlled studies and clinical data support cautious \"off-label\" use.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)that have been studied for AD/HDs include imipramine and desipramine, with renewed interest in nortriptyline. Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that TCAs are efficacious in 60% to 70% of children who have AD/HDs. Those who have AD/HDs and comorbid anxiety, depression, or tic disorders may respond better to TCAs than to stimulants. Hyperactivity/impulsivity, anxiety, and moodiness can decrease within several days, but full response may take several weeks. Improvement in cognitive symptoms (inattention) has not been documented objectively, and effects seem to be short-lived for some children.Anticholinergic side effects, such as dry mouth or constipation, tend to be well tolerated (prior to adolescence), but increase dose-dependently. TCAs can lower the seizure threshold. Potentially serious cardiovascular side effects, especially induction of arrhythmias, are possible. Six cases of sudden death in children taking desipramine have been reported, but a causal relationship has not been established. Because of these concerns, TCAs are contraindicated for patients who have a history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia or a family history of sudden death,unexplained syncope, or early cardiac disease.The starting dose for imipramine is generally 10 to 25 mg (0.3 mg/kg)at bedtime and increased by 10 to 25 mg every 4 to 7 days up to a target dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg per day divided in two or three doses. Many authors recommend baseline and follow-up electrocardiography. Persistent tachycardia, significant intraventricular conduction delay, or QTc greater than 460 msec necessitates reassessment. A trough blood level at steady-state can be useful to assess compliance and toxicity but not therapeutic response when treating AD/HDs. A possible therapeutic window (50 to 150 ng/mL) has been described for nortriptyline for depression, but not for AD/HDs.Patients who metabolize TCAs slowly may be more vulnerable to developing toxic levels. Toxicity may manifest as mania, irritability,sedation, aggression, palpitations, confusion, or rarely a seizure. Medication should be discontinued slowly to minimize discomfort from anticholinergic rebound. Parents should be made aware that an overdose could be fatal.Bupropion is a heterocylic anti-depressant with dopaminergic activity similar to stimulants. It shows modest efficacy in decreasing hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. It may increase tics and decrease seizure threshold. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, have generated interest,but there is little evidence of efficacy on the core symptoms of AD/HDs, although they may be useful for comorbid conditions. Venlafaxine, a mixed serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor,may have some efficacy in AD/HDs.Although controlled studies in AD/HDs have been limited, a positive behavioral response to clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is reported in up to 50% of patients. The best responders tend to be those who are overaroused,easily frustrated, extremely hyperactive, or aggressive. Clonidine has been used as a first-line treatment in children who have comorbid tics or TS or as an alternative to stimulants when there are severe side effects. Clonidine is not as effective as stimulants for cognitive symptoms. It may be useful in AD/HD-related sleep problems or in combination with stimulants,although there are concerns about the safety of this practice.Clonidine is initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg at bedtime and is increased gradually to minimize side effects to a total daily dose of 0.1 to 0.3 mg in two to four divided doses. Several weeks may be required for significant clinical improvement. Clonidine also may be administered by transdermal patch. Efficacy may wear off in 5 days rather than the 7 days stated by the manufacturer. The side effect reported most frequently is sedation. Blood pressure may decrease by 10%, but rarely is clinically significant. Depression can occur, particularly in children who have depressive symptoms or a family history of mood disorder. Contact dermatitis occurs with the transdermal patch in more than 25% of cases. Clonidine should be withdrawn gradually to avoid hypertensive reactions or withdrawal symptoms such as agitation and headache.Guanfacine is a more selective alpha-2a agonist. Preliminary studies indicate that it may have a longer half-life than clonidine, permitting once- or twice-daily dosing and less sedation.Antipsychotic medications are not currently recommended for AD/HDs because of potentially serious adverse effects. Haloperidol may be useful for treating tics or TS and may be combined with a stimulant to address comorbid AD/HDs. Carbamazepine and valproate are not generally used for AD/HDs, although rare patients who experience severe aggressive outbursts or comorbid bipolar disorder may benefit from their use.Families frequently explore alternative treatments that lack scientific validation. Dietary treatments have been a source of controversy and extensive investigation. Methodically rigorous studies show that fewer than 5% of patients exhibit behavioral improvement on restrictive diets. Electroencephalographic-biofeedback training continues to be an unproven and expensive treatment for which no well-controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy. Other unpro",

      "abstract": "Introduction: In schizophrenia prodrome, when symptoms frequently resemble those of depressive illnesses, it creates a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, especially if it is late onset. This also has treatment implications in old age. Case presentation: A 65-year-old female who presented with mood and psychotic symptoms pose diagnostic dilemma. Careful history, collateral examination and continual exploration were done for accurate diagnosis and proper management. Due to overlapping symptoms, the initial diagnosis of psychotic depression was revised to paranoid schizophrenia. Eventually, the detailed examination, neurological and laboratory work up were done and the treatment approach was adjusted. The diagnostic dilemma appeared during the initial stage of the late onset psychosis due to affective symptoms. This case emphasises the critical role of clinical acumen in identifying the possibility of schizophrenia and other psychoses, ruling out organic aetiology and balancing the need of psychotropic drugs in old age.",

      "abstract": "The question of awareness, the capacity to judge the consequences of ones certain act or behaviour is a hard and typical problem in forensic medicine and neuro-psychiatry. Analysing such questions is indispensable during criminal actions where the responsibility and culpability of the offender is to be considered. The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness. The alcoholic state does not limit culpability, while epileptic disturbance of consciousness may exempt the offender.",

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales en el insomnio crónico",
      "abstract": "Little is known about the cognitive and emotional alterations associated with chronic insomnia.After reviewing the aetiology and pathophysiology of chronic insomnia, taking into account the patient's vulnerability and its inheritability, this study reports on the knowledge currently held about the cognitive deficits and emotional alterations observed in patients with chronic insomnia.Most aetiological models include factors that predispose an individual to insomnia, as well as precipitating and maintaining it. Predisposing factors can be of a biological or psychosocial nature. One predisposing factor that plays an important role is the vulnerability to insomnia, which is related to a non-adaptive way of coping with stress (focused on the emotion rather than on the problem) and the internalisation of negative emotions, which favours a state of physiological, cognitive and emotional hyperactivation that disrupts sleep and may lead to insomnia. This vulnerability is largely hereditary. Two phenotypes, based on the objective duration of sleep, have been described, the difference between them being the severity of the disorder. Insomniacs with an objective sleep time below six hours present significant cognitive deficits. These become manifest in tasks that require a large number of cognitive resources, complex attention tasks, changes in the focus of attention, the process of consolidation of memory during sleep, and working memory. These data suggest the existence of a prefrontal dysfunction. Comorbidity between insomnia and anxiety-depression is high. The anxiety-depression triggered by the internalisation of emotions predisposes the individual to insomnia and this, in turn, intensifies the depression.Alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales en el insomnio cronico.Introduccion. Las alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales asociadas al insomnio cronico son poco conocidas. Desarrollo. Tras revisar la etiologia y fisiopatologia del insomnio cronico, considerando la vulnerabilidad a este y su heredabilidad, se describe el estado actual de conocimientos acerca de los deficits cognitivos y las alteraciones emocionales observados en el insomnio cronico. Conclusiones. La mayoria de los modelos etiologicos incluye factores que predisponen al insomnio, que lo precipitan y que lo mantienen. Los factores predisponentes pueden ser de tipo biologico o psicosocial. Un factor predisponente que desempeña un importante papel es la vulnerabilidad al insomnio, que se relaciona con un modo no adaptativo de afrontar el estres (centrado en la emocion en vez de en el problema) y la internalizacion de las emociones negativas, lo cual favorece un estado de hiperactivacion fisiologica, cognitiva y emocional que altera el sueño y puede desembocar en insomnio. Esta vulnerabilidad es en gran parte hereditaria. Se han descrito dos fenotipos, basados en la duracion objetiva del sueño, que difieren en la gravedad del trastorno. Los insomnes con duracion objetiva del sueño menor de seis horas presentan deficits cognitivos significativos. Estos se manifiestan en tareas que requieren gran cantidad de recursos cognitivos, tareas de atencion complejas, cambio de foco de atencion, proceso de consolidacion de la memoria durante el sueño y memoria operativa. Estos datos sugieren la existencia de una disfuncion prefrontal. Se da una alta comorbilidad entre insomnio y ansiedad-depresion. La ansiedad-depresion provocada por la internalizacion de las emociones predispone al insomnio, y este, a su vez, intensifica la depresion.",

      "abstract": "Autistic disorder, a pervasive developmental disorder resulting in social, language, or sensorimotor deficits, occurs in approximately seven of 10,000 persons. Early detection and intervention significantly improve outcome, with about one third of autistic persons achieving some degree of independent living. Indications for developmental evaluation include no babbling, pointing, or use of other gestures by 12 months of age, no single words by 16 months of age, no two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months of age, and loss of previously learned language or social skills at any age. The differential diagnosis includes other psychiatric and pervasive developmental disorders, deafness, and profound hearing loss. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Common comorbidities include mental retardation, seizure disorder, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Behavior modification programs are helpful and are usually administered by multidisciplinary teams, targeted medication is used to address behavior concerns. Many different treatment approaches can be used, some of which are unproven and have little scientific support.

For Mr. H, irritability, anxiety, and delusion are related both to the personal history of the patient and his wife. They are also the consequences of the cognitive deficit and the patient psychological reaction to the perception of his memory loss. Mr. H. has a major loss of self-initiated behavior and interest.

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

El presente trabajo valida una herramienta para el diagnostico y posterior tratamiento de estas autolesiones sin intencion suicida.

Existen igualmente diferencias de genero entre hombres y mujeres tanto en el tipo de autolesion como en el nivel de la misma. EnglishSelf - injury behaviors have been related to different syndromes of anxiety, depression, attempted suicide and consummate suicide, bullying, and physical and/or sexual abuse. Similarly, this symptomatology has also been linked to syndromes that do not necessarily lead to an attempted suicide such as substance use and abuse, autism or schizophrenia. In this sense, these self - injury behaviors have been related to affective or attention need. The present study validates a questionnaire for the diagnosis, and subsequent treatment, of these self - injuries without suicidal intent. The results show that there are two sub - dimensions of self - injury: Self - injury above the skin and Self - injury below the skin.

      "title": "A Case Report of Schizoaffective Disorder with Pseudoseizures in a 42-year-old Male",
      "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), historically referred to as pseudoseizures or hysterical seizures, are sudden disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

      "title": "Psychogenic Urinary Retention",
      "abstract": "The literature on psychogenic urinary retention is reviewed. 2 cases treated by analytical psychotherapy are reported, in which significant demand for physical punishment was revealed and seen as linked to unacceptable, unconscious sadistic and aggressive feelings. Some psychodynamic aspects of what is considered to be 'a disturbance of internal body space' are discussed. Psychogenic urinary retention has received little attention in the literature. It may represent the uneasy position this disorder of bodily function occupies in clinical practice, with clear physical symptoms and associated psychological factors. The condition is more frequent in females, usually young adults. Case histories regularly record the placid, passive presentation of these patients, childhood enuresis and disturbed backgrounds. The diagnosis, 'hysteric', is frequent and most psychodynamic evaluations suggest the symptom represents a displacement of unacceptable sexual wishes and impulse. 2 patients treated by analytical psychotherapy are reported who, whilst fulfilling many of the criteria already noted, additionally revealed an intense desire for physical punishment. This punitive demand had less to do with unacceptable sexual wishes, than guilt at repressed aggressive drives of considerable magnitude. The role of aggression in the genesis of psychogenic urinary retention has so far been little studied.",

Treatment of this conditions\r\nInvolves dietary adjustments, regular medications and regular dialysis\r\nOr renal transplantation. For several reasons, renal transplantation is not\r\nA easily available option. Patient may not be able to procure a stuitable\r\nKidney, age and other medical conditions may debar the patient from\r\nThat treatment option leaving him with the only option of regular\r\nDialysis.\r\nDialysis as a procedure, either hemodialysis or peritoneal\r\nDialysis or other ambulatory dialysis methods involves several physical\r\nAs well as psychological trauma that will lead to various psychiatric\r\nIllness which in turn imapairs the quality of life of these patients. The\r\nPatient will have to tolerate the loss of independence, dependence on\r\nThe dialysis machines, rigorous drug regimens involving drugs like\r\nMultiviatamins, phosphate binders, calcium supplements, iorn\r\nSupplements, errthropoietin injections…etc, and not to forget the\r\nFinancial burden. But even a good compliance to these treatment\r\nProcedures are not found to produce to a meaningful productivity and\r\nQuality of life. The “X” factor in most of these situations has been\r\nIdentified as psychological impairments. Hence now adequate\r\nPrograms has been put in place in several countries for the regular\r\nScreening for these impairments among ESRD patients.\r\nDepression has been identified as the most common psychiatric\r\nDisorder prevalent among this group of patients, and its role in causing\r\nMorbidity and mortality in these patients has been studied in detail. Old\r\nAge, pain, comorbid medical or surgical conditions, financial stresses,\r\nPoor social support, have been identified as few important factors that\r\nPredispose the patients to depression and other other psychological\r\nImpairments. Suicide is one feared outcome due to the presence of\r\nDepression among the ESRD patients.

      "title": "Paternal Postnatal Depression - a review",
      "abstract": "Objective. Among the factors responsible for the occurrence of paternal postnatal depression (PPD), the following are the most frequent: biological factors (mainly hormonal changes), psychological factors (mainly a specific personal profile, including neuroticism, perfectionism and obsessiveness, mental disorders and problems such as anxiety or mental disorders, marital coincidence of depression, a high level of stress experienced and lower quality of sexual life in the postpartum period), and finally – socioeconomic status (mainly poverty, young age of the spouse, his low level of education and structural problems in the family). However, it should be noticed that the subject of paternal postnatal depression is relatively rarely taken up in research or discussed in specialist magazines. Conclusions. However, due to the fact that postnatal depression, both in mothers and in fathers, greatly impacts the life of the child and the functioning of the family, it seems that this area of research is of crucial importance. The identification of risk factors of depression in new fathers may not only lead to a more profound understanding and description of the etiology and symptomatology of paternal postnatal depression, but also to distinguishing a risk group in order to provide it with professional prevention and therapeutic care.",

Although, it is being researched for more than half a century there is still no clear definition of Dhat syndrome and characterized by excessive preoccupation with loss of Dhat, which is generally taken to be representing semen and attribution of physical and psychological symptoms. It is usually seen in young, unmarried, or recently married men of rural background with conservative attitude toward sex, generally belong to low or medium socio-economic status and education level. It can be treated with anxiolytics, antidepressants, as well as psychological interventions such as psycho-education, sex education, counseling, and cognitive behavior therapy. There is long debate regarding the nosological position of the disease and recent call for attention of psychiatrists in the subcontinent to revisit the nosological status of dhat syndrome with an unbiased mind. Further, systematic studies on the phenomenology of Dhat syndrome is needed to clarify it, especially keeping in mind the extent of the problem in the subcontinent and the distress and dysfunction it results in. \r\nKey Words: Dhat Syndrome, Cultural Bound Syndrome, Indian Subcontinent, Bangladesh",

      "title": "Are antidepressants effective in cancer patients?",
      "abstract": "Much work has been carried out to evaluate the physical sequelae of cancer, but relatively little research has been carried out into the psychological and psychiatric sequelae. Depression is a significant symptom for many palliative care patients but is under recognised and frequently not treated (1–3). Depression is characterised by persistent low mood (dysphoria) and loss of interest in activities (anhedonia). The clinical diagnosis of depression is made according to criteria, e.g. DSM-IV criteria. Depression is an illness with no distinct biological markers or effective diagnostic test. The physician must rely upon skill and knowledge in differentiating depression from ‘appropriate sadness’ or grief reactions as the end of life approaches (4). Low mood can be seen as a continuous variable in cancer patients. Physicians need to seek symptoms actively and not expect the patient to report them spontaneously. Non-disclosure by the patient may occur for a number of reasons. The cancer patient may already feel stigmatised and the physician may believe that the added label of depression may enhance stigmatisation and, therefore, mental suffering; however, most patients are accepting of treatment (5). Physicians may attribute somatic symptoms of depression to the cancer illness, highlighting their tendency to separate mental from physical health as described by Tucker (6). Block (7) suggested hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, guilt and suicidal ideation as better indicators of depression. The diagnosis of depression relies on clinical judgement. However, poor detection remains a significant problem; Maguire (8) stated that up to 80% of developed psychological morbidity remains unrecognised and untreated. A study in 2004 by Lawrie et al. (9) found that whilst 73% of palliative care physicians routinely assessed for depression, 61% reported difficulties with assessment and management of depression and wanted more training in this area. The treatment of depression can improve quality of life and also the palliation of other symptoms. All patients identified as depressed require psychosocial support. There is considerable interest in the role of counselling for depression. Many patients find the opportunity to talk about their concerns and fears to be helpful and may find this opportunity from their clinical nurse specialist, doctor, paramedical staff and clergy. A recent study suggested that although counselling can be considered appropriate treatment in some cases (10), antidepressants have a faster onset of action and more appropriate for patients with a short life expectancy, i.e. patients with advanced cancer.",

      "title": "Psychological Aspects of Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism",
      "abstract": "Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism/Kallmann syndrome (CHH/KS) is a rare, treatable form of infertility. Like other rare disease patients, individuals with CHH/KS frequently experience feelings of isolation, shame and alienation. Unlike many rare diseases, CHH/KS is not life threatening and effective treatments are available. Nevertheless, it remains a profoundly life-altering condition with psychosocial distress on a par with untreatable or life-limiting disease. Patients with CHH/KS frequently express lasting adverse psychological, emotional, social and psychosexual effects resulting from disrupted puberty. They also frequently experience a ‘diagnostic odyssey’, characterized by distressing and convoluted medical referral pathways, lack-of-information, misinformation, and sometimes-incorrect diagnoses. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment-initiation can significantly contribute to poor body image and self-esteem. Such experiences can erode confidence and trust in medical professionals as well as undermine long-term adherence to treatment - with negative sequelae on health and wellbeing. This review provides a summary of the psychological aspects of CHH/KS and outlines an approach to comprehensive care that spans medical management as well as appropriate attention, care and referrals to peer-to-peer support and mental health services to ameliorate the psychological aspects of CHH/KS.",

      "abstract": "Although approximately 75% of menstruating women have some physical, emotional, or behavioral symptoms premenstrually,1 only 3-8% of menstruating women have extremely distressing symptoms that interfere with their lifestyle, relationships, and occupational functioning.1-3 This severe form of premenstrual symptomatology is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).4 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) (DSM-IV) defines research diagnostic criteria, which emphasize the \"on-offness\" and the severity of the symptoms. \"On-offness\" means that the symptoms should be worst in the late luteal phase and absent in the midfollicular phase. The DSM-IV also excludes confounding disorders and requires confirmation of the diagnosis after 2 months of prospective daily ratings. These strict criteria reinforce the fact that not all women who have premenstrual symptoms have a mental illness. These criteria also allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is primarily reserved for milder physical and emotional symptoms.5 These criteria allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual magnification (PMM), which occurs when symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder are magnified during the premenstruum.6",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain: multifactorial influences",
      "abstract": "Rationale Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common and complex disease whose cause is often clinically inexplicable, with diagnosis and treatment being more difficult. From a clinical viewpoint, CPP is defined as non-cyclic, non-menstrual pain lasting at least 6 months and sufficiently severe to interfere with habitual activities and requiring clinical or surgical treatment. Thus, CPP is a syndrome resulting from a complex interaction of the nervous, musculoskeletal and endocrine systems and also influenced by psychological and sociocultural factors. CPP is influenced by emotional aspects with an impact on quality of life, and involving high costs for health services. Its aetiology is not always clear and a cure or significant improvement of symptoms is not always obtained with the treatments employed, with constant frustration of the professionals involved. It can be seen that its treatment is often unsatisfactory, simply providing temporary relief of symptoms. Methods In the present study, we reviewed the bibliography regarding pelvic pain, with emphasis on emotional aspects and on the importance of a multidimensional approach to the care for these patients. Results and conclusions New investigations are needed to clarify these relations and interventions in a more effective manner. Interdisciplinary care can minimize the impact of the disease, helping the patients to cope with symptoms and improving their quality of life.",

Analysis of multiple waves of the Health and Retirement Study reveals husband’s number of chronic conditions is positively related to wife’s depressive symptoms when both spouses are chronically ill.

Type of chronic condition also matters but which type depends on the gender and health status of both spouses.

      "abstract": "Objective U.S. military special operation forces represent the most elite units of the U.S. Armed Forces. Their selection is highly competitive, and over the course of their service careers, they experience intensive operational training and combat deployment cycles. Yet, little is known about the health-care needs of this unique population. Method Professional consultations with over 50 special operation forces operators (and many spouses or girlfriends) over the past 6 years created a naturalistic, observational base of knowledge that allowed our team to identify a unique pattern of interrelated medical and behavioral health-care needs. Results We identified a consistent pattern of health-care difficulties within the special operation forces community that we and other special operation forces health-care providers have termed “Operator Syndrome.” This includes interrelated health and functional impairments including traumatic brain injury effects; endocrine dysfunction; sleep disturbance; obstructive sleep apnea; chronic joint/back pain, orthopedic problems, and headaches; substance abuse; depression and suicide; anger; worry, rumination, and stress reactivity; marital, family, and community dysfunction; problems with sexual health and intimacy; being “on guard” or hypervigilant; memory, concentration, and cognitive impairments; vestibular and vision impairments; challenges of the transition from military to civilian life; and common existential issues. Conclusions “Operator Syndrome” may be understood as the natural consequences of an extraordinarily high allostatic load; the accumulation of physiological, neural, and neuroendocrine responses resulting from the prolonged chronic stress; and physical demands of a career with the military special forces. Clinical research and comprehensive, intensive immersion programs are needed to meet the unique needs of this community.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Symptoms of grief or bereavement may be characterized by agitation, somatic complaint and social withdrawal. Other situational factors may precipitate maladjustment with depressed mood. Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

      "title": "Is musical hallucination an otological phenomenon? a review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Musical hallucination is the subjective experience of hearing music, or aspects of music, when none is being played, and as such is a disorder of the processing of complex sounds. Objective of Review: To determine the extent to which the otological system is responsible for musical hallucination, and to evaluate approaches to clinical management. Type of Review: A review of all studies and literature reviews pertaining to musical hallucination, supplemented by inclusion of informative case reports. Search Strategy: A systematic search of multiple databases carried out on 22nd March 2009 was complemented by referral to the reference lists of included manuscripts. Results: Although not always troublesome in itself, musical hallucination can be a marker of underlying pathology in the ear or brain, or indicate obsessive‐compulsive traits or social isolation, and is likely to be clinically underreported. Associations have been reported with hearing loss, female gender, social isolation and being over 60 years of age, although it is rare even in this group, and these may well not be independent risk factors. Robust comparative analysis of these factors with controls has yet to be undertaken. Underlying causes include neurovascular pathology, psychiatric disorders and opioid medications, however these are absent in the majority of cases. Conclusions: This review supports the proposal that the otological system plays a role in the pathogenesis of musical hallucination. Hearing impairment may act as an initiating factor, and the primary dysfunction is overactivity of auditory association cortex, although an impairment of higher‐level inhibition does also seem necessary. Once underlying sinister causes have been excluded, first line treatment should be explanation of the condition and optimisation of hearing. Medications have a role only in selected patient groups.",

      "abstract": "What is the evolution of hysteria, now that the spectacular crises of previous times tend to occur less frequently? Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

Given to fact that the disease is unpredictable and has uncertain outcomes, the grater are physical and emotional efforts that an individual has to take, and that inevitably causes additional exhaustion. Assessment of disease severity based only on an objective clinical finding is not enough, because it does not give insight into the subjective experience of disease symptoms and difficulties with which these patients meet in everyday life life. Most MS sufferers most likely will experience a wide range of physical, psychological and social problems. Physical disability, fatigue, motor incapacity and sexual dysfunctions that occur with the progression of the disease, most often lead to the deterioration of the quality of life in people with MS. In addition to these factors, changes in psychological status are inevitable. Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity of MS that worsens the health condition of the patient. Studies on psychiatric comorbidities and ways of coping with MS generally highlight the connection between depression and alexithymia in MS. Prevalence alexithymia in MS patients goes up to 50%, it is associated with anxiety and significantly contributes to the severity and severity of depression. When it comes to the therapy of depression in MS of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) is recommended as the first line of treatment, but also the application of pharmacotherapy i.e. administration of sertraline and escitalopram with short-term use of alprazolam, and more recently, more and more studies are investigating neuroprotective effect of antidepressants, and recommend the use of fluoxetine. Directing preventive measures to improving social activities and prevention institutionalization ie. combining medical rehabilitation, psychosocial help and social support prevent that the disease from becoming a disability leading to complete isolation. It is also necessary to direct resources to adequate treatment of depression as determining factor of quality of life, mental health and prognostic factor of the clinical picture and course of MS.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Treatments for Early Psychosis",
      "abstract": "People experiencing psychosis often have to deal with a number of problems. These problems may stem from certain symptoms. As explained in Chapter 2, these symptoms may include positive symptoms (such as hearing voices or having unusual beliefs), negative symptoms (such as being isolated, withdrawn, or slow), cognitive dysfunction (such as difficulties with attention, learning, or memory), and other types of symptoms. However, psychosocial difficulties (like problems with school, work, relationships, and recreation/leisure activities) may disrupt life as well, even though they are not necessarily thought of as symptoms. Unfortunately, these types of problems are very common for people dealing with a psychotic disorder. Treating the se difficulties in addition to the specific symptoms is necessary to begin to feel better and to live a full life. In fact, the recovery process focuses as much on resuming school, work, relationships, and leisure activities as it does on remission (see Chapter 11 on Promoting Recovery). Although medicines are extremely important in treating symptoms, especially positive symptoms (see Chapter 6 on Medicines Used to Treat Psychosis), another type of treatments, called psychosocial treatments, focus more on helping patients with these broader problems. Normal psychosocial development begins in childhood but continues throughout adolescence and early adulthood. Adolescence and early adulthood are extremely important times when most people develop social skills and build relationships. Late adolescence and early adulthood is typically a time of finishing high school, starting college, getting a first job, having a first romantic relationship, beginning to live more independently from parents, buying a car, and establishing career goals. Success in all of these domains of life requires both psychological skills and social skills. The term psychosocial brings together these two words. So, psychosocial development refers to the important developmental stage when psychological and social skills mature. Unfortunately, for people who develop a psychotic disorder, late adolescence and early adulthood is the period of time when a first episode of psychosis usually begins. Thus, psychosis that first happens in this time period often interrupts psychosocial development, leading to psychosocial problems. Psychosocial problems refer to difficulties at school, at work, in relationships, or in recreation and leisure activities.",

      "abstract": "Introduction CD is characterized by at least three features: its duration is prolonged, it does not resolve spontaneously and it is rarely completely cured. Approximately 10-15% of young people have CD. Adolescents with CD often have emotional and behavioral problems. Objectives To assess risk factors, derived psychiatric pathologies and coping strategies for a CD diagnosis in adolescence. Methods An extensive literature review was carried out on the subject in question, extracting information mainly from scientific articles, manuals and books. Results The main risk factors are those related with the CD in question, physical sequelae, the need for long-term hospital admissions or the use of drugs whose side effects include affective or behavioral symptoms; those related to the personality traits of the affected child or adolescent. In addition, as far as the family is concerned, the presence of a low level of education, lack of support or communication, as well as the presence of psychiatric disorders or serious medical conditions in parents. Among the most frequent psychiatric disorders associated with CD are affective and anxiety disorders, adaptive disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders and behavioral disorders. Whatever the CD is, it generates high levels of stress and uncertainty in the patient and family, which must be dealt together from a flexible perspective, allowing child or adolescent to adapt to the changes, reorganize and facing them with adaptive patterns of behavior. For this, it will be essential to have adequate social and family support with relational style based on communication, trust and acceptance. Conclusions In general, both adolescents with CD and their families have an adequate capacity to adapt to the repercussions and effects derived from the disease. Nevertheless, in case of possible emotional difficulties that may appear, a comprehensive and individualized approach to these adolescents and their families is necessary to provide them resources and coping strategies in different areas and contexts in which the disease debuts.The comprehensive therapeutic approach will consist of interventions at the individual and family level. Among the main objectives of these interventions are to achieve acceptance and adaptation to CD provinding adequate psychosocial support to enable them to cope with CD in the best possible way and to detect and address the emotional implications, even coexisting psychopathology.

The most common physical problems in women are vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and vaginal tightness. Erectile dysfunction is not only a frequent but also often underestimated clinical symptom in men with SSc. The incidence of erectile dysfunction in patients with SSc ranged from 12 to 81% in different studies.

Continence depends on a number of factors including cognitive function, stool volume and stool consistency, colonic transit, rectal compliance, anal sphincter function, anorectal sensation, and anorectal reflexes. Loss of continence often results from impairment in any of these factors. Initial evaluation consists of a focused history and a physical examination looking for potential reversible and/or treatable factors. First-line treatment include dietary, behavioral, and pharmacologic management approaches in community-dwelling and long-term care settings. If first-line treatments are not effective, additional evaluation with anorectal manometry and other tests may be warranted. Surgical treatments for FI may improve symptoms and more efficacy data is needed, especially among older adults. Therapeutic options using behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical approaches can lead to symptomatic improvements or cure for FI and increased quality of life for the older patient.",

      "abstract": "The Rome diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders and functional abdominal pain are used widely in research and practice. A committee consensus approach, including criticism from multinational expert reviewers, was used to revise the diagnostic criteria and update diagnosis and treatment recommendations, based on research results. The terminology was clarified and the diagnostic criteria and management recommendations were revised. A functional bowel disorder (FBD) is diagnosed by characteristic symptoms for at least 12 weeks during the preceding 12 months in the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation. The irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are distinguished by symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Unspecified FBD lacks criteria for the other FBDs. Diagnostic testing is individualized, depending on patient age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is defined as either the FAP syndrome, which requires at least six months of pain with poor relation to gut function and loss of daily activities, or unspecified FAP, which lacks criteria for the FAP syndrome. An organic cause for the pain must be excluded, but aspects of the patient’s pain behavior are of primary importance. Treatment of the FBDs relies upon confident diagnosis, explanation, and reassurance. Diet alteration, drug treatment, and psychotherapy may be beneficial, depending on the symptoms and psychological features.",

Individuals with high levels of this trait are at risk of developing several common psychiatric disorders. The concept of alexithymia has evolved considerably over the past twenty years, and this important new work responds to the need for a definitive book on the subject. The research, theory and clinical issues surrounding alexithymia are discussed in depth, examining the psychological, biological and social aspects of the construct and their related outcomes. Featuring contributions from researchers and clinicians in the field of emotion processing and regulation, chapters include methods for assessing and reducing alexithymia, and research findings from diverse fields of scientific enquiry including genetics, neuroimaging studies, emotion regulation, attachment and trauma research, and comorbidities with a number of psychiatric and medical disorders.",

However, the results of studies on complaints of sleep disorders depending on the climacteric phase are ambiguous, which may be due to ethnicity. Data on some pathogenetic mechanisms of the formation of the most frequent sleep disorders in menopausal women - insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and fibromyalgia - are described. The results of polysomnography in these pathological states are presented, indicating a decrease in sleep efficiency, a change in its \"architecture\", and a longer waking time during the night with insomnia; a significant increase in the apnea/hypopnea index, a delay in the phase of fast sleep, a decrease in the duration of deep stages of sleep and a decrease in its effectiveness - in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The social and medical consequences of sleep disorders and their comorbidity with such pathological conditions as mental disorders, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, oncology, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, bronchial asthma, mortality are noted.",

Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

They include comorbid physical illnesses, social isolation, sensory deficits, cognitive changes, polypharmacy, and substance abuse. Agitation and aggressiveness are also associated with psychosis in the elderly and frequently are the precipitating reasons for psychiatric consultation. A review of psychoses in the elderly must, therefore, consider psychotic symptoms within the context of the underlying etiologies of the psychotic symptoms. Elderly patients who present with psychotic symptoms require social, behavioral, and environmental interventions that are necessary for their safety and orientation. Given the likelihood of comorbid medical disorders and concomitant medications, the mere presence of delusions or hallucinations is not always an indication for additional medications. However, some patients may need pharmacologic intervention in order to manage the behavioral disturbance that often results from the psychotic symptoms. The atypical antipsychotics with their low propensity to produce extrapyramidal and cognitive side effects have greatly advanced the pharmacotherapy for elderly patients with psychoses.",

The psychological need to have a physical complaint is the psychiatric disorder for this group of patients. At the other end of this physical–psychiatric continuum are patients, without obvious physical discomfort to suggest a medical condition, who may be misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder because their presentation is atypical, or their complaints are primarily in the domain of how they feel or how they think. Physicians' understanding of the role of culture and cultural biases toward mental illness and of the physical components of mood and anxiety disorders results in a consideration of a psychiatric diagnosis. This process occurs even in the absence of the patient's complaint of psychological symptoms. Instances in which patients' physical complaints are parts of mood and anxiety disorders may cause diagnostic confusion for physicians who consider only medical diagnoses.

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

The core feature of these disorders is a level of anxiety and fears that is not appropriate for that stage of development in a child which leads to anxiety disorders having a significant impact on disrupting daily activities of a child. It is important to monitor children’s fears within the context of their development. Estimations show that approximately 10 to 20% of all children develop some kind of anxiety disorders. They are present with the children of both sexes, although some anxiety disorders have shown to be featured more often in girls. Anxiety disorders can be diagnosed after the age of six. Early discovery and proper treatment can significantly help with the possible negative effects these disorders have on social and family life as well as on a child’s performance in school. Anxiety disorders are comorbid conditions with other psychiatric disorders. Anxiety is manifested in the form of bodily, psychological, cognitive and behavioural changes. When it comes to etiology, a variety of factors are present, with the causes of anxiety disorders still not fully known, but both psychiatric and general medical factors are involved. Clinical studies, as well as every day practice, have shown that most effective results yield when cognitive- behavioural therapy (CBT) combined with prescription medication is utilized. Cognitive therapy bases its approach on identifying and replacing negative thinking patterns and behaviours with positive ones while behavioural techniques aim to change behavioural patterns in children with anxiety disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first choice when it comes to medication therapy as they are proven time and time again to be the most effective in anxiety disorders. When diagnosed early and using a proper treatment, anxiety disorders can be reduced to a minimum as to not cause any damage to the child’s life. It is crucial in children and adolescents psychiatry for the success of the treatment for parents or guardians to be heavily involved in all stages of treating the disorder, from planning to practicing techniques proposed by the physician.",

After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

Depression, the most common mental disorder in later life, is a major precipitating factor in suicide. Alcoholism is another major precipitating factor in late-life suicide. Approximately one-third of all suicides are alcoholics. Many of the same factors which contribute to depression also increase the risk of alcoholism and/or suicide. Loss, stress, loneliness, low self-esteem, and feelings of anxiety, rejection, helplessness, and hopelessness characterize late life alcoholism and depression. Alcoholism, depression, and suicide form a deadly triangle. Family, caregivers, and practitioners need to be aware of the deadly relationship between alcoholism, depression, and suicide in older adults.",

DSD conditions are often discovered during early adolescence, an age well known to predispose to high risk for adjustment problems. Presentation may be with lack of or minimal pubertal development, lack of menarche, vaginal, uterine, or breast agenesis and inappropriate sexual development such as virilization in females or feminization (gynecomastia) in males. Most such disorders require life‐long therapy, with many of the medical, surgical and psychological aspects of management being accentuated during adolescence. Regardless of the age at presentation, all require skillful management to promote normal health and well‐being. This care ideally involves specialists in endocrinology and medical therapy, psychology and, if required, surgery. A brief discussion of the needs of the adolescent with DSDs is presented.",

While more than a quarter of the American population has suffered from mental illness in the past 12 months, their families undergo an extraneous emotional and financial burden. Clinicians and researchers follow the definitions and diagnostic guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. According to the DSM, mental disorders are behaviours or psychological syndromes which cause significant distress or interfere with a person’s ability to function during their everyday life. Yet, this diagnostic tool falls short.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) affetcs a group of root nerves called Cauda equina\r\n (lat. Pony tail). These nerves are located at the lower end of the spine in the lumbosacral part\r\n of the body. They send and also receive messages for pelvis, legs and feet. Trauma, excessive\r\n strains, violent injuries and some deseases and conditions ( hernation of the disc) can result\r\n with compression of the root of this nerve. There is severe pain in the lower part of the back,\r\n loss or change of sensation in the legs, buttocks and can also result with difficulty in\r\n urinating. Surgical treatment must be performed quickly to prevent permanent damage such\r\n as leg paralysis, bladder and bowel dysfuncion, sexual function or other problems.\r\n This syndrome has a significant effect on people – physically and emotionally, especially if it\r\n is chronic. Often, people with CES may no longer go to work because of the severe problems\r\n with pain, social problems, weaknes in motor and sensor skills that can be fully or partialy\r\n lost. Loss of bladder and bowel control can be extremly disturbing and has a very negative\r\n impact on social life, work and relationships. Nurse interventions should be geared towards\r\n providing supportive, emotional support with education about the syndrome and how to\r\n improve the quality of life, reduce pain; also in interventions they should oberve such patients\r\n and assist with the implementation of the activities.\r\n CES occurs more often in adults then in children. Men are more likely to be ill from this\r\n syndrome than women. Middle age is also a significant risk factor as this age population is\r\n more likely to develop problems with herniated disc.",

      "abstract": "Thoughts, feelings, and moods can have a significant effect on the onset of some diseases, the course of many, and the management of nearly all.Many visits to the doctor are occasioned by psychosocial distress. Even in those patients with organic medical disorders, functional health status is strongly influenced by mood, coping skills, and social support, yet the predominant approach in medicine is to treat people with physical and chemical treatments that neglect the mental, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of illness. This critical mismatch between the psychosocial health needs of people and the usual medical response leads to frustration, ineffectiveness, and wasted health care resources. There is emerging evidence that empowering patients and addressing their psychosocial needs can be health and cost effective. By helping patients manage not just their disease but also common underlying needs for psychosocial support, coping skills, and sense of control, health outcomes can be significantly improved in a cost-effective manner. Rather than targeting specific diseases or behavioral risk factors, these psychosocial interventions may operate by influencing underlying, shared determinants of health such as attitudes, beliefs, and moods that predispose toward health in general. Although the health care system cannot be expected to address all the psychosocial needs of people, clinical interventions can be brought into alignment with the emerging evidence on shared psychosocial determinants of health by providing services that address psychosocial needs and improve adaptation to illness.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

The problem ofprevention and treatment ofdentoalveolar anomalies has not only medical, but also a social value. Many patients understand the needfor timely treatment to the dentist. Beautiful and straight teeth have become part of modern life, his well-being, health and social status. Any abnormalities always affect the psyche. Patients with dental system pathology suffer from changes in appearance, violations of phonetics, chewing function and this formed the difficulties in communication. Mental and emotional state plays an important role in human life, which affects the predictions of success and the development of treatments. Do not unimportant role in the treatment plays a dentist, his mood affects the man, and he has concluded on the basis of suggestion or self-hypnosis.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling; psychiatric disorder that affects around 1% of the population and its point prevalence is 0.6 to 8.3 cases per 1000 population. 1,2Caregiving in psychiatric illness is an exhausting and challenging activity that typically involves a considerable amount of energy, time and money over considerably long periods of time, in tasks that may be unpleasant or uncomfortable and could be psychologically and physically stressful and tiring.3\r\nCaregiving to mentally unstable people can be particularly challenging in traditional societies such as India. The close - knit family structure and lack of adequate government resources to support people with mental illness place the burden of care on the family which is perceived to be the ‘‘natural’’ caregiver. Socio-cultural expectations envision caregiving as an obligation and moral binding which is to be given by parents, children or the spouse. Religious-cultural attributions often causally implicate supernatural factors in the manifestation of mental illness.\r\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that usually starts in late adolescence or early adulthood, and is characterized by profound disruption in thinking, language, perception and the sense of self, and includes psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions. 6\r\nThe volatile nature of the disorder and its accompanying debilitating consequences burdens the family in multiple domains causing social, emotional and financial problems. Several studies had done worldwide reveal a high level of burden, social isolation and stigma among caregivers of schizophrenia. Indian data in this area is relatively sparse however some studies reports the presence of depression, anxiety, poor mental and physical health and other mental disorders among the caregivers. In view of the above the present study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of life and marital adjustment in spouses of schizophrenia patients.",

      "abstract": "The reporting of physical symptoms is influenced to a large degree by psychological processes. Individuals are more likely to notice subtle sensations in environments lacking in stimulation than those demanding external attention. The beliefs or schemas that people hold dictate where and how they attend to their bodies as well. These normal perceptual processes help explain why people are often poor at accurately detecting internal physiological activity. Several individual differences are also related to the symptom reporting process. Females are more likely to base their symptom reports on external situational cues than are males. In addition, individuals with chronic anxiety--those high in Negative Affectivity (NA)--report more symptoms than those low in NA. Finally, individuals, who have had traumatic experiences, either in childhood or within 1-6 months prior to a major symptom reporting episode, tend to be high symptom reporters. Several recommendations are made to help researchers and clinicians distinguish between psychological or perceptual factors with presumed biological effects. One implication of this work is that MCS and allied syndromes should be viewed as both a mental and a physical health problem.",

      "abstract": "Every illness represents in some way a threat and increases the sense of vulnerability. The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

Excessive stress from a single-event and/or cumulative life experiences during childhood, such as those documented in the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study, is translated into neurobiological toxicity that alters the set-point of the HPA axis and limbic system homeostasis [suggested new term: regulation pathway (RegP)]. The resultant alteration of the RegP not only increases the risk for psychiatric and physical illness, but also that for early onset and chronic addictions by dysregulating the RewP. This paper reviews the interface of these symbiotic pathways that result in the phenotypic pathology of emotional dysregulation, cognitive impairment, and compulsive behaviors, as well as morbidity and shorter life expectancy when dysregulated by chronic stress.",

      "abstract": "With aging, there are changes in both libido and erectile function. Although the majority of aged men remain interested in sex, less than 15% report continued sexual intercourse. The cause of this \"libido-potency gap\" is due primarily to erectile failure. Penile erection is dependent upon a complex interaction of the autonomic nervous system, cardiovascular system, and local neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Sexual stimulation causes augmented blood flow into the corpora cavernosa, and restricted outflow, resulting in penile rigidity. With aging, there is a decline in gonadal steroids, nerve conduction velocity, and vascular compliance, any of which could interfere with normal erections. When disease is superimposed on the normal changes of aging, erectile function is further impaired. Evaluation of an elderly male with impotence may consist of a detailed drug history and trial of alternate therapy, as in the case of adverse drug reactions. More often, evaluation entails hormonal assays, penile vascular assessment, neurologic assessment, and an evaluation of nocturnal erectile function. Based on the results of these assessments, appropriate treatment alternatives can be chosen. With the availability of multiple treatment options, patients and physicians can now choose from a range of noninvasive or invasive alternatives depending upon the etiology, associated disorders, and preference of the patient.",

La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress.

      "abstract": "There is increased risk caused by social difficulties and/or childhood trauma for developing both general medical and mental health conditions, with overlap in similarity of magnitude of some increased risks, although intermediary mechanisms may differ. Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "title": "Premature ejaculation – how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Premature ejaculation (PE) corresponds to “a persistent or recurring ejaculation pattern that occurs during sexual activity with a partner approximately 1 minute after vaginal penetration and before the person wishes to”. It affects 5–20% of men, having its origin in psychological factors and with important biological contribution. It is considered generalised, when not confined to certain patterns of stimulation, situations, or partners, or may be situational. It may occur soon after the onset of sexual activity (primary) or after a normal sexual functioning (acquired). Primary EP is associated with the hyposensitivity 5-HT2C receptors and/or hypersensitivity 5-HT1A receptors. High performance anxiety levels are related to acquired EP. Increasing this physiological knowledge has enabled significant advances in treatment. Objective Approach the therapeutic options of EP and its peculiarities. Methods Literature review of articles published in the last five years, using the PubMed and Scielo databases. Results At present, the approaches include psychosexual counseling, behavioral and pharmacotherapy. Among the most popular drugs, antidepressants stand out, particularly dapoxetine, the first medication specifically approved. Local anesthetics, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and tramadol are also used. Acupuncture is suggested as a useful therapeutic, but needs more research. Conclusion The behavioral therapies are referred to as first-line treatment in the long-term, associated or not with medication. Dapoxetine is the preferred symptomatic treatment. However, a holistic approach, including psychotherapy and sex therapy, is the most beneficial modality for sexual and marital relationship.

Patients with this disorder have always been present in medical settings, but have been described as \"difficult patients\" rather than patients with borderline personality disorder.

Suggestive medical syndromes and diagnoses in the medical setting may include alcohol and substance misuse (including the abuse of prescription medications), multiple somatic complaints, chronic pain, obesity, sexual impulsivity, and hair pulling.

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Clinical experience has appeared to support the view that persons with repeated episodes of schizophrenia can expect to have a chronic course with residual symptoms and lasting deficits in such areas as work, social relations, and self-care. However, the authors' review of recent long-term follow-up studies and of the clinical experiences of early researchers strongly challenges this pervasive expectation. This report suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity in the long-term outcome of schizophrenia, with marginal or deteriorated states more the exception than the rule. Among the contributors to the misperception of chronicity are biased sampling, both past and present, as well as a multitude of environmental and psychosocial factors that affect patient outcome.",

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much. Pointing out the role of the dentist in approaching patients with physical and psychical disabilities, motivating and making them aware of the necessity of adopting a proper oral hygiene for preventing oral disorders. The dramatic impact on the psyche and the well-chosen words stressed by the clinician increase patient awareness and motivation in order to make him collaborate during the treatment.",

Disinterest or ignorance from the part of a physician is also noticed with respect to the psychosexual complaints of patients. Sexual dysfunction can arise as a result of biological problems, relationship problems, intrapsychic conflicts, lack of proper sexual knowledge, medical disorders, and use of medicines such as antihypertensive and antidepressants. Chronic and persistent alcohol dependence is also a well- known cause of sexual dysfunction, which can cause marked distress and interpersonal difficulty leading to worsening of alcohol abuse. Sexual dysfunctions in alcohol dependence can be because of the depressant effect of alcohol, alcohol- related disease, or a multitude of psychological factors related to alcohol use. The Indian population currently passing through the rapid changing phase of substance dependence is manifesting increased psychosexual dysfunction which, in turn, might contribute to the causation of mental illnesses, including mood disorders, among the vulnerable. There are only limited studies from India regarding the psychosexual dysfunction among alcohol- dependent individuals. Alcohol dependence has very high prevalence among Indian population, but the psychosexual problems among the population often remain unattended. The study stresses the need of specialists to look for sexual problems in their clients.",

      "abstract": "Although the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be found in many “normal” people, these symptoms are present to a greater extent in those affected by the disorder. In these patients, ADHD symptoms cause substantial functional impairment. Therefore, the goal of treatment is not simply to reduce core symptoms, but also to decrease the level of impairment caused by these symptoms. Common impairments in adolescents and adults include academic and occupational problems that are particularly evident in the context of tasks requiring a high degree of organization or attentional function. These impairments result in problems related to task completion, prioritizing work and other obligations, and time management, etc. These symptoms often impact successful completion of tasks in school or at work, and can also result in a variety of problems in initiating and managing relationships (Slide 1). Mood and anxiety disorders often co-occur with ADHD in adults. The accumulation of experiences related to impaired academic and/or occupational performance, and or persistent relationship problems, due to the symptoms of ADHD, can lead to either depressed mood or anxiety related to performance and/or social situations. Therefore, in treating adults with ADHD, reduction of those co-occurring symptom presentations is also an important goal.",

More recently, animals have been incorporated into a number of “animal-assisted interventions”, including animal-assisted activities, animal assisted-therapy, and service animal programs. The most common forms of animal-assisted interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions involve dogs or horses, often described as canine or equine therapy (or hippotherapy), respectively.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder; GAD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) are common mental health conditions associated with disability, decreased quality of life, increased mortality, and economic burden.– PTSD is a persistent mental health condition that may occur in individuals who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, such as exposure to death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence. GAD, which is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 40 Canadians aged 15 years and older per year, is characterized by persistent and excessive fear, worry, and feelings of being overwhelmed. Finally, symptoms of MDD (also known as clinical depression or major depression) include sadness, insomnia, loss of interest in hobbies, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. A formal diagnosis of MDD requires the persistence of symptoms over a period of at least two weeks. Treatment strategies for PTSD, GAD, and MDD often include clinical care with pharmacologic agents (e.g., antidepressants), psychotherapy, or a combination of both approaches.The objective of the current report is to summarize and appraise the available evidence on the clinical effectiveness of canine therapy and equine therapy versus other forms of psychotherapy for the treatment of individuals with PTSD, GAD, MDD. This report compliments a 2012 CADTH Rapid Response Report on the use of therapy dogs and horses for patients with mental health conditions.",

      "title": "SP0208 UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF PAIN, SLEEP AND FATIGUE ON PATIENTS LIVES",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Pain is well known to be a common dominant symptom in people with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Perhaps less well acknowledged by healthcare professionals are fatigue and sleep disturbances in these patients. Individually these symptoms are problematic but when combined their effect and impact on patients' lives is greatly amplified; often leaving people in a vicious cycle whereby being in pain results in poor sleep leading to fatigue the next day, which lowers patients' pain tolerance resulting in a poorer night\"s sleep, more fatigue and increased pain. Pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance greatly reduce quality of life for people with RMDs. Patients have to adapt their daily and leisure activities, or give them up altogether with negative psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression. Patients can end up feeling helpless and sometimes suicidal. Relationships with partners and friends are often altered affecting their sexual and social lives. Major life decisions, such as having a baby, can be put on hold or shelved. People with RMDs may also have to reduce their working hours or stop working, which has financial repercussions for them and their families. This can exacerbate stress, anxiety and depression leading to poorer health outcomes. It is therefore of great importance that healthcare professionals understand the extent to which pain, fatigue and sleep difficulties impact on patients' lives so that priority can be given to addressing these distressing symptoms as part of any management strategy. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

This failure occurred on the basis of chronic stress caused usually by relevant psychosocial stimulus, with clinical manifestation mainly in cardiovascular or immune systems followed with serious threaten of health and life. A lost of independence, loneliness, change of dwelling-place and living standard, low income, stages of confusion, mental disease, passive life attitude belong to psychosocial risks of the origin of geriatric maladaptation syndrome. Higher age and bad health status belong to biological risks of the origin of geriatric maladaptation syndrome. Clinical image of geriatric maladaptation syndrome has three phases (1. development of stress reaction, 2. full clinical image development of adaptation failure, 3. followed phase of adaptation reaction). It is a set of somatic disorders, which threaten a life of old people. These disorders arose in a consequence of inadequate adaptation to stress life event. Geriatric maladaptation syndrome is significantly different from mentioned adaptation disorders because of its clinical course and frequently unfavourable prognosis.

This modality shows strong limits namely in the case of sudden and unexpected violent behaviours, of adhesion to terrorist groups or to criminal regimes, of somatic pathologies, of deficiencies in the development of functions. Utilising psychoanalytic, or psychoanalytically inspired literature, history documents, and clinical examples, a different assessment modality is proposed, both of pathological conditions and of the outcome of treatment: classification of levels of health is based on the degree of connection between different systems of the organism, which are also strongly related to the development of functions, such as dreaming, reflective capacity or affect regulation. Psychic, but also somatic symptoms often appear in this view not as the essence of pathology but as useful alarm signals and forms of communication; at any rate, they should be considered in conjunction with the proposed dimension.",

Jeder Kraftfahrer hat sich vor der Inbetriebnahme eines Fahrzeuges stets zu vergewissern, dass er nach seinen koerperlichen und geistigen Faehigkeiten dazu (noch) imstande ist, den Anforderungen des Strassenverkehrs zu genuegen. Wirkungen oder Nebenwirkungen von Medikamenten koennen eine Reihe von physischen oder psychischen Stoerungen verursachen, welche die Verkehrstauglichkeit herabsetzen. Als verkehrsmedizinisch relevant muessen alle Pharmaka gelten, die einen zentralen Angriffspunkt haben. Die Wirkungen der in Betracht kommenden Medikamente haengen jedoch von verschiedensten Faktoren und der individuellen Situation des Betroffenen ab. Prinzipiell ist zu sagen, dass eine medikamentenbedingte Fahruntuechtigkeit ein normatives Tatbestandsmerkmal ist, dem ein vorsaetzliches oder fahrlaessiges Verhalten zugrunde liegen kann. Die rechtliche Entscheidung ueber die Verschuldensfrage und die Schuldform haengt davon ab, ob und gegebenenfalls wie der betroffene Lenker vor oder waehrend der Fahrt die Wirkung der konsumierten Medikamente im Hinblick auf seine Fahrsicherheit beurteilt hat und beurteilen musste. Da jeder Fahrzeuglenker vor Antritt der Fahrt verpflichtet ist, seine Fahrtuechtigkeit zu pruefen, handelt er im Falle einer mangelnden eigenen Vorsorge fahrlaessig. Auf die verschiedenen Moeglichkeiten eines Kraftfahrers, eine Fahruntuechtigkeit vorauszusehen, wird eingegangen. Ein Kraftfahrer, der sich gegen aerztlichen Rat nach Einnahme eines Medikamentes ans Steuer setzt, handelt schuldhaft.

Such negative thoughts can be recognized by probing into the patient’s mental attitude. Similar is the adverse effect when the patient feels a lack of genuine love and understanding in one’s social circle. Not recognising the presence of negativity in a patient’s psycho-spiritual history can lead to inappropriate or ineffective treatment. Inclusion of psycho-spiritual history in clinical medicine leads to opening up of a hidden aspect of the patient’s problem, which when tackled has significant therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness is a common complaint among patients presenting to family physicians. Diagnosis begins with a patient history distinguishing weakness from fatigue or asthenia, separate conditions with different etiologies that can coexist with, or be confused for, weakness. The pattern and severity of weakness, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history help the physician determine whether the cause of a patient's weakness is infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced. In the physical examination, the physician should objectively document the patient's loss of strength, conduct a neurologic survey, and search for patterns of weakness and extramuscular involvement. If a specific cause of weakness is suspected, the appropriate laboratory or radiologic studies should be performed. Otherwise, electromyography is indicated to confirm the presence of a myopathy or to evaluate for a neuropathy or a disease of the neuromuscular junction. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the examiner should pursue a tiered progression of laboratory studies. Physicians should begin with blood chemistries and a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to evaluate for electrolyte and endocrine causes, then progress to creatine kinase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibody assays to evaluate for rheumatologic, inflammatory, genetic, and metabolic causes. Finally, many myopathies require a biopsy for diagnosis. Pathologic evaluation of the muscle tissue specimen focuses on histologic, histochemical, electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic analyses; advances in technique have made a definitive diagnosis possible for many myopathies.",

      "abstract": "Deviations from emotional and physiological homeostasis in humans occur under episodic, chronic, or traumatic stress experiences. These dysregulations can provoke emotional and physical disturbances that may result in stress-related psychiatric or psychosomatic disorders. This brief review discusses a variety of both naturally occurring and experimental stressors and the complexity of intervening variables on cardiovascular and hormonal dysregulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In addition to the type, intensity, and duration of the stressor, subject variables such as dispositional factors (e.g., age and sex), personality traits, and coping styles are considered. Finally, emotional and physiological stress responses to naturally occurring stressors and psychological challenge tests in depressed patients and anxiety disorder patients are presented and discussed. Stressors in humans induce emotional arousal, which leads to physiological activation of the central nervous system, an increase of hormones of the HPA axis, and coping reactions on the psychological and behavioral level. Depending on the type, intensity, and duration of the stressor, on personal and psychosocial resources of the individual, stressful situations may provoke emotional and physical disturbances. These dysfunctions may result in psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders. The following brief review intends to discuss a variety of stressors that have been examined in humans in order to gain insight into the complex relationship between physiological and behavioral stress reactions and the occurrence or maintenance of stress related psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders.",

Negative symptoms are semi-independent of positive symptoms. They are variable early in the illness but accrue in severity, stability, and prognostic weight with time. The nature of the processes that generate negative symptoms and their specificity to schizophrenia remain to be elucidated.

      "abstract": "Mrs. S, age 50, has had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for approximately 10 years. She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., text revision criteria for autism spectrum disorder require deficits in three areas of communication and social interaction across multiple settings, with at least two restricted or repetitive behaviors, not explained by another condition, and causing functional impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for autism at ages 18 and 24 months in addition to routine developmental surveillance, whereas screening in adults is not recommended. Diagnosis should include a multidisciplinary team and a multidimensional assessment. Autistic individuals have a 20- to 30-year lower life expectancy than nonautistic people and experience higher rates of many chronic conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, gastrointestinal concerns, feeding disorders, and mental health disorders (eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia). Treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder focuses on minimizing core deficits, maximizing functional independence, and preventing problem behaviors. Pharmacologic therapy may be indicated for related conditions or symptoms, such as sleep disorders, seizures, mental health conditions, behavior problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Melatonin effectively reduces sleep symptoms and improves daytime behaviors with minimal adverse effects. The SPACE (sensory, predictability, acceptance, communication, empathy) framework provides specific interventions that make health care more accessible and affirming to autistic patients.",

      "title": "Functional and Psychosocial Consequences of Major Depressive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Depression is associated with profound personal and societal costs worldwide, in great part due to negative functional and psychosocial consequences. These consequences can range from minimally disruptive to life-altering, and they occur across a wide variety of life domains (e.g. home, work, school, social). Despite patient preference for the inclusion of functional outcomes as the desired endpoint of antidepressant treatment and goal for the achievement of wellness, functional outcomes are still infrequently measured. This is likely due, at least in part, to the wide variety of assessment tools that are available and lack of consensus definitions of functional recovery. This chapter reviews several measures that are available to assess functioning; describes the functional impairment associated with depression and related symptoms, such as cognition, sleep, and pain; and briefly discusses issues associated with treating disrupted functioning in depression. Future directions include the need to develop and utilize a consensus definition of functional recovery, as well as consistent incorporation of functional assessment in both clinical monitoring and research outcomes.",

Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living.

      "title": "Psychological Management of Multiple Sclerosis An Overview",
      "abstract": "Eight case histories demonstrate features of the predisposing childhood background met with in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) together with the passive dependent coping mechanisms adopted by the child to ensure short-term survival, but which perpetuated into adult life are inadequate and somatically damaging. First, there is pathological dependence on a parental key figure later transferred wholly or partly to other key figures. The pathological dependence leads to ambivalence over separation from the key figure(s) and the attainment of an independent emotional existence. The childhood of MS patients is overwhelming because it is either turbulent or excessively cloying, and the child's response passive and docile. Other siblings, for reasons such as position in the sibship, or their sex, or inherited toughness, escape the full rigour of parental dominance, or successfully rebel against it. MS subjects are thus especially vulnerable to threats of illness, death or irretrievable severance from key figures but, while detachment is perilous, they also fear and resent engulfment and the loss of any small measure of identity they may have gained. With their infantile attempts at separation at age of 2–3 frustrated, or too feeble for success, and having learned the 'giving-up' response as their only defence against what they see as hopeless odds, it is hardly surprising that bids for independence at adolescence are equally unsuccessful. They often recall a few attempts at adolescent rebellion painfully and quickly put down by the threat of withdrawal by the key figure. Often these adolescent or adult attempts at independence are associated with sexual relationships bedevilled by guilt from early libidinous fantasies, and fears of being trapped into parenthood and responsibility thereby threatening their own position as the dependent child. It is, therefore, no accident that the onset and relapses of MS are commonly associated with the crises courtship, marriage and birth. The women, if they are childless, which is often the case because of their own hang-ups, not infrequently fantasise their sisters' or friends' babies as their own. Because of their superficial affability, men and women are vulnerable to the trauma of being made unwilling confidants especially in the sexual misdemeanours of their neighbours, friends, parents, siblings, children and grandchildren, and identify closely with injured parties; such experiences are frequently provocative of onset nd relapse of MS. MS patients conceal emotions, particularly aggressive emotions, behind a mask. The mask they wear is either smiling, or 1 Based on a paper read to the Society for Psychosomatic Research, London 1976. Paulley 27 unsmiling and flat. The flat mask may incorrectly be interpreted as depression. The moria seen with the brain damage of GPI parallels the gross euphoria of advanced cases of MS, but both are caricatures of the basic mood antedating the disease. Relatives and friends as well as the patient will confirm that the smiling or unsmiling mask is premorbid and an early learned defence to conceal real feelings too dangerous to reveal. In this series there is a predominance of eldest and youngest children, and the histories reveal that they are often the most exposed to the damaging factors mentioned. However, the figures are just below the level of statistical significance. Likewise, the number of only children seemed to be more than one would expect. Psychotherapy is directed to helping these patients in the therapeutic situation to show their feelings, sometimes for the first time in their lives, and bring into consciousness their unconscious habit of hiding more intense feelings behind a smiling or unsmiling mask, and then to learn to lower their defensive mask, not only in the therapeutic situation, but later in their interpersonal relationships. Of necessity this programme also involves helping the patient wherever possible to separate emotionally from his key figure and surrogates. Experience has shown that this is more effectively and rapidly achieved by couple therapy in which the spouse or fiancé(e) affords an empathetic extension of the therapeutic situation beyond the consulting room. It is necessary to maintain therapy over the dangerous period during which dependence becomes attenuated first by substitution of the therapist for the key figure and later by incorporation of the 'good parent' and extrusion of the 'bad'. Subsequently, the link with the therapist may be weakened by spaced interviews but with easy access to the therapist in the event of relapse. Successful psychotherapy is punctuated by substantial remissions of the somatic symptoms of MS. Period of study 1946–1976, number of patients 300+, case notes traced and examined 227 (males 88, females 139).

      "title": "Neurobiological outcomes in the offspring of postnatally depressed mothers: Causes and consequences",
      "abstract": "Postnatal depression (PND) is the most common psychological disorder to affect women in the postpartum period, with an estimated prevalence of 13% in high-income countries (Gavin et al. 2005; O’Hara and Swain 1996). In low and middle income countries, the available evidence suggests that rates of PND may be substantially higher, with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 57% (Wachs et al. 2009). In terms of clinical presentation, depression occurring in the postnatal period appears to be indistinguishable from depression occurring at other times (Cooper et al., 2007), with persistent low mood and/or a profound loss of interest and enjoyment being defining characteristics. Other symptoms are mood-related disturbances in sleep, altered appetite, concentration impairment, retardation, agitation, feelings of guilt and hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or impulses. The duration of episodes varies, but the majority of postpartum depressive episodes resolve spontaneously within 6 months to a year (Cooper and Murray 1995; Cox et al. 1993). Although PND may not be unique in terms of the symptom profile, the fact that this disorder occurs in the postpartum period is a particular concern. Specifically, PND affects the mother–infant dyad at a time when the infant is particularly reliant on his or her caregiver to meet their physical, social, and cognitive needs. The postpartum period is also a time when the family unit as a whole is likely to experience additional stress, and is therefore particularly vulnerable. Given these considerations, and the relatively high prevalence of PND, the potential for adverse impact is significant. One area of research focus, reviewed here, has examined the possibility the disturbances in the mother–child relationship occurring in the context of maternal PND result in fundamental alterations in key psychobiological systems in the infant, with persistent consequences. Notably, as PND typically resolves within the first year postpartum, and therefore is particularly relevant to early development, observations deriving from the study of PND in this area offer potentially broad insights into the relevance of early environmental factors to child neurobiological functioning. Given that depressive disorder is characterized by profound impairments in mood, energy levels, motivation, and feelings of self-worth, and has established detrimental effects on interpersonal functioning, it is perhaps unsurprising that mothers with PND have been found to show disturbances in the quality of care that they provide for their infant (for a review, see Murray et al. 2010a).",

Sustained research efforts have led to a better understanding of the classification, aetiology, presentation, and treatment of OCD. Further, the clinical heterogeneity of OCD has led to efforts to identify meaningful subtypes of the disorder, based on age of onset, the presence of comorbid tics, or the focus of OCD symptoms. There is substantial support for a multi-dimensional model of OCD where symptoms are conceptualized as multiple overlapping dimensions, consisting of symmetry/ordering, contamination/cleaning, harm/aggression, or sexual/religious symptoms. Evidence suggests that these dimensions may have differential associations with a range of genetic, neural, and clinical factors. The multi-dimensional approach to OCD is thus a promising future direction for OCD research.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Headache associated with sexual activity (HSA) is the painful event of head and neck precipitated only by sexual activity. The negative impact of sexuality is expected to be more severe in HSA patients and their partners than other headache disorder. In addition, social and cultural taboo may conceal sexual problem or hinder seeking counseling for sexual perplexity. A sufficient scientific evidence is therefore needed to clarify the misunderstanding and schedule appropriate education in clinical practice. Methods: A systematic review of literature was completed to elucidate the sexual behavior, function and satisfaction in HSA patients and their partners. Results: A total of 97 publications are eligible after careful screening. However, most of the studies focus on the etiopathogenesis or treatment. Sexual change was mentioned in 23 publications. Orgasmic headache is the most frequent type of HSA. The HSA occurs more frequent in dyadic than extradyadic sexual activity. Intercourse is the leading sexual act for HSA occurrence, following by masturbation. A few patients suffer HSA under specific sexual position, like kneeling, and trigger, such as cannabis. Pain can be rapidly ceased in half of patients when sexual activity was halted. Sexual function and sexual satisfaction may decrease in HSA patient and partner but improve after pain reversal. Conclusions: A shortage of sexuality data of HSA is documented in literature but that still clarifies the extradyadic and masturbatory effect on HSA occurrence. Nevertheless, HSA disturbs sexual function and satisfaction in patients and their partners. The pathogenesis of pain includes two components, the hypersympathetic status and exertional action. Therefore, physician can schedule their education and counseling for HSA according to these findings. Further investigation for sexual function and satisfaction is warranted.",

Chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic Lyme disease are current medical examples. Fixed ideas about psychodynamic causes, like \"repressed memories of sexual abuse\", when accompanied by coercive investigative methods, lead to false \"recollections\" and therapist-induced syndromes like multiple personality disorder.

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

      "title": "Considerations in Drug Therapy of the Elderly",
      "abstract": "In the elderly, particularly the frail-old or old-old, sociogenic factors combine with the effects of primary (biologic) and secondary (pathologic) aging to produce, at times, a complex clinical picture. The elderly also face a high level of psychosocial and physical stress. In addition, the clinical presentation may be complex and difficult to diagnose, as many of the classical signs and symptoms may be absent or exacerbated. Many of the diagnostic norms may not apply to the elderly, as the concept of being well differs when comparing young with older people. Drug effects in the elderly fluctuate and are much more unpredictable. The elderly patient may present in a confusional state caused by unexplained drug effects. For varying reasons, elders suffer from unwanted drug effects more frequently than do younger adult patients. Assessment of the health status of the elderly must be based on the understanding that problems of living, general health factors, diseases of adaptation, and a decrease in the efficiency of several organ systems combine to determine that status.",

The relationship between depression and decreased libido may be blurred, but treating one condition frequently improves the other. Medications used to treat depression may decrease libido and sexual function. Frequently, patients do not volunteer problems related to sexuality, and physicians rarely ask about such problems. Asking a depressed patient about libido and sexual function and tailoring treatment to minimize adverse effects on sexual function can significantly increase treatment compliance and improve the quality of the patient's life.",

      "title": "Inquadramento diagnostico e gestione farmacologica della depressione senile Assessment and pharmacological management of elderly depression",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression is chronic and disabling and is an important factor for elderly suicide. The prevalence of depression in the elderly has attracted extensive research effort and yelded a wide range of estimates, depending on diagnostic criteria, the method of detecting depression, the experience of the interviewers and, most importantly, the characteristics of this population. Major Depression appears to be less common in the elderly than in younger adults, but subsyndromal depression is more prevalent. DSM diagnostic criteria require either depressed mood or loss of interest, but these symptoms appear to be less prominent in the elderly, being anxiety, irritability and physical symptoms more significant indicators of elderly depressive states. Depression in the elderly is essentially heterogeneous and has a multifactorial etiopathogenesis (Fig. 1): this has contributed to its underrecognition, underestimation and undertreatment. The “atypical” clinical presentation of depression in the elderly as somatic symptoms, anxiety, changes in functional ability, loss of capacity to enjoy life or loss of interest in usual activities, can be misleading for the clinician and masks an underlying mood disorder. Even “pseudodementia” is clinically important since it may result in failure to recognize and treat either depression or dementia. Comorbidity with a physical illness such as cardiovascular disease or other psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety) is frequent in late-life depression, and the presence of one or more medical illnesses may influence the diagnosis of depression; moreover, it represents a negative prognostic factor for response to antidepressant therapy. The pharmacological management of depression in late life is complicated by physiological changes associated with aging (Fig. 2), higher sensitivity to develop side-effects, concomitant medical disorders with drug-drug interaction phenomena and compliance problems. These factors need to be carefully taken into account when selecting antidepressants for the treatment of depressive states in the elderly. Antidepressants are as effective in the elderly as they are earlier in life. The development of newer antidepressants has focused on compounds that are better tolerated, with reduced unwanted effects and more likely to be used in long-term treatment. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonergic/Noradrenergic Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI), (e.g. venlafaxine) and Noradrenergic/Serotonergic Specific Antagonist (NaSSA), (e.g.mirtazapine), show a more favourable side-effects profile and appear to be more suitable for the treatment of elderly depression. In selecting the appropriate treatment, the physician should take account of concomitant illnesses and current therapies, choosing an agent with a simple once-daily regimen and a larger pharmacodynamic and therapeutic spectrum (e.g. on depressive and anxiety symptoms). However, a comprehensive management of elderly depressive states should include not only the physician, but also a psychological and psychosocial support, which appears important to explore stressors for depression and to educate patients and their families about depressive illness and its treatment.

      "abstract": "The definition, etiology, and treatments for frigidity, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea are summarized. Frigidity is an absence or lack of sexual pleasure sometimes to the extent of lack of orgasm. It can be due to fear, unresolved oedipal complex, anger, or depression. Psychotherapy is helpful, with antidepressants if appropriate. Dyspareunia is vaginal pain during sexual relations, and derives from the same types of psychological problems as frigidity. Dysmenorrhea can be related to conscious or unconscious rejection of the role of woman or mother. It is treated by psychotherapy. The sexual problems that are relieved easily by physical techniques or education are minor, while those deep in the personality and sustained by psychological mechanisms are major. Female sexual dysfunctions related to the female role are frigidity, dyspareunia, and vaginismus; those associated with the maternal role are dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, false pregnancy, vomiting in pregnancy, sterility, and sponaneous abortion.",

      "title": "Health Stresses and Depressive Symptomatology in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "The social and life sciences need to examine pathways of successful aging to master the consequences of increased longevity and physical vulnerability of the elderly population. One of older adults' well-known problems relates to the fact that their quality of life can be threatened by physical health stresses and associated depressive symptomatology. Common health problems among older adults often contribute to depressive symptomatology, and, in turn, depressive symptoms may further compromise older adults' health. It is thus an important task to discover factors that can protect older adults from experiencing the negative emotional consequences of health stresses. Using ideas from the life-span theory of control, we show how to adaptively manage the negative consequences of health problems in the elderly. Active investments in overcoming health problems that are controllable should result in positive outcomes. In contrast, it may be beneficial for older adults to disengage from health goals that are unattainable. By adjusting their control-related behaviors to the controllability of specific health stresses, older adults can maintain their psychological and physical health.",

      "title": "Awareness, Attitude and Performance of Men Regarding Premenstrual Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is thought to be a standout amongst the most widely recognized disorder among the women of reproductive age (1).It consists of a series of physical and psychological symptoms that start at the end of the premenstrual period and disappears with the onset of menstrual bleeding or the first few days after menstruation.The prevalence of PMS was estimated to be close to 80% in women of reproductive age (2).Symptoms of PMS include depression, hopelessness, emotional instability, irritability, loss of interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, loss of energy, changes in appetite or excessive desire for food, changes in sleep habits along with physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, headache, feeling bloated and edema (3).The cause of PMS remains unknown and research findings suggest that it is multi-factorial (3).Several factors such as fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone hormones, endocrine disorders and a variety of estrogen receptors, prostaglandin synthesis and environmental factors such as alcohol consumption and stress are involved in its etiology (4).Typically, PMS is a disruptive and often a debilitating factor in the lives of many women (5) in a way that it might disrupt interpersonal relations and daily activities.Moreover, in case of exacerbations, it could affect the lifestyle and well-being of the individual.Behavioral changes made in this period have a noteworthy effect on the performance of families.These effects might lead to child abuse, criminal behavior as well as incompatibility with the spouse and a decrease in the quality of marital relationships (6,7).While men do not experience the effects of premenstrual physical and emotional changes directly, premenstrual changes might affect men by changing the dynamics of relationships (6) which could result in frustration, confusion, and helplessness (8-10).Although the PMS is a serious condition, it has received scant attention so far.Due to the absence of research on the subject and considering the high prevalence of PMS among married women of reproductive age and men's insufficient awareness of the subject along with the impact of this disorder on their lives and marital satisfaction, the need for the present investigation seems evident.The purpose of this study was to determine awareness, attitude, and performance of men regarding PMS among the patients who referred to the selected health centers of Urmia in 2016.",

The prevalence of depressive mood states in survivors varies by measure and follow-up time, but the median prevalence across &gt;30 studies was 28% (mostly measured within a year of critical illness). Severe depressive states (e.g. major depressive episodes) are less common than minor depressive states. Risk factors include female sex, lesser educational attainment, unemployment, and medical and psychiatric comorbidity. Potential critical illness/intensive care-related risk factors include severity of organ failure, high-dose benzodiazepine administration, longer ICU stays, stressful ICU experiences, and early post-intensive care distress. Depressive symptoms in survivors are associated with impaired physical function, other psychiatric morbidity, cognitive and work difficulties, and lower health-related quality of life. Research is needed to evaluate the preventive or therapeutic role of psychological interventions during intensive care and psychological recovery programmes.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood and affects approximately1% of\r\nthe population. EOS begins before the age of eighteen, while VEOS begins before the age of\r\nthirteen. Since etiopathogenesis remains unclear, there are various theories about the emergence\r\nof schizophrenia: the dopamine theory, the genetic theory, the psychodynamic theory, the\r\nenvironmental theory and other. Schizophrenia is a multidimensional disease characterized by\r\nheterogeneous symptoms. The psychotic symptoms are present in children and adolescents even\r\nbefore the diagnosis of the disease. The symptoms are divided into positive, negative and\r\ndisorganisation symptoms. The expression of symptoms in children differs from those in adults\r\ndue to the cognitive variation of different ages. The delay of the cognitive development is quite\r\noften in EOS. The cognitive impairment is a basic symptom of schizophrenia and it has an\r\ninfluence on the course and recovery. DSM-V define the criteria for the diagnosis: delusions,\r\nhallucinations, disorganized speech or behaviour, and negative symptoms. The indicators of a\r\nworse outcome are: worse cognition, male sex, earlier beginning, poor economic condition, long\r\nnon-treated period, previous lower social adjustment, and negative symptoms. The most common\r\ncomorbidity is drug abuse. The conditions considered for differential diagnosis are: general\r\nmedical conditions, other psychotic disorders, pervasive developmental disorder and autism.\r\nTherapy include: antipsychotics, psychoeducation and psychotherapy. Antipsychotics are the\r\nfirst-line therapy, and the atipycal antipsychotics are the first choice. Typical (classical) and\r\natypical (newer) antipsychotics are used in therapy. It is necessary to include psychotherapy,\r\nparticularly cognitive therapy and psychoeducation.",

      "abstract": "The obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is very heterogeneous. A common characteristic is the presence of obsessions leading to anxiety or other forms of affective distress, and compulsions, which are performed to diminish the anxiety or distress. However, there is growing evidence for the role of habit forming in OCD. That questions the role of affective symptoms in OCD, such as anxiety or disgust. However affective symptoms, in particular depressive symptoms and anxiety, also occur during the course of OCD. How do affective symptoms and obsessive-compulsive symptoms relate to each other during the longterm course of OCD? These questions were investigated during provoked obessive-compulsive symptoms as well as during the six-years-course of OCD. The conclusion is that affective symptoms have an important role regarding the experience and the course of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms and that affective and obsessive-compulsive symptoms affect each other during the longterm course of OCD.",

Kaplan believes that predictors of poor outcome of sex therapy may also be substance abuse, severe depression or anxiety, and lack of motivation for treatment.In the absence of these contraindications, up to 80% of cases of sexual dysfunctions can be successfully treated using the methods of short-term behavioural therapy.

Este trastorno se caracteriza por la frecuencia y la intensidad de las fantasías sexuales, la activación psicofisiológica, el ansia y las conductas sexuales, todo ello asociado a un componente de impulsividad. Las conductas excesivas de tipo apetitivo, incluyendo la hipersexualidad, pueden considerarse como adicciones conductuales. La adicción al sexo se aplica a personas que muestran conductas parafílicas o no parafílicas relacionadas con situaciones de riesgo, con una escalada en el tipo de conductas sexuales (tolerancia), con una pérdida de control y con una consecuencias psicosociales negativas, tales como embarazos no deseados, ruptura de pareja, problemas económicos/laborales y enferme- dades de trasnmisión sexual, incluyendo el sida. Las conductas más habi- tuales implicadas en la adicción al sexo son las fantasías sexuales, la masturbación compulsiva, la pornografía, el cibersexo, el voyeurismo, el sexo anónimo y las parejas múltiples. Las conductas sexuales tienen como objetivo reducir la ansiedad y otros afectos disfóricos (por ejemplo, la ver- güenza y la depresión). La adicción al sexo presenta una comorbilidad con otros trastornos del Eje I (sobre todo, con trastornos de ansiedad, depre- sión, dependencia de sustancias e hiperactividad). Todavía hay muchas lagunas en el conocimiento del curso clínico, de los factores de riesgo y de la historia familiar y se carece de datos sobre la adición al sexo en mujeres.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders according to DSM V, like all other psychiatric disorders, are still based\r\n on the description and grouping of symptoms. The emotional state can change in two\r\n directions: an elevated mood (which can oscillate from hypomania to mania) and lower\r\n mood (depression). For diagnosing mood disorder, it is essential to have a more\r\n comprehensive diagnostic formulation. The role plays careful observation and identifying\r\n the symptoms, which are used as the most important method for diagnosing mood\r\n disorders. There must be diagnostic criteria for each disease to determine the spectrum of\r\n symptoms occurring in the disease, but it is also important that there are minimal\r\n symptoms when deciding which diagnosis will be given to the patient. In the patient\r\n besides the main mental problem, the appearance of other illnesses, such as the\r\n circumstances that have arisen in the patient's life, and in the working and social\r\n environment, must be considered. We set the mood disorder diagnosis based on anamnesis,\r\n clinical picture, and course of the disease. In basic symptoms of depression, there is a loss\r\n of interest in, until then, important things and activities. The disturbances must last at least\r\n two weeks in order to be a depressive episode. Along with the symptoms that are\r\n compulsory, there are also symptoms such as loss of energy, appetite, sense of worth and /\r\n or guilt, deconcentration, helplessness, indecision, and suicidal thoughts until attempted\r\n suicide. Patients can become so frozen that they can not show the usual emotions, such as\r\n sorrow, joy or pleasure, or they may feel that the world around them without color and life\r\n is dead. The main symptoms that characterize mania are elevated mood, increased energy\r\n and activity. These patients experience graceful ideas, they think they have tremendous\r\n power, they think they can change the whole world. One of the picture of the disease that\r\n can occur in manic patients is the appearance of interpersonal conflicts, which can lead to\r\n paranoid treatment of reality. Pharmacological and psychological therapy gives the best\r\n results, and it is important to emphasize to the patient and family that the therapy does not\r\n have immediate effect, but that the therapy should take about two to six weeks for the drug\r\n / drugs to take effect. The patient should be monitored permanently and analyzed the\r\n results achieved. If the desired results have not been reached, it is necessary to change the\r\n approach and therapy.",

Curiously enough, compared with other functional symptomatology, somehow this disturbance has been neglected in literature until now. Urologists, surgeons, and internists have more difficulties than psychiatrists to find out that distinct emotional conflicts and especially unsatisfactory sexual adjustment might have contributed to the development of recurrent or chronic urinary retention which they vainly tried to explain by organic findings. Of course the fact that extensive medical evaluations or even surgical procedures revealed no abnormality except the stout urinary bladder never is suifficient to qualify for \"hysterical disease\". Every diagnosis has to be established on positive grounds. Hypothetic explanations of mysterious syndromes by supposing more \"microscopic\" and thus undetected morphological deficiencies and changes as the crucial cause of a disease never should become the protective trick by which a physician avoids confrontation with his patients' psychological problems.",

Stress can exert various negative effects on the body ranging from alterations in homeostasis to life-threatening effects and death. Erectile dysfunction can be a manifestation of chronic stress. ED is the most common male sexual dysfunction that affects 10-25% of middle-aged and elderly men. ED may result from many etiologic factors like psychogenic, endocrino- logic, neurogenic, arteriogenic or venoocclusive dysfunction. These factors are not mutually exclusive and multi- ple factors contribute to ED in many patients. According to modern science Psychogenic factors frequently coex- ist with other etiologic factors and should be considered in all cases. A patient aged 35 years came to the OPD of A&amp;U Tibbia college with complaints of inability to initiate and maintain erection along with abnormal vision, dizziness, retrosternal burning, indigestion, heaviness in chest and disinterest. He was advised for Shirodhara along with counselling (Satvvajaychikitsa) and after a couple of days, there was a significant improvement in pa- tient. In this case study, we are trying to highlight the contribution of stress &amp; psyche on male sexual dysfunction and its management through Satvavajaychikitsa (counselling) and Shirodhara.

Whatever the origin, there is one very productive, often overlooked intervention for sexual dysfunction: exercise. Both female and male sexual dysfunction can be indicators of poor general health and may be linked to multiple conditions that respond exceptionally well to precise and tailored therapeutic exercises. Major contributing risk factors to sexual dysfunction include obesity, diabetes, hormonal imbalances, nerve damage, pharmaceutical side effects, cardiometabolic dysregulation, psychoemotional imbalance, menopause, pregnancy, and childbirth. A “go hard and rest hard” approach creates an intricate balance between high-intensity training and restorative exercise designed to address the underlying causes and risk factors of sexual dysfunction. This chapter discusses therapeutic exercise for sexual dysfunction and provides tailored exercises, detailed routines, and key practitioner-patient tools to provide a framework for a successful response to treat, reverse, and prevent sexual dysfunction.",

Despite it being the most common sex chromosomal disorder, its diagnosis is easily missed. In addition to its classical clinical features of tall stature, gynaecomastia, small testes, and symptoms and signs of hypogonadism including infertility, KS is also often associated with neurocognitive, behavioural and psychiatric disorders. We present a 44-year-old man with KS who, despite having erectile dysfunction, paradoxically had increased libido. He used sildenafil to overcome his erectile dysfunction. Hypersexuality was manifested by very frequent masturbation, multiple sexual partners most of whom were casual, and a sexual offence conviction at the age of 17 years. Discussion focuses on the frequent failure of clinicians to diagnose KS, the neurocognitive, behavioural and psychiatric aspects of KS, this unusual presentation of hypersexuality in a man with KS, and the challenges of medical management of hypogonadism in a man with a history of a sexual offence.Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is common in men (about 1 in 600 males), but the diagnosis is very often missed.In addition to classic features of hypogonadism, patients with KS can often have associated neurocognitive, behavioural and/or psychiatric disorders.More awareness of the association between KS and difficulties related to verbal skills in boys could improve rates of early diagnosis and prevent longer-term psychosocial disability.Hypersexuality in the context of hypogonadism raises the possibility of sex steroid independent mechanistic pathways for libido.Testosterone replacement therapy in KS with hypersexuality should be undertaken with caution using a multidisciplinary team approach.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a specific clinical condition that characterises unexplained disabling fatigue and a combination of non-specific accompanying symptoms for at least 6 months, in the absence of a medical diagnosis that would otherwise explain the clinical presentation. Consequences of CFS found include social isolation and stigmatization, physical inactivity, psychological disturb ances and a reduced quality of life. Plausible mechanism for the development of CFS is based on loss of immunological tolerance to the vasoactive neuropeptides following infection, significant physical exercise or de novo. Considerable evidence points towards a prominent role for central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CFS. Patients with CFS are described as perfectionist, conscientious, hardworking, somewhat neurotic and introverted individuals with high personal standards, a great desire to be socially accepted and with a history of continuously pushing themselves past their limits. Fewer than 20% of persons with CFS have been diagnosed and treated. Graded exercise therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy appeared to reduce symptoms and improve function based on evidence from RCTs.",

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Review based on scientific papers published in the last 10 years using \"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\" and \"adult\" as keywords (MeSH). Epidemiological studies have shown that 50–80% of children who have ADHD remain the same difficulties in adulthood. The underdiagnosis of ADHD in adults is due to the mitigate of hyperactivity and impulsivity with the age. However, inattention continues to affect the adult presenting these difficulties academically or at work, as low frustration tolerance, sleep disturbances and higher levels of anxiety and depression than the general population. Other studies found that 20–40% of adults with ADHD have a history of substance abuse, especially illicit drugs and tobacco. The ADHD causes significant and inadequate behavioral changes throughout life. Therefore, it is essential to a proper recognition and treatment of adults with ADHD as a good articulation between Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Adult Psychiatry, in order to improve the prognosis and quality of life.",

The gradual deterioration of function with increasing age is so widely perceived and so expected that all deterioration in function in an elderly person tends to be attributed to age. Disease in younger adults usually produces characteristic symptoms and signs by which a particular disease is recognised; if a diagnosis is not achieved on initial contact with the patient, the symptoms and signs are used as a base for further investigations and action. Functional disability due to disease attracts little medical interest, which is concentrated upon the specific features of the disease; thus the referral letter about a younger patient with suspected myocardial infarction is likely to discuss the features of the chest pain, but is unlikely to mention whether the patient can walk to the toilet or feed himself.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Numerous psychopathological syndromes have been attributed to posttraumatic stress, both at the time of the trauma and many years later. To date, however, there is little literature on pseudodementia as a delayed traumatic stress response. The authors present a case history of a 50‐year‐old woman who developed severe cognitive impairment following retrieval of previously forgotten memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her cognitive condition deteriorated rapidly and dramatically. Neuropsychological assessment and clinical presentation led to a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (vs. corticobasal degeneration). Detailed neurologic and medical evaluations could not identify any underlying physical cause. Her condition progressively worsened over 9 months, at which point memantine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist, was begun. The patient regained full functioning over the next year. Although an organic cause could not be ruled out, it was likely that recovery of traumatic memories was contributory to the patient's condition, as ongoing psychotherapy had begun 1 year into the course. If additional cases with similar presentations are reported, such cases would corroborate the notion that persistent, severe, and reversible cognitive impairment constitutes a previously unrecognized and atypical posttraumatic response.",

What are the symptoms which indicate that a hysterical case is one for the rest-treatment? When we find a case in which there is great nervous instability combined with physical weakness, and usually with absence of distinct organic disease, especially if there are present some or all of the moral defects which so commonly accompany pronounced hysterical disease, then we have a symptomcomplex calling for treatment by rest and isolation. I need not dwell on the other hysterical stigmata; the list is a long and varying one, although the more essential points are well known and fairly common: backache, headache, insomnia, constant fatigue, are signs not",

It is a state of rest for the otherwise active nervous system. It is dened as a state of unconsciousness from which a person can be aroused by appropriate sensory or any other stimulus (1). Sleep duration varies with gender, age and also according to one's daily routine.

      "abstract": "Antipsychotic agents differ in efficacy and side effects such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation because of varying mechanisms of action. A revised nomenclature for antipsychotic agents, which categorizes the drugs according to efficacy, risk of movement disorders, and risk of prolactin elevation, is described. Prolactin elevation, a potential side effect of some antipsychotic medications, is underdiagnosed but can have serious short-term and long-term consequences. Short-term problems include menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and depression. Long-term problems related to prolactin elevation include decreased bone density and osteoporosis, relapse of psychosis because of poor compliance due to sexual dysfunction or depression, and perhaps cancer, although more research in this area is needed. Despite the serious nature of these effects, prolactin elevation is seldom detected because clinicians often fail to inquire about sexual function or other symptoms that signal that a patient's prolactin may be elevated. These are problems that patients may not bring up with clinicians unless they are asked. Therefore, when patients are taking antipsychotic medications, clinicians should regularly inquire about sexual dysfunction, depression, menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and gynecomastia.",

Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

In any given year, over 25 percent of adults have one or more diagnosable mental disorders, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For the most part, psychiatric disorders are highly responsive to treatment. There have many ayurvedic plants/medicine which are effectively use for the psychiatric disorders. Ayurveda, being a stream of treatment, can no way ignore the importance of psychic condition of a patient to effectively diagnosis and treat disorders. Medical science admits that the root cause of multiple disorders lies in psychic tensions. Ayurveda too has a well developed branch of psychiatry, which has clinically proven practices of treating mental ailments and also physical problems associated with psychological imbalances. On a psychological level we naturally try to harmonies these problems but if we are not able to it can lead to a mental disorders. The causes are many but often stem from our own way of looking at things and the inability or unwillingness of our mind to process what is happening. Sometimes we just don’t want to let go of a belief or viewpoint. At other times we might be attached to a result and when something comes to challenge this, as life tends to do, we find our mind under stress in trying to work through the issue. On an unconscious level the mind may know what to do but at a conscious level the mind wants to do something else creating a conflict between the inner and outer, or the personality and the soul. The result often manifests as a Mental Disorder or sickness.",

Las manifestaciones mas propias de los adultos son problemas para concentrarse, menor capacidad de memoria y de la memoria a corto plazo, desorganizacion, dificultad en la autodisciplina, impulsividad, baja autoestima, inquietud mental, frustracion y escasas habilidades sociales. Conclusiones. En la actualidad, los adultos estan infradiagnosticados al considerarse durante mucho tiempo que el TDAH era propio de ninos y adolescentes; sus manifestaciones clinicas, aun en lo basico similares a las de los ninos, son distintas con presentaciones diferentes. No existen pruebas biomedicas que permitan un diagnostico objetivo, por lo que la historia clinica que evalue los posibles sintomas desde la infancia, los signos y sintomas tipicos y las posibles comorbilidades que han se ser resenadas, debe ser realizada meticulosamente.

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

Addiction or dependence are terms used to describe persistent psychoactive drug use, but these terms also can be applied to other forms of repetitive behaviors. Many of these repetitive behaviors are regulated by specific regions of the brain that are influenced by drugs. Consequently, drug addiction may involve effects on systems that are involved in regulating forms of addiction that are necessary for the maintenance of life. Addictions also seem to be regulated by genetic factors. Because drug addiction may influence the activities of systems that evolved to regulate behaviors necessary to survive (ie, eating and drinking) and because individuals may differ in addict-ability for a given drug caused by genetic reasons, addiction should be considered as a disease and therapy should be developed with this concept in mind.",

      "title": "Galantamine in the Treatment of Minor Depression With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Dementia in an Elderly Woman",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Depression is present in about 20%–40% of dementia patients; 15%–50% of Alzheimer's dementia patients have depression.1,2 Depression is common in the early stages of the disease and remains fairly constant through most stages of Alzheimer's dementia.3 Depression exacerbates the cognitive deficits of the preexisting dementia. In Alzheimer's dementia, mild to moderate depression may also manifest as new onset of agitation, wandering, apathy, insomnia, or change in functional status. Depressive symptoms in dementia should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable “excess disability.”4\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, an 80-year-old woman, presented with a 2-year history of cognitive decline and an 8-month history of minor depression. Depression features included low mood with decreased interest in social activities, being less energetic, psychomotor slowing, and being more withdrawn and lonely. Sleep and appetite were good. She met only 3 of the 9 features of the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Her Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)5 score was 11/30. Her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia6 score for depression in dementia was 13. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)7 score was 22/30, and she met the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's dementia. Computed tomography scan of the brain revealed generalized atrophy.\r\n\r\nMs A was started on galantamine 8 mg orally twice a day, which was subsequently increased to 16 mg orally twice a day after 4 weeks. Her minor depression features responded very well with galantamine monotherapy after 2 months. At that time, her MMSE score was 23/30, her GDS score was 4/30, and her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was 6.\r\n\r\nDepression is associated with defects of multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, catecholamine, and acetylcholine. Depression in Alzheimer's dementia is linked to catecholaminergic deficit or degeneration of serotonergic neurons, and this process is also known to occur early in Alzheimer's dementia.8\r\n\r\nGalantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is used in the treatment of dementia. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exist not only on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites but also on those located on axon terminals and are involved in the modulation of multiple neurotransmitter releases. Neuronal nAChR is a family of ligand-gated ion channels that are widely distributed in the brain and are controlled by acetylcholine and nicotine receptor agonists. In the genetically depressive rats, nicotine showed antidepressant-like effects through the involvement of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype. The α4 subunit in combination with the β2 subunit mediates dopaminergic and nonadrenergic release.9 Modulation of nAChR facilitates the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate.10 Striatal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with high affinity for nicotinic agonists are involved with the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine.11 Dopamine deficiency is associated with anhedonia, lack of interest, and psychomotor slowing (bradyphrenia), and it may arise as a consequence of cholinergic defects involving nAChR. Studies suggest galantamine in addition to mediating cholinergic neurotransmission also through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may influence several other neurotransmitter systems, possibly modulating the activity of serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and GABA in certain nerve tracts.12,13 So, it is possible that galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia, may also have some antidepressant effect.\r\n\r\nIf large studies prove this effect, we may not need to use an antidepressant in addition to a cholinesterase inhibitor in patients who have depression with dementia. This means less medication usage and potentially less adverse effect to these patients.",

      "title": "Reactive Psychoses Revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "title": "Childhood dissociation as a precursor of mood disorder: A 5 years follow-up case study",
      "abstract": "Sir, Dissociative symptoms are seen in patients with psychiatric problems and exist in a continuum from common normal phenomena like daydreaming and attention lapses through to pathological failure to integrate feelings, thoughts and action.[1] Dissociative symptoms have been well described as part of mood disorder,[23] but there is no literature, which mentions dissociative disorder in adolescents presenting later as depressive disorder following a prolonged follow-up. We hereby report a case of adolescent dissociative disorder, which went to develop clinically significant major depressive disorder (MDD) over 5 years. A 13-year-old Asian, boy, from urban area of East India, with normal birth and developmental history, past history of febrile convulsions till the age of 6 years, medical history of bronchial asthma and ankyloglossia, family history of single manic episode in father and dissociative convulsions in mother, presented in November 2003 to the Outpatient Department (OPD) of Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi, India with reduced interest in studies, episodes of sudden unarousable \"sleep,\" lasting as long as 14–16 h and sudden awakening for 2 weeks. Simultaneously, there are periods of unresponsiveness for 16–18 h starting and ending abruptly with no response to noxious stimuli and complete amnesia. An initial impression of hypersomnia unspecified with a possibility of dissociative disorder was made, and he was admitted for investigation and management. He was responsive to behavioral management comprising of the problem behavior extinction and differential reinforcement of alternative behavior. Fluoxetine was started as he was noted to be sad and disinterested. Pentothal interview was unremarkable, and Video electroencephalogram with quantitative analysis during apparent period of unresponsiveness showed no sleep changes or abnormal focal or generalized discharges. Polysomnography was also unremarkable except for increased rapid eye movement latency and relatively increased percentage of Stage 3 and 4 sleep in total sleep time. Mental status did not reveal any depressive cognition. With the above regimen, he showed good response and a diagnosis of dissociative disorder unspecified was kept at discharge. He came for regular follow-up till 1 year, but thereafter did not report till 3 years, a period in which he had stopped his medicines, maintaining well. He reported again in November 2007 with a 3 months history of low mood, irritability, poor concentration, difficulty in studying and two suicidal attempts. He was admitted with a diagnosis of severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms. Fluoxetine was increased to 40 mg but he developed significant deterioration with hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, anger outbursts and grandiose claims. An impression of antidepressant-induced manic switch was made and he was put on electroconvulsive therapy as he also expressed significant suicidal ideations and attempted once in the ward to hang himself during the course. With this he had good response and after 8 sessions he was put on lamotrigine considering family history of mania, high impulsivity, and age of onset, and it was increased up to 200 mg/day on which he attained remission over 4 weeks and was discharged from hospital. This can be observed as an absorbing case considering the way the clinical presentation evolved over a period of 5 years. To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar presentation and evolution of psychopathology in children and adolescents. There were genetic vulnerabilities to both bipolarity and dissociative disorder, which may have been exposed to an examination failure stress and brought about the symptoms in the child. Draijer and Langeland have noted that severity of dissociation could be predicted by maternal dysfunction; in our case we could speculate that the maternal dissociation was a response to escape some overwhelming stress and the patient having witnessed these attacks took a similar route to escape his stressor.[3] About the periods of unresponsiveness and \"sleep\" noted in our patient, it has been noted by Putnam et al. that the young patients may recurrently cycle through sleep and drowsy states more than the older population.[4] Our subject had displayed symptoms of depression in the first episode of illness itself- as per Hornstein and Putnam there may be a number of clusters within which dissociative behavior can overlap with a number of internalizing disorders like depression, anxiety etc.[5] This patient demonstrated gradual response to psychotherapeutic interventions, although a pentothal interview interestingly revealed the persistence of amnesia for the month in which he did not pass his examinations, a psychological and social stressor as per Srinath et al.,[6] who noted academic pressures to be an important underpinning among Indian children attending psychiatric OPD with features suggestive of \"hysteria.\" The switch induced by the antidepressant added yet another facet to the case as there have been observations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced hypomanic switch in patients of dissociative disorder.[7] There have been proposed hypotheses of dissociative identity disorders (DIDs) and bipolar disorder as been lying on a continuum based on the phasic alterations of the DID patient's personalities and the bipolar subject's affective changes.[8] On a similar note, our subject's longitudinal course of illness gave an opportunity to observe the evolution of this process. Thus, our patient was a candidate who fell into the bipolar spectrum constellation with age of onset added to his predisposing factors. In a Norwegian sample, it was noted that there is a significantly higher prevalence of dissociative symptoms in bipolar II subjects when compared to MDD patients.[9] Long-term outcome and prognosis of dissociative disorder with onset in childhood or adolescence in a large German sample revealed that more than 50% of the patients went on to develop anxiety or somatoform disorder over a clinical course of around 10 years but mood disorder was not reported. This makes a strong point toward the possible common lineage between these two groups of disorders and may raise a theoretical possibility of dissociation being a forerunner to bipolarity in clinical populations and thus helping clinicians' pickup occult bipolarity in dissociative disorders and instituting early treatment. Further research in the coming years may help shed light on this interesting probability.",

The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

Cravings are mediated by brain activation in the amygdala region. Cravings can be activated by exposure to drug cues via classical conditioning. Memories associated with substance use can trigger a craving. Usually, cravings decrease in frequency and intensity as recovery progresses and the client abstains from substance use. The objectives of this chapter are to help the client identify and label a craving to use substances, to teach the client to monitor and rate the level of intensity of cravings, to identify internal and external factors that trigger cravings, and to teach cognitive, behavioral, environmental, and interpersonal strategies to manage alcohol or drug cravings.",

Dependence was defined by a compulsion to take a drug, and drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome and acute disorders) and social disturbance. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

      "abstract": "While pain has traditionally been understood within a medical model that equates pain to tissue damage or disease, this understanding is not consistent with everyday observations of pain or with clinical examples of persistent pain where there is often very little correlation between pain experienced and physical findings. This article considers psychological and multidimensional theories of pain, which are described within the historical context within which they were developed, including behavioural, cognitive, contextual and functional theories. Research into the multifactorial nature of persistent pain has tended to focus on mechanisms of pain development and maintenance or on the function of pain. Psychological approaches, which have focused on mechanism traditionally use disability, mood and quality of life measures to assess outcome, claiming little or no impact on pain intensity itself. By contrast, functional approaches include an explicit goal of reducing pain intensity, which is therefore measured as a key treatment outcome. Strong evidence exists from a range of sources of the important contribution of psychological and social factors to the experience of pain. However, evidence is still lacking about the specific mechanisms of change that are targeted by biopsychosocial interventions and about what treatment approach is likely to work best for whom.",

Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

      "title": "[Hypothyroidism--clinical findings, diagnosis, therapy. Thyroid tests should be performed on broad indications].",
      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical entity resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones or, more rarely, from their impaired activity at tissue level. It is a common condition, with a prevalence of 1.9 per cent in women, and the prevalence increases with age. Hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired, primary or secondary, chronic or transient. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by disease or treatment which destroys the thyroid gland or interferes with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is the predominant cause of primary hypothyroidism in countries such as Sweden where severe iodine deficiency is non-existent. Another cause of primary hypothyroidism, chronic or transient, is previous radio-iodine or surgical treatment of hypothyroidism. In secondary or central hypothyroidism, which is very rare, there is a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH activity, due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. The clinical features of hypothyroidism are dependent on the patient's age, the presence of other disease, and the rate at which hypothyroidism develops. As thyroid hormones are universal determinants of organ function, there may be a multiplicity of symptoms. Particularly in the elderly, the clinical features may be atypical, and the diagnosis easily missed. First line tests for hypothyroidism are analyses of the concentrations of free thyroxine (T4) and TSH in serum. In primary hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH high. In central hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH generally low or normal, though slightly increased levels of biologically inactive TSH may also occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterised by a normal serum level of T4, an increased level of TSH, and the absence of clinical symptoms. When a diagnosis of chronic hypothyroidism is confirmed, treatment with laevothyroxine is started, the initial dose being adjusted to the age and general condition of the patient, and the duration and severity of hypothyroidism. As a rule, full thyroxine replacement therapy should bring the serum TSH level into the normal range. In central hypothyroidism, laevothyroxine treatment is similar, but pituitary function must be evaluated and, if necessary, corticosteroid replacement be instituted before laevothyroxine treatment is started.",

El diagnóstico de DSH requiere la presencia de malestar o dificultades interpersonales asociadas a un deseo sexual disminuido que no puede explicarse por otra afección psiquiátrica, y que no se debe exclusivamente a una enfermedad o sustancia. El DSH puede afectar gravemente al bienestar emocional y a las relaciones y sucede en mujeres premenopáusicas y posmenopáusicas. Hasta hace poco, el diagnóstico de DSH requería un extenso examen de un médico experimentado en diagnósticos de disfunción sexual femenina (DSF). La prueba del deseo sexual inhibido (PDSI) es un método de diagnóstico abreviado concebido para ayudar a los médicos que no son especialistas en DSF a diagnosticar el DSH adquirido en las mujeres. Es necesario profundizar en el estudio del DSH para comprender mejor la etiología y valorar las distintas opciones terapéuticas. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most common type of female sexual dysfunction (FSD). A diagnosis of HSDD requires evidence of personal distress or interpersonal difficulty associated with low sexual desire that cannot be better accounted for by another psychiatric condition and is not due exclusively to a medical condition or substance. HSDD can have a major impact on women's emotional wellbeing and relationships and occurs in both pre- and post-menopausal women. Until recently, diagnosis of HSDD required an extensive diagnostic interview conducted by a clinician with experience in the diagnosis of FSD. The decreased sexual desire screener (DSDS) is a brief diagnostic instrument that has been developed to aid clinicians who are not experts in FSD to diagnose generalized acquired HSDD in women. There is a need for greater understanding of the etiology of HSDD and for more therapeutic options.",

Everyone has a level of anxiety called temporary and normal. If a person wants, he can overcome it. And if anxiety persists for a long time, it will not be able to cope on its own, and this will have a negative impact on human health and disrupt normalcy. Increased levels of anxiety, along with the emergence of various diseases, lead to a significant decline in quality of life. There are psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety, which are determined by certain methods in science. The most obvious of the psychological symptoms -obscure problems -unjustified tense experiences.In psychology, anxiety is an emotional state with a negative connotation. Anxiety is characterized by the expectation of something negative, such as an adverse outcome or adverse outcome. Anxiety is a person's experience in different situations (joy, sorrow, shame, anger, fear, etc.). Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Forexample: confusion, anxiety, excitement, indifference, impatience, delay, etc. There are other meanings of the mental state of anxiety, which are: depression -a shameful mental state accompanied by anxiety; Propaganda is a phenomenon that takes place notonly in a state of anxiety, but also in a state of anger and rage; grief is a state of mind accompanied by anxiety, worry, grief, mental state is a state of mind, violence is a state of mind, grief accompanied by long-term anxiety, etc., so anxiety is a double state of mind.",

      "title": "The Life-Changing Diagnosis in a Patient With Treatment-Resistant Depression, From Darkness to Light and Healing",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Standard depression treatments often provide partial relief but fail to address the underlying cognitive and motivational deficits associated with undiagnosed comorbid Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), leaving patients feeling stuck in an endless cycle of procrastination, fatigue, and low mood. This case study explores how a missed diagnosis can lead to years of failed depression treatment and how crucial the diagnosis of comorbid conditions in both depression and ADHD is. Methods: Case report. A 36-year-old health professional presented with chronic insomnia, severe anxiety, low motivation, and persistent depressive symptoms that significantly impacted his professional and academic performance. Despite multiple trials of SSRIs, SNRIs, and antipsychotic augmentation, he continued to struggle with procrastination, difficulty initiating tasks, and performance anxiety, leading to numerous exam failures resulting in low self-esteem, self-doubt, emotional exhaustion, and thoughts of self-harm. He developed a dependence on clonazepam (4 mg daily) to manage his chronic insomnia, leading to anxiety. This led to cognitive clouding and emotional instability, which exacerbated his struggle with low motivation, attention, and memory difficulties. Insomnia, mind-wandering, forgetfulness, and irritability continued with poor response to medications. An ADHD assessment was conducted using DSM–5 diagnostic criteria, and diagnosis of Adult ADHD Combined Type was confirmed. The patient was given a trial of Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) 30 mg initially and increased to 50 mg once daily, along with venlafaxine 150 mg OD. The introduction of the stimulant brought about a near-immediate improvement in the patient’s condition. He reported increased focus, motivation, and productivity. Procrastination decreased, leading to better academic performance, cognitive clarity, improved sleep, and emotional engagement, resulting in better treatment outcomes. The patient could gradually taper clonazepam and pass his post-graduate clinical exams. The patient responded to a combination of stimulant and antidepressant immediately and described the diagnosis as life-changing. This emphasised further the importance of looking for comorbid conditions while assessing any patient with treatment-resistant depression. Results: Standard antidepressants alone can fail in addressing underlying causes like executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation associated with undiagnosed Adult ADHD. Robust treatment plans should address both ADHD and any comorbid conditions. Conventional antidepressant treatment proved ineffective until the introduction of Vyvanse and venlafaxine, which highlights the need for ADHD screening in individuals with persistent depression. Conclusion: Comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety in Adult ADHD can further complicate recognition and proper management, leading to symptom masking and misdiagnosis. The negative impact of undiagnosed and untreated adult ADHD is multifaceted, affecting education, employment, career, and financial stability.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria.

El registro del grado de agitacion en una escala de 100 puntos, proporciona la retroalimentacion necesaria para proseguir, revalorar, o concluir el tratamiento, dependiendo de los resultados obtenidos. Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

      "title": "Menstrual Disorders Related to Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Eating Disorders (ED) are associated with multiple physical complications that strongly affect the physical health of these young and fragile patients and can also cause significant mortality, the highest among psychiatric pathologies. Among the various organic complications, albeit still little known, the gynecological implications, up to infertility, are very widespread. Both among adolescent and adult patients, gynecological symptoms can be very widespread and range from menstrual irregularities to amenorrhea, from vaginitis to ovarian polycystosis, up to complications during the gestational phase and in postpartum, in addition to the possible consequences on the unborn child. Among the most frequent and significant gynecological disorders in women with ED, there are menstrual irregularities that may occur with oligomenorrhea or even amenorrhea. This symptom, although no longer part of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for defining Anorexia Nervosa (AN), must be considered a very relevant event in the overall evaluation of young women and adolescents with eating disorders. Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea in ED patients is related to psychological distress, excessive exercise, disordered eating, or a combination of these factors which results in suppression of the hypothalamic- pituitary-ovarian axis, resulting in hypoestrogenism. The objective of this paper is to summarize the causes and the mechanism underlying the menstrual disorders and to provide a better understanding of the correlation between the reproductive system and the mechanisms that regulate food intake and eating habits. In addition, early recognition of risk factors for eating disorders for gynecological implications can help put more accurate assessments of patients to prevent potentially fatal complications. The importance of the involvement of specialist gynecologists in the multidisciplinary team that has to follow patients with eating disorders is also discussed.",

      "title": "Pediatric Stress: Hormonal Mediators and Human Development",
      "abstract": "Stress activates the central and peripheral components of the stress system, i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the arousal/sympathetic system. The principal effectors of the stress system are corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), arginine vasopressin, the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and β-endorphin, the glucocorticoids, and the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine. Appropriate responsiveness of the stress system to stressors is a crucial prerequisite for a sense of well-being, adequate performance of tasks and positive social interactions. By contrast, inappropriate responsiveness of the stress system may impair growth and development, and may account for a number of endocrine, metabolic, autoimmune and psychiatric disorders. The development and severity of these conditions primarily depend on the genetic vulnerability of the individual, the exposure to adverse environmental factors and the timing of the stressful event(s), given that prenatal life, infancy, childhood and adolescence are critical periods characterized by increased vulnerability to stressors. The developing brain undergoes rapid growth and is characterized by high turnover of neuronal connections during the prenatal and early postnatal life. These processes and, hence, brain plasticity, slow down during childhood and puberty, and plateau in young adulthood. Hormonal actions in early life, and to a much lesser extent later, can be organizational, i.e., can have effects that last for long periods of time, often for the entire life of the individual. Hormones of the stress system and sex steroids have such effects, which influence the behavior and certain physiologic functions of individuals for life. Exposure of the developing brain to severe and/or prolonged stress may result in hyperactivity/hyperreactivity of the stress system, with resultant amygdala hyperfunction (fear reaction), decreased activity of the hippocampus (defective glucocorticoid-negative feedback, cognition), and the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system (dysthymia, novelty-seeking, addictive behaviors), hyperactivation of the HPA axis (hypercortisolism), suppression of reproductive, growth, thyroid and immune functions, and changes in pain perception. These changes may be accompanied by abnormal childhood, adolescent and adult behaviors, including excessive fear (‘inhibited child syndrome’) and addictive behaviors, dysthymia and/or depression, and gradual development of components of the metabolic syndrome X, including visceral obesity and essential hypertension. Prenatal stress exerted during the period of sexual differentiation may be accompanied by impairment of this process with behavioral and/or somatic sequelae. The vulnerability of individuals to develop varying degrees and/or components of the above life-long syndrome is defined by as yet unidentified genetic factors, which account for up to 60% of the variance. CRH has marked kindling and glucocorticoids have strong consolidating properties, hence both of these hormones are crucial in development and can alone produce the above syndrome. CRH and glucocorticoids may act in synergy, as in acoustic startle, while glucocorticoids may suppress or stimulate CRH, as in the hypothalamus and amygdala, respectively. A CRH type 1 receptor antagonist, antalarmin, inhibits both the development and expression of conditioned fear in rats, and has anxiolytic properties in monkeys. Profound stressors, such as those from sexual abuse, may elicit the syndrome in older children, adolescents and adults. Most frequently, chronic dysthymia and/or depression may develop in association with gastrointestinal complaints and/or the premenstrual tension syndrome. A lesser proportion of individuals may develop the classic posttraumatic stress disorder, which is characterized by hypocortisolism and intrusive and avoidance symptoms; in younger individuals it may present as dissociative personality disorder.",

We present a case involving episodic cognitive disturbances, social withdrawal, anhedonia, and persistent suicidal ideation occurring after ejaculation. The patient experienced a significant diagnostic delay, resulting in progressive functional decline. Despite multi-drug therapy and immunotherapy, clinical improvement remained limited. This case highlights the limitations of current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. There is a pressing need for psychiatric integration in POIS management and the development of culturally informed diagnostic frameworks.",

      "title": "Care of the sexually active depressed patient.",
      "abstract": "There are several possible causes of sexual dysfunction in depressed patients. A core symptom of depression is anhedonia, including loss of libido. Therefore, determining a cause of sexual dysfunction in a depressed patient can be very difficult, and the differential diagnosis must include a primary sexual dysfunction, sexual dysfunction associated with general medical and psychiatric disorders, and sexual dysfunction associated with treatments for psychiatric disorders. Of particular clinical interest is sexual dysfunction associated with different classes of antidepressant drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or venlafaxine. Sexual dysfunction's pharmacologic basis is thought to be stimulation of 5-HT2 receptors. Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, most frequently presenting as a reduction in libido or delayed orgasm, may not pose a large burden for patients in acute treatment. However, in long-term treatment, patients are generally well, and anything that interferes with sexual functioning will be a greater problem and will contribute strongly to noncompliance. Different strategies are advised when dealing with sexual dysfunction in depressed patients treated with antidepressant drugs: waiting for a spontaneous resolution of a problem, reduction in antidepressant drug dosages, drug holidays, adjunctive pharmacotherapy, or switching antidepressants. Perhaps the best way is to avoid sexual dysfunction by starting treatment with an antidepressant with proven acute and long-term efficacy that is devoid of sexual side effects, for example, mirtazapine, bupropion, or nefazodone.",

Chronic abacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a disease of yet not clarified aetiology where the symptoms, voiding dysfunction and pelvic pain are difficult to alleviate. The aim of this study is to arrive at an understanding of how it influences the individual afflicted. Materials and methods. Ten men with CP/CPPS were interviewed about their situation. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using a phenomenological perspective. Results. The often severe symptoms influence well-being and a life in more or less constant fear of a relapse is described. A majority manages, despite the problems, to endure and conceal the problems. The situation can, however, become unbearable and force the man to seek solitude or lose his temper. Social isolation and restrictions at work and during recreational activities were thus reported by those more severely afflicted. Confirmation from the healthcare system that the disease is not life threatening and affirmation that they are not unwanted and neglected are essential. Conclusions. Men with CP/CPPS are mostly able to live a normal life, although it is often difficult and the people around them are rarely given an insight into their world, where their existence is focused on attempts to obtain confirmation, control abrupt mood fluctuations and develop coping strategies. They have much in common with other patient groups afflicted by chronic pain, such as difficulties in performing at work and severe fatigue. More specific for CP/CPPS is the presence of additional symptoms, which individually can severely impair quality of life. Accepting the situation and developing coping strategies are consequently challenges for a man with CP/CPPS.",

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

Studies in the literature have reported several causes and mechanisms of injuries. Links between injuries and previous comorbidities have emerged from the extant literature; obesity and/or metabolic disorders, seizures (associated with overstimulation of the eyes), heart malfunctions, high basal and abrupt increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), prolonged stress, and poor posture have been associated with injuries.

The depressed elderly show less sad mood, more anxiety and somatic complaints that depressed young patients. The prognosis is generally poor, because the disorder in the elderly has increased relapse rate, increased risk of death from suicide and overall mortality compared with people of other ages. Also is frequent comorbidity with other medical illnesses and with other psychiatric disorders, which further dims the prognosis.

Only a few authors have concentrated on this element of the presentation in the FTD case literature.[2] A 29-year-old woman, who had been married for 10 years, educated till high school, and working as an assistant in a parlor but not for the past 4 months, was brought with complaints of forgetfulness, irrelevant talk, irritability, impaired self-care, and episodic singing and dancing claiming to be possessed by a goddess lasting 5–10 minutes for the past 4 months. The symptoms were insidious in onset and progressive in nature. No past or family history of any psychiatric disorder was found. On mental status examination, rapport could not be established, the patient was oriented to only one person, and there were increased psychomotor activity in the form of restlessness, irrelevant talks with a confused, labile affect, formal thought disorder and preservation, and lack of insight and impaired judgment. A neurological evaluation showed equivocal Babinski signs bilaterally. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed more mild atrophy of the lateral temporal lobe than the medial temporal lobe [Figures 1 and 2]. Electroencephalogram (EEG), serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) autoimmune encephalopathy panels, and additional exhaustive testing for endocrinologic, immunologic, and infectious etiology were noncontributory. There was no improvement in treatment with antipsychotics and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The patient on follow-up showed deterioration in her symptoms along with the inability to recognize her family members. The patient passed away two years after the onset of her symptoms.Figure 1: T1 sagittal and coronal MRI sections, respectively, show mild prominence of sulcal spaces in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal region with the prominence of bilateral sylvian fissures (more in temporal lobes)—suggestive of mild cortical atrophy, which is highly disproportionate to the ageFigure 2: T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) coronal MRI sections, respectively, suggest hyperintensities, more pronounced at bilateral frontal white matter regionThe frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD) are a category of illnesses marked by frontal and temporal lobe degeneration. The average age of onset is 45–60 years (range: 20–75); males are more likely to be afflicted.[3] Up to 50% of patients have a favorable family history, and a variety of genetic factors have been found.[4] The tau gene on chromosome 17 is mutated in the biggest single group: FTDP-17. The clinical appearance of FTD is diverse and typically subtle, with behavioral problems, personality changes, lack of empathy, and motivation dominating. Early retirement may be required due to a loss of planning and judgment. Misdiagnoses such as treatment-resistant depression or Alzheimer's disease are common among families and caregivers who ascribe behavioral changes to marital troubles or a \"mid-life crisis.\" Behavioral rigidity, disinhibition, loss of social skills, fatuousness, emotional lability, and impulsivity are common as the disease progresses and are often accompanied by executive dysfunction, decreased verbal fluency, impaired abstraction, difficulty shifting set, motor and verbal perseveration, and stereotypies.[1] FTLD advances faster than Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with the FTD clinical subtype, concomitant motor neuron illness, or tau-negative neuropathology have the quickest progression.[5] Our patient's sickness progressed faster and steadily, which conformed to the natural history of FTD caused by a genetic mutation. It is frequently coupled with mental symptoms and extremely little (or perhaps nonexistent) brain atrophy on MRI, which can make the clinical picture difficult to interpret. To explain conversion disorder misdiagnoses, a number of theories have been presented. The \"subtle interplay\" of biological and psychological models of neuropsychiatric illness, limited access to advanced imaging, current customs of neurological evaluation of functional neurological symptom disorders, and a limited neurobiological understanding of functional neurological disorders are among them.[6] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "abstract": "Women are more likely than men to meet lifetime criteria for an anxiety disorder. Moreover, anxiety is a risk factor for the development of other psychiatric conditions, including major depression. Numerous studies have identified evidence of sex differences in anxiety disorders, and there is considerable research concerning factors that may contribute to vulnerability for anxiety in females. In addition to psychosocial influences, biological components such as the female reproductive hormone cycle have also been implicated. Although psychotropic medication is more likely to be prescribed to women, there is little controlled data available concerning sex differences in the efficacy and/or tolerability of pharmacotherapy in anxiety disorders. This chapter provides an overview of the impact of gender in the epidemiology, phenomenology, course, and treatment response in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder (PD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).",

      "title": "The Psychological Impact of Chronic Prostate Disorders: Addressing Mental Health in BPH Patients",
      "abstract": "Chronic prostate disorders, particularly benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), significantly impact not only the physical health but also the mental well-being of affected men, especially as they age. BPH, characterized by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as frequent urination, nocturia, and urgency, can disrupt daily activities, sleep, and social interactions, leading to a diminished quality of life. The psychological burden associated with BPH and other chronic prostate conditions, including chronic prostatitis and prostate cancer, is often underrecognized but substantial. Men with BPH frequently experience anxiety, depression, social isolation, and reduced self-esteem, exacerbated by symptoms such as sexual dysfunction and fears surrounding treatment outcomes. This review explores the psychological impact of living with BPH and other prostate disorders, highlighting the link between chronic urinary symptoms and emotional distress. It discusses how symptoms such as sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and social limitations contribute to mental health issues like anxiety and depression. Additionally, the review emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to treatment that integrates mental health care into the management of chronic prostate disorders. Addressing the psychological aspects of BPH can improve both quality of life and overall treatment outcomes, underscoring the importance of mental health support in patient care.

Worry is a cognitive activity that involves repeatedly thinking about potential negative future events, such as “What if I can't finish this task?” “What if I never graduate?” “What if I have some type of illness?” According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in order to warrant a diagnosis of GAD an individual must experience excessive and uncontrollable worry for at least 6 months, as well as three or more associated symptoms that are present, more days than not, over this time period. These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

A diagnosis of depressive disorder depends on the underlying cause, and on the nature, severity and duration of symptoms. Management involves accurate diagnosis and treatment of medical illness, practical interventions to resolve concurrent family, social and economic stressors, and emotional support. Cognitive, behavioral and brief psychodynamic therapies may be helpful in selected cases. Antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy have a role in the treatment of severe or persistent depression associated with suicidal behavior, marked psychomotor retardation, starvation or other life-threatening symptoms. Suicidal thoughts are frequent in older patients with concurrent major depression and chronic illness, and measures to ensure patient safety are a priority.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Mit dem Begriff Fatigue werden Zustände ungewöhnlicher Müdigkeit und Erschöpfung beschrieben, die in Zusammenhang mit verschiedenen körperlichen Erkrankungen, insbesondere bei Krebs, multipler Sklerose, Parkinson und rheumatoider Arthritis, auftreten können. Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt. Ebenso werden die Herausforderungen für die medizinische Versorgung skizziert und Hinweise für den Umgang im klinischen Alltag gegeben.",

For at least 3 months, it exhibits varying symptoms of vertigo, unsteadiness, or dizziness. Methods: Research articles regarding PPPD were searched by viewing the Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases online. A search strategy using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis was used. Results: It presents a typical chronic vestibular system and brain malfunction that result in persistent dizziness, nonspinning vertigo, and/or unsteadiness. Persistent nonvertiginous dizziness and hypersensitivity to motion and visual stimuli are the main signs and symptoms of PPPD. These symptoms appeared either when there were no active neuro-otologic illnesses or when an episodic vestibular condition was present but could not completely account for the symptoms. Psychological mechanisms that resemble cognitive models of health anxiety and panic disorder are involved in the PPPDs development and maintenance. Conclusion: Since PPPDs diagnostic criteria only involve symptoms, the patient's clinical history is crucial in making the diagnosis. Once diagnosed, effective communication and personalized treatment plans, such as serotonergic medicines, cognitive behavioral therapy, and specialized physical therapy (vestibular rehabilitation), help manage PPPD. Since PPPD is a relatively recent clinical diagnosis, many medical practitioners who treat patients who feel dizzy are unfamiliar with it.",

The onset of depression is influenced by various modifiable and unmodifiable risk factors. Contributing factors may include hormonal changes and feelings of being overwhelmed by childcare responsibilities. Fear of being unable to cope, a low socioeconomic background, and fatigue from frequent sleep disturbances also play a role. Help-seeking behavior depends on the woman’s self-awareness of being unwell. It is influenced by family members’ perceptions of her emotional decline. Beliefs about the illness’s causes, contributing behaviors, and treatment options further impact her behavior. By applying the nursing process, the nurse can identify, intervene, and modify risk factors, thereby preventing or mitigating the severity of perinatal depression and enhancing the well-being of the perinatal woman, her baby, and her family.",

      "abstract": "A somatic symptom disorder (SSD) diagnosis is made when a person places emphasis on physical symptoms such as pain, exhaustion, or shortness of breath so much that it causes significant suffering and/or functional issues. The individual's thoughts, sentiments, and activities are an overstated reaction to such symptoms. Regardless of whether the physical symptoms are connected to a diagnosable medical condition, the person experiences symptoms and believes they are ill. When a person exhibits symptoms that satisfy the diagnostic standards of an SSD, the disease should be identified. However, due to the disorder's frequent co-occurrence, particularly with anxiety and depressive disorders, support for these concurrent diagnoses should be sought. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, and medication are all examples of effective treatments for SSD. It has been demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) aid in treating symptoms. The authors describe the case of an eight-year-old boy with complaints of abdominal pain that were unexplained by various tests. The pain lasted 10 years and was episodic (each episode lasted around 10 days; one particular episode lasted approximately six months). Multiple investigations were conducted, but no physiological reason for his symptoms was discovered. His evaluation was conducted by an interdisciplinary team that included neurologists, psychiatrists, surgeons, and doctors. The underlying cause was subsequently determined to be SSD. As people with SSD present to general practitioners and the emergency room rather than psychiatric facilities, this incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need to advocate for an accurate diagnosis of this condition.",

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated. The authors report no financial or other relationship relevant to the subject of this article.",

The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

      "abstract": "Typisch für Depressionen ist – und dies gilt auch im Alter –, dass sie häufig, multifaktoriell bedingt, unterdiagnostiziert und untertherapiert sind, erläuterte PD M. Axel Wollmer, Chefarzt der Klinik für Gerontopsychiatrie an der Asklepios Klinik Nord – Ochsenzoll Hamburg. Bis zu 20 % der über 65-Jährigen leiden an einer depressiven Störung und etwa 6 % davon erfüllen die diagnostischen Kriterien einer depressiven Episode. Häufig stehen jedoch bei dieser Klientel andere Erkrankungen im Vordergrund und die Beschwerden werden als körperliche Erkrankungen oder \"normale\" Alterserscheinung (Agism) fehlinterpretiert. Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass Depressionen im Alter oft atypisch bzw. subsyndromal verlaufen, d. h. die depressiven Syndrome erfüllen nicht alle Kriterien einer Depression nach den internationalen Klassifikationssystemen. So kann das Gefühl von Traurigkeit oder gedrückter Stimmung fehlen und stattdessen Schmerzen, Gedächtnisstörungen, Wahn, Reizbarkeit, Agitiertheit oder Schlafstörungen dominieren. Insbesondere bei männlichen älteren Patienten sind Schlafstörungen und Wutausbrüche Indikatoren für eine Depression, die nicht auf die leichte Schulter genommen werden sollten, mahnte Wollmer. Das zeigt auch die hohe Suizidrate Älterer, die ab dem 65. Lebensjahr drastisch ansteigt.",

      "abstract": "There has long been recognition of the enormous and persistent personal and social consequences of mental illness. The chronicity of disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia, and the long-term if lower-level debilitation of depression and many neuroses, have substantial impacts on cognition, health, functioning and quality of life. They can leave many sufferers and their families with constrained, deprived, often devastated lives. The care of people with mental health problems in hospital or in community settings, support for their families and the treatment of symptoms as well as clinical and social sequelae generate considerable costs for health care, social services and other agencies. Directly or indirectly, there are also cost burdens for sufferers and their families. The consequences of mental illness, in other words, can be far-reaching and expensive.",

      "abstract": "El Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad (TDAH, en lo sucesivo), constituye uno de los trastornos del desarrollo neuropsicologico que en la actualidad afecta a mas ninos y adolescentes, se estima una prevalencia de en torno al 5%, segun el DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); y en el que coexisten diversos sintomas que van a ocasionar a la persona que lo padece serias dificultades para poder adaptarse de forma optima a los contextos en los cuales se ve inmersa. Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of psychotropic medication (see Appendix). In spite of a high prevalence of sexual disorders secondary to psychopharmacological agents, there is a paucity of studies in the medical literature that clearly document the magnitude of the problem. Most reported instances of sexual disorders etiologically related to psychotropic medication are found in case reports and case series. The differential diagnosis of sexual dysfunction includes the sexual disorders associated with mental illness. In order to identify the etiology of sexual dysfunction in a patient with a mental disorder, the clinician must take a careful sexual history during the initial phase of treatment. Most patients do not spontaneously report sexual dysfunction to their therapists during the first session [1]. Decisions about prescribing psychotropic agents without establishing the baseline sexual functioning of a patient may obfuscate the process of differentiating between a sexual dysfunction caused by medication and one preexisting secondary to a mental disorder. Underreporting by patients during the initial interview does not preclude clinicians' exploring data",

Major symptoms include fatigue lasting for more than 6 months, low-grade fever, moderate lymphadenopathy, muscle and joint pain, and various psychological presentations. Since no specific laboratory tests are available, clinical diagnosis demands that known causes of chronic fatigue should be excluded.

In introduction, the author states methodological problems that accompany investigations of significance of traumatic events in onset, course and outcome of psychoses. The results of numerous studies have confirmed importance of those factors which can act even in pre and perinatal period, as well as in childhood (sexual and physical abuse) and later life period (growing in urban environment, migration, ethnicity, discrimination for sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap, appearance). Psychotic symptoms and stigma relating to mental disorder are also stressful for patients of this psychiatric population. 'Sensitization' refers to the process whereby (repeated) exposure to a certain event increases the behavioral and biological response to later exposure to a similar event, even if the later exposure is not as severe. Interaction of gene and environmental factors (biological synergism) and dysregulation of hypothalamus- pituitary-adrenal axis, the key mediator in response to stress is a mechanism responsible for the development of psychosis. The author also states the current dilemmas relating to classification and diagnosis of Acute and transient psychotic disorders (ICD-10), thy only form of psychoses which is the existence of psychosocial traumatic events in the period that precedes the development of symptoms, one of the necessary criterion for diagnosis.",

In the first 3 cases (2 amenorrhea and 1 MMR), we found psychogenic factors: an insult to feminine development after rape (case 1) or marriage problems (cases 2 and 3). In the case of a recurrent MP, no relevant psychological etiology was found. Furthermore, some of the patient's relatives had menstrual or peripartum psychiatric disorders. Menstrual disorders' etiology can be psychogenic or hormonal.

Inadequate identification and assessment of adults with autism not only leads to inadequate care but can also result in inadequate recognition and treatment of coexisting mental and physical health problems. Whereas care for children and young people is relatively well coordinated6 this is often not the case for adults. Falling between and being passed around services is a particular problem for adults with autism who have an IQ over 70 and do not have severe and enduring mental illness, as they may be excluded from both learning disabilities and mental health services.3 Social and economic exclusion affects a large proportion of adults with autism. Unemployment or underemployment is a considerable problem for adults with autism, including the 44% of those who do not have a learning disability,7 with almost 90% of this group unemployed.8\n\nThis article summarises the most recent recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on autism in adults.9\n\nNICE recommendations are based on systematic reviews of best available evidence and explicit …",

      "abstract": "Even though most cancer patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for any specific mental disorder [1], many experience symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbances that may interfere with their overall adjustment to their disease. Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting. In the general population, persistent insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety or depression [2].\r\n\r\nTo effectively adjust patient needs to optimal treatment interventions, health-care professionals must be able to distinguish normal adjustment to cancer from altered reactions to the disease. This paper will focus on anxiety and sleep disorders in the oncology setting and will describe their clinical presentation, assessment, aetiology and treatment.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

Uncertainty in illness is a condition that accompanies the patient from the moment of appearance of the first somatic symptoms of the disease and could be strengthened or weakened thanks to many psychosocial factors. The level of uncertainty is related to the level of stress, emotional disadaptation, affective states, coping strategies, mechanisms of psychological defense, etc. Uncertainty can perform destructive functions, acting as a trigger for stressful conditions and launching negative emotional experiences. As a positive function of uncertainty, one can note a possible positive interpretation of the patient's disease. In addition, the state of uncertainty allows the patient to activate the resources of coping with the disease, among which the leading role belongs to social support.",

      "abstract": "A number of behavioral, social, biological, and cultural factors are associated with suicide. However, the ability to predict an imminent suicide attempt remains problematic. Prior studies indicate that the manifest dream content of depressed, non-suicidal patients differs from that of depressed, suicidal patients. The dream imagery of depressed, suicidal patients contains themes of death, dying, violence, and departure. The dream imagery of depressed, non-suicidal patients contains themes of rejection, helplessness, hopelessness, humiliation, failure, and loss. In the present study, the dream reports of 52 depressed patients were collected and rated for various themes. Patients were divided into three groups: Depressed and non-suicidal; Depressed, with suicidal ideation; Depressed, with suicidal ideation and/or attempt(s). Themes of death and/or dying, and to a lesser extent, themes of violence, injury, and/or murder occurred with greater frequency in the dream reports of depressed patients with suicidal ideation and/or attempts, than in the dream reports of depressed patients without suicidal ideation or behavior. These observations correspond with the prevailing psychodynamic explanation of suicide; namely, that it is a murderous attack on the self that is identified with hated internalized objects.",

It therefore forms an important means of quantifying the NINCDS-AD RDA (McKhann et al., 1984) criteria for a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease, which require that there is impairment in memory functioning plus at least one other cognitive domain such as language, praxis, perceptual skills, problem-solving abilities, attention, or orientation, supported by the Folstein Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975), Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (BDRS) (Blessed et al., 1968), or a similar evaluation. These difficulties must interfere with everyday functional capacity. A diagnosis of possible Alzheimer’s disease is rendered when a patient presents with only a single progressive cognitive deficit, an atypical presentation, or when there is a medical or neuropsychiatric condition that might account for observed deficits but is not considered to be the cause of the dementia.",

Obsessions are intrusive and unwanted thoughts, images or feelings which elicit considerable anxiety and discomfort. Commonly recurring themes in obsessions are aggression, blasphemy, death and (unacceptable) sexual urges. Compulsions are repetitive, ritualistic behaviours or mental acts that are performed to reduce or neutralise the anxiety that is elicited by the obsessions.The most frequently encountered compulsions are ordering, counting, checking and washing. When the patient resists carrying out the compulsions, anxiety usually increases. Patients generally recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive and irrational. Nevertheless, the obsessions and com-pulsions cause marked distress, are timeconsuming and interfere signiicantly with the person’s social or occupational life. Many patients experience both obsessions and compulsions; only a minority presents with either obsessions or compulsions (Foa & Kozak). Ocd is classiied in dsm-4 as an anxiety disorder, although not all clinicians agree on this categorization (Nelson & Chouinard).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Suicide is a traumatic event for close relatives due to various factors, with bullying acting as a mediator. Bullying has been identified as a primary predictor of suicidal ideation and a contributing factor to suicide. Objective: This study aims to describe the pathway from bullying victimization to suicidal attempts in adolescents. Results: Adolescence is a period of peak physical health and a time of behavioral and emotional problems due to developmental factors, which can increase susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Adolescents who experience bullying report suicidal ideation more frequently, often on a weekly basis, due to psychiatric morbidity (OR = 7.78). The relationship between bullying and suicide is mediated by poor physical and mental health, especially among victims. Bullying victimization triggers psychological or behavioral problems that can lead to suicidal behavior, often mediated by mental health or psychological problems, such as internalization or substance use which serve as maladaptive coping strategies, with suicide ultimately becoming a final coping strategy. Conclusion: Psychological or mental health problems mediate the risk of suicidal attempts among bullied adolescents, although other pathways may also be involved.",

The diagnosis of bulimia nervosa (BN) is usually straightforward because the patient provides a clear history. In anorexia nervosa (AN) the opposite is usually true because the patient fears \"recovery.\" Medical assessments should continue every 6 months, long term, because medical complications can occur years after recovery. Physicians may fail to consider an ED as a possible diagnosis, even when suggestive physical signs and symptoms are present without asking questions that might lead to the diagnosis of an ED. Unexpected medication side effects can occur because of marked variation between individuals in absorption, distribution, receptors, medication effects, and medication interactions. Building rapport is essential to successful treatment in ED. In this regard ED patients often have greater confidence in medical doctors than psychological healthcare professionals.",

      "abstract": "Various factors contribute to a predisposition towards the excessive consumption of alcohol: socio-demographic factors, a disturbed family background or certain neurological disorders in childhood, a family background of heavy drinking or total abstinence, or a genetic predisposition towards the biochemical reactions of excessive drinking. Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

It can result in chronic mental and physical ill health, social difficulties and suicide. The disorder occurs across the lifespan; however, its characteristics and outcomes vary with the age of the sufferer. Children, adolescents, adults and the elderly may all present with a depressive illness but the characteristics, response to treatment and final outcome show considerable variations between age groups. The extent to which genetic and environmental factors and processes contribute to the onset may be influenced by the developmental components of human growth and ageing. Equally, the social context within which depressions occur are not the same at different points in life. There are also known to be differences in relative responses to psychological and pharmacological treatments across the lifespan. Unipolar Depression: A Lifespan Perspective examines these, and other, issues, focusing on the continuities and discontinuities that arise in the nature of the disorder and how genetic, hormonal, psychological and social processes operate differentially throughout life.

      "title": "Adjustment Disorder and Its Clinical Management",
      "abstract": "Adjustment disorder is a condition of subjective emotional distress triggered as a consequence of a meaningful change in life. The diagnosis of adjustment disorder is hindered by the difficult operational definition of stress and of its related concept of “vulnerability,” by the problem of disentangling symptoms of adjustment disorder from those attributable to comorbid anxiety and mood disorders, and by the poor boundaries of the disorder with other stress-related conditions on the one hand and with common adaptation to life events on the other. Despite the high frequency of its diagnosis in clinical settings, there has been relatively little research on the adjustment disorder and, consequently, very few hints about its treatments. Several psychotherapies have been developed to deal with patients diagnosed with adjustment disorder, with inconclusive evidence on their effectiveness. Antidepressants may abate the symptoms and help patients reacquire occupational and social functioning. The medium-term outcome of adjustment disorder is good, with 70 to 80% of those diagnosed with it showing no evidence of psychopathology when reassessed 5 years from the episode. However, when comorbid with a personality disorder or a substance use disorder, the short-term risk of suicide may be increased. The long-term outcome of adjustment disorder seems to be worse in children and adolescents than in adults. In particular, adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder were more likely than adults to have received a diagnosis of a severe mental disorder at the 5-year follow-up, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder.

      "title": "AB015. Medically unexplained symptoms in adolescence: a challenge for the future",
      "abstract": ": Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are a rising entity particularly among adolescents, that might be highly impairing. In the past, many terms such as psychosomatic symptoms, somatisation, functional disorders, somatoform disease have been used to define a heterogeneous group of physical symptoms without any organic underlying disease, but somehow related to emotional or psychological aspects of the patients’ life. Recently, the term MUS has been preferred as it captures the full range of conditions characterized by persistent physical symptoms that cannot yet be explained by any medical illness or injury. In the last years, there has been an increasing interest about MUS, which represent a significant disorder among adolescents, particularly in females. At present, MUS in adolescents is a great challenge for paediatricians and primary care physicians, but since its prevalence is increasing, it will become even more relevant in the next years. Necessarily, adolescents with unexplained physical symptoms and their families seek out medical assistance, through the general paediatrician, disease specialists or the emergency department. However, medical assistance itself, if not adequate or delayed, can maintain or even worsen the symptoms in an escalating vicious circle. The result is often cyclic disability, frustration and missed opportunities to collaborate to enhance the patient functionality. On the other hand, many paediatricians have inadequate knowledge of MUS and its approach, evaluation and management. Thus, my report will focus on MUS and specifically on epidemiological and on its variable clinical presentation. I will also discuss the possible risk factors for MUS especially focusing on adolescent’s personality and emotional disorders, cognitive and learning difficulties, previous adverse life or traumatic events, family medical or psychiatric history and on the school and peer group environment. Furthermore, the optimal evaluation strategy, which requires a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach, including medical and psychosocial assessment, will be extensively discussed. Such integrate way to manage adolescents with MUS should limit the high, often disproportionate, amounts of medical interventions required, such as numerous ER visits or hospitalizations, and unnecessary investigations. Last but not least, I will outline the successful management strategy for MUS. Primarily, engagement of families and patients is crucial; psychotherapy and physiotherapy are also winning weapons, whether associated with a good alliance between patient, family and paediatrician. Frequently, the appropriate intervention should also include an early psychiatric referral. In fact, a strict collaboration between paediatricians and psychiatrists may promote prompt confirmation of the diagnosis, but also timely treatment could improve the adolescent’s quality life, preventing the social and personal negative consequences. By way of example, I will describe few cases with different clinical presenting features recently admitted to our hospital, providing the details of their diagnostic approach, the multidisciplinary management and outcome.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J.

The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B.

This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D.

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].

For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

Relative to other major mental disorders, personality disorders are highly prevalent in the general population and they seriously compromise the individual's health, interpersonal relationships, and social functioning. High-quality treatment evaluations for personality disorders other than borderline are few, and the evidence currently allows identification of only possibly efficacious treatments. No one psychological treatment has been identified as superior, and there is considerable work to be done in identifying what works best with whom and over what time period. At present, a broad range of cognitive behavior, psychosocial, and psychodynamic therapies should remain on the agenda.",

Often described as tiredness, exhaustion, or lack of sleep, fatigue can progressively interfere with a patient’s physical and social activities, resulting in increased withdrawal. Fatigue is a symptom that possibly has the greatest potential to interfere with quality of life at the end of life. It has been reported to be the most common symptom that is linked to the clinical course of cancer and other chronic diseases.

Around 17–20% of female patients found with a defective &lt;i&gt;OTC&lt;/i&gt; gene on an X chromosome can suffer from OTC deficiency that may result in elevated levels of ammonia in the blood; this occurs when one of the X chromosomes become inactivated. Patients typically present with nausea, migraines, and a history of dietary protein avoidance. In more severe cases, ataxia, confusion, hallucinations, and cerebral oedema can occur. The OTC deficiency can thus remain undiagnosed in women for many years.&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Somatic comorbidity in psychiatric inpatients is commonly found; however, such disorders are rarely diagnosed or even treated adequately.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

In Poland, disability after stroke, affects 70% of patients and is definitely higher than in the other developed countries. Information that stroke affects young, sexually active persons is becoming more and more common, however this aspect of patients' functionality falls into the background, both for patients and specialists, as it seems to be less important than other disorders. These patients report the decrease of all sexual functions such as libido, erectile function, orgasm, vaginal lubrication and sexual satisfaction; the frequency of intercourse decreases significantly. The sexual dysfunction in these patients depends on many factors. Among them, we can distinguish between the extent of the focus of the stroke, the method of treatment and the level of general post-stroke disability. Some of the sexual disfunctions are temporary in the initial period they result mainly neurological deficit (aphasia, movement disorders, paresis, limbs paralysis) later on, psychological factors may start playing a significant role. These disturbances also show some dynamics over time. The etiology of sexual disorders after stroke is multi-functional. There are organic factors and also psychosocial and psychological. Among psychological factors, depression, anxiety and fear that the stroke can come back can lead to the decrease of one's sexual drive. Sexual dysfunction in patients after a stroke may be associated with a malfunction of the genitourinary system, including urinary incontinence.

      "abstract": "Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently prescribed (1) and are better tolerated than older antidepressants, side effects such as sexual dysfunction limit patient acceptance of these medications. DSM-IV-TR categorizes medication-induced sexual dysfunction as a type of substance-induced sexual dysfunction. (2) These dysfunctions are characterized by impairment of various sexual response phases (Table 1).

Zimmerman et al (4) compared psychiatrists' clinical assessments of depressed patients receiving ongoing treatment with results of a standardized side effects questionnaire and found that even though psychiatrists regularly inquired about sexual side effects, on the questionnaire patients reported higher rates of almost all sexual dysfunctions. The incidence of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction also can be difficult to ascertain because some sexual dysfunctions frequently accompany a primary psychiatric disorder (5) or physical illness. Balon (6) suggested that the incidence of SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction is 30% to 50%, although others have reported higher incidences. Few quality studies have focused on identifying the exact nature and causes of SSRI treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction. This article describes mechanisms that may be fundamental to SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction. Not just serotonin Although SSRIs are relatively selective for the serotonergic system, they affect other neurotransmitter systems as well (Table 2, page 32) (7) For example, at high dosages paroxetine is believed to block norepinephrine reuptake, and it has a clinically significant anticholinergic effect. …",

These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions.

      "abstract": "There are several problems facing aging men, especially sexual dysfunction, hypogonadism, and psychologic changes. This constellation of changes is sometimes referred to as \"manopause\" or \"andropause.\" Unlike the dramatic changes in the hormonal milieu occurring during menopause in women, the age-related changes in reproductive hormones of men are subtle and occur gradually throughout the years of mature life. It has been estimated that circulating testosterone (T) declines longitudinally from age 19 at an average rate of 1% per year. The free or dialyzable fraction of serum T and the bioavailable (the sum of free fraction and loosely bound to albumin fraction) T decline more rapidly with age. Although the essential role of androgens in reproductive tissue development and emergence of secondary sex characteristics is well known, their role in adult sexual function seems to be primarily facultative. The effect of T on the central nervous system extends beyond sexual behavior. T has been shown to alter mood, memory, ability to concentrate, and the overall sense of vigor and well being that may interact with a host of other psychologic changes associated with aging. Disordered erectile function is not generally an endocrine problem but rather vascular, neurologic, and psychogenic in origin. It also may be the first sign of systemic vascular disease. The clinical management of andropause requires an individualized approach. In some men, the main problem may be psychologic, whereas in others, hypogonadism may play an important role. Many with erectile failure, suffer silently regardless of its etiology. In this review, we suggest some practical guidelines for the management of these conditions.",

      "abstract": "The majority of children with autism show deviance and socially or psychiatrically handicapping conditions throughout life. Only a small proportion of those with classical childhood autism lead independent adult lives. Others, particularly those with ‘high‐functioning’ autism and so‐called Asperger syndrome will improve enough to live an independent adult life. The level of mental retardation and other comorbid conditions (such as medical syndromes and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy) is important in predicting outcome. An IQ below 50 around school age predicts severe restriction of social and adaptive functioning in adult life. The absence of communicative speech at 5–6 years of age is indicative of a poorer long‐term overall outcome. There is a clear co‐variation between IQ and level of communication, but probably there is some prognostic factor in language development apart from this. Measures of flexibility and cognitive shifting abilities tend to be good predictors of social outcome in a few studies. There is a continued need for prospective, longitudinal studies of children with autism spectrum disorders, particularly in Asperger syndrome. The role of interventions of various kinds needs to be addressed in such studies.",

Despite this, they \nreceive little training in the undergraduate \ncurriculum in the management \nof dementia. Therefore, they \nsometimes face difficulties in the \nmanagement of some patients. Non-pharmacological intervention \nstrategies for dementia in general \npractice are important. Behavioural disturbances such as \ndepression, agitation, aggression, \nwandering about and sleep disturbances \naffect most if not all patients \nat some point in the course of the \ndisease. Empirical data from clinical trials \nindicate that behavioural problems in \ndementia can be effectively managed \nwith non-pharmacological treatment. Family caregivers are often 'hidden \npatients', with health care needs that \nare neglected or ignored because \nthe patient's needs are so overwhelming. Caregivers are at significant risk for \nboth psychiatric and physical morbidity. The majority of the studies report \nimprovements in disruptive behaviours \nas a result of practical, clinical \nand educative interventions which \ncan be undertaken by general practitioners.",

This disorder occurs mostly in males and usually begins in adolescence. The neurobiological etiologies of fetishism remain unclear, and studies on treatment were limited. We present a 14- year-old boy with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with fetishistic behavior who was treated successfully with 36 mg extended-release methylphenidate daily and 4 months of cognitive-rational emotive psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Long before voyeurism became a diagnosis, people peeped. An unanticipated opportunity for King David to peep at Bathsheba led him to a train of Biblical woes and Nathan's rebuke. According to old lore, Tom's peeping at Lady Godiva led God to blind him. The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary. Given, as needed, mild sedatives, certain forms of specific treatment in specific conditions, general measures and good hygiene and sympathetic understanding, the patient may be expected to recover or improve.",

Através de los últimos años se ha comprobado que ciertos individuos son más sensibles a desarrollar una conducta adictiva hacia objetos actividades o personas o un mismo individuo puede desarrollar unas conductas adictivas y a la vez una adicción a drogas. En cambio otras pueden desarrollar con mayor facilidad una conducta adictiva a las actividades, a las máquinas u objetos o a las personas de manera exclusiva, permanente y/o sucesiva, a la cual se le denomina personalidad adictógena. Una de estas patologías es la conducta adictiva al juego llamada también ludopatía y es la que desarrollaremos en este trabajo.

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "Aging is a universal biologic process characterized by a progressive, predictable, inevitable evolution and maturation of an organism until death. The increasing biomedical and psychosocial uniqueness of the elderly requires an individualized approach to their care. The conventional disease-specific approach is not optimal for elderly patients for several reasons. First, people aged 75 years suffer from 3~4 chronic diseases on average. Second, many distressing symptoms or impairments among elderly patients, such as pain, dizziness, fatigue, sleep problems, sensory impairments, and gait disorders cannot be ascribed to a single disease: instead, they result from the accumulated effects of physical, psychological, social, environmental, and other factors. Third, elderly patients vary in the importance they place on potential health outcomes. Three factors at least affect the clinical presentation in elderly patients: underreporting symptoms and impairments, changes in the patterns of presentation of individual illnesses, and an altered spectrum of health conditions. Clinical decision-making is further complicated in these patients because other persons, including the spouse, grown-up children, other relatives, and significant others, are often actively involved, particularly when the patient has cognitive impairment. The physician should understand clinical perspectives of aging and clinically relevant differences between young and old patients, including how elderly individuals behave when they are ill and how to interpret a changing constellation of multiple disease possibilities and interrelationships.",

      "abstract": ". Hypoadrenocorticism (HA), or Addison's disease, is an endocrine disorder uncommon in dogs, primarily occurring between 1 to 6 years of age. It can be classified according to its origin as primary, secondary, or tertiary, with its primary form being the most common. It is caused by idiopathic immune-mediated destruction of the adrenal cortex, which can result in a deficiency of mineralocorticoids and/or glucocorticoids. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific, so patients may exhibit intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as hypotension, tremors, lethargy, anorexia, and weight loss. Diagnosis is made through anamnesis, clinical signs, hematological tests, urinalysis, and abdominal ultrasound. A definitive diagnosis requires the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, in which dogs with HA will show results below the reference range. Treatment should be based on the patient's overall condition and hormonal supplementation, which should be tailored to each dog's specific needs. This study aims to report the case of a 1-year-old Whippet dog admitted to a 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital due to episodes of vomiting and anorexia that evolved into an Addisonian crisis. After the diagnosis of HA and the initiation of treatment with prednisolone and fludrocortisone acetate, the patient was followed-up with for 965 days, during which it experienced episodes of vomiting in stressful situations and had sodium levels at the lower limit in hematological tests.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms in later life",
      "abstract": "Het onderzoek in dit proefschrift is voortgekomen uit ervaringen in de klinische praktijk. Ouderen presenteren zich regelmatig met lichamelijke klachten zonder dat er bij uitvoerig lichamelijk onderzoek lichamelijke oorzaken worden gevonden die deze klachten volledig kunnen verklaren. Ouderen richten zich met deze klachten vaak in eerste instantie tot de huisarts of een somatisch georienteerde specialist. Wanneer deze geen afwijkingen vindt, zijn oudere patienten moeilijk te motiveren psychologische aspecten nader te laten onderzoeken door een psychiater of psycholoog. Patienten ervaren een dergelijke doorverwijzing vaak als een afwijzing. Om dit probleem het hoofd te bieden is er een polikliniek opgericht voor onderzoek en behandeling van Somatisch Onvoldoende verklaarde Lichamelijke Klachten (SOLK) bij ouderen in Nijmegen waar patienten achtereenvolgens worden gezien door klinisch geriater, psychiater en psycholoog. Onze kennis over SOLK is nagenoeg volledig gebaseerd op onderzoek bij jongere volwassenen. Zo weten we dat SOLK bij deze leeftijdsgroep veel voorkomen: tussen 30-50% van de klachten waarvoor patienten hun huisarts bezoeken zijn klachten zonder duidelijke lichamelijke oorzaak. Als de klachten aanhouden en patienten hulp blijven zoeken, kan dat frustraties opleveren voor zowel patienten als hulpverleners. Mensen met SOLK ervaren vaak een hoge lijdensdruk en rapporteren vaak een lage kwaliteit van leven. Tevens is er een hoge co-morbiditeit met depressie en angstproblemen. In hoeverre SOLK voorkomen bij ouderen en hoe dit samenhangt met de kwaliteit van leven voor ouderen is nauwelijks bekend. In hoofdstuk 1 illustreren we drie oudere patienten die de specifieke problemen bij SOLK op latere leeftijd goed weergeven. Vermoedelijk dat juist deze specifieke problemen bijdragen aan de geringe aandacht voor SOLK in deze leeftijdsgroep. Voorbeeld 1 betreft een 75 jarige vrouw met pijn aan haar benen. Diverse medisch specialisten vonden geen oorzaak voor haar klachten; de medische verslaglegging spreekt over “leeftijd gerelateerde klachten” of “slijtage”. De huisarts dacht vervolgens aan een (gemaskeerde) depressie, maar behandeling hierop gericht sloeg niet aan. Hierop werd zij verwezen naar onze polikliniek in verband met onverklaarde pijn aan haar benen. Bij aanvullend onderzoek door de klinisch geriater werd alsnog een lichamelijke oorzaak gevonden, namelijk een vernauwing van haar wervelkanaal. Dit voorbeeld illustreert hoe moeilijk het is om verklaarde en onverklaarde klachten bij ouderen uit elkaar te houden. Met enige regelmaat worden lichamelijke klachten ten onrechte aan normale veroudering toegewezen. Voorbeeld 2 betreft een 75-jarige vrouw met langdurige maag- en darmklachten. Zij is tevens bekend met recidiverende, depressieve stemmingen. Ondanks verschillende behandelingen door zowel een psychiater als door internist en gynaecoloog blijven de klachten bestaan. Op onze polikliniek stellen we een depressieve stoornis vast. Wanneer we deze strak volgens de richtlijnen behandelen verbetert niet alleen haar stemming, maar verdwijnen ook haar de lichamelijke klachten. Dit voorbeeld geeft aan dat depressies en SOLK nauw met elkaar zijn verweven op latere leeftijd en soms moeilijk uit elkaar te houden zijn.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is a major feature of the illness. Like many of the other aspects of the illness, however, it has not been studied extensively in older patients. Several studies of older patients with a lifetime course of poor outcome and chronic institutional stay have indicated that some patients manifest evidence of profound cognitive impairments on a cross-sectional basis and cognitive and functional decline over longitudinal follow-ups of 30 months or longer. Risk factors for this decline include lower educational attainment and more severe positive symptoms, but do not include more severe symptoms of physical illness. These impairments have been shown to be discriminable from normal age-related changes and from the changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In contrast, studies of patients with no history of lifetime institutional stay find no such evidence of either age-related changes in cognitive functioning or longitudinal decline in cognitive or functional status. Since there is accumulating evidence of progressive brain changes over the lifespan in patients with schizophrenia, the course of cognitive deficits in later life will remain an important topic, both for understanding the lifetime course of schizophrenia and for developing interventions aimed at reduction of disability in the illness.",

Over the preceding couple of years his cognitive functions had rapidly declined. As a result, he became dependent on his elderly parents for most of his instrumental activities of daily living including administration of medication, financial management, and driving. He continues to be independent in his personal care. His presentation offered diagnostic challenges due to the interplay of anxiety and cognitive disorders involving both memory and language domains. In addition, he resisted to repeat formal neuropsychological evaluation. At the bedside, his poor effort on testing was often blamed on his severe anxiety confounding the clinical picture. Lack of knowledge of his family history and his childhood development, and unclear premorbid functioning complicated the diagnostic formulation. A differential diagnosis ranging from possible functional cognitive disorder to neurodevelopmental disorder and neurodegenerative disorders will be discussed.",

Indeed, too often healthcare professionals believe that sexual function is not as important as the disease that brought the patient to the rehabilitation team. Neurological disorders frequently alter sexual response by changing the process of sexual stimulation and precluding arousal, decreasing or increasing desire, and curtailing genital engorgement. In these patients, sexual functioning might also be affected by the psychological and behavioral changes associated with neurological disease. Thus, in the neurorehabilitation setting, it is important to question patients about their sexual functioning so that any associated dysfunction can be addressed. A multidisciplinary approach, including psychological counseling, nursing, and medical investigation, is therefore needed to overcome this important and often neglected concern.",

When a person starts using drugs, it starts getting addicted to them and gradually it can’t help but act on the impulse to use them regardless of the damage caused to the body of addicted person. Drug isn’t about just illegal drugs. A person can get addicted to alcohol, painkillers, nicotine and other legal substances. Drug addiction is a deathly disease found in almost every year of age. The disease is mostly carried by people who are mentally frustrated, physically or mentally abused, facing financial problem or family problems and is desperate to get some sort of relief that comes with the high of drugs even if it proves to be grim for their health in the long run. Addiction starts with the continuous use of dosage of any drug, until the point that an individual starts feeling anxious without the availability of them. Slowly and painfully, these drugs starts making a person totally relied on them and it is basically impossible for the individual to survive without them. There can be many reasons as to why an individual decides to go on this path of addiction. Economic problems, state of utter sadness in case of the death of a loved one or a closed one, societal stress, isolation, aggression, bad or wrong company, in state of depression and anxiety are the most likely situations in which a person starts taking drugs. Along with many other factors, families often play a vital role in pushing an individual towards seeking comfort and relief from the drugs. Developing countries like Pakistan and many others are facing the problem as there are not many effective and active rehabilitation centers. In this research article, the role of families contributing in an individual’s drug addiction is elaborated. This research article is done with the help of many researches, as well as some interviews were conducted regarding certain factors and the answers were given according to the observation and views of responders. The conclusion is drawn with the help of articles and personal opinions and observations regarding how a person leans toward substance or drug usage because of certain family issues and problems.",

A psychiatric disorder may significantly complicate diagnostic and therapeutic measures for somatic diseases. The realisation of planned procedures may be delayed or even become impossible in non-compliant subjects. Respect of the patient's will conflicts with the assessment of his/her judgement and protection of his/her supposed interests. Such considerations need an abstraction of the destructive, illness-bound will of these patients in the light of ethical and medical options. The increasing responsibility of physicians in such cases is limited by an often controversial legal frame. We present such practice-relevant problems which we encountered in the treatment of an 83-year-old woman with cholestatic jaundice of clinically unknown origin and chronic schizophrenia.",

However, it is perhaps particularly significant in the psychotherapy of anorexia nervosa. I hope to show that the notion of absence can help to draw together some of the many strands which go to make up this most complex of conditions. Recognition of what is absent can help illuminate the patient's unconscious conflicts and point to the capacities that she has been unable to develop. These absences arise out of early environmental deficiencies, such as a lack of containment, which can result in failures of introjection and an absence of the potential space. They can leave the child ill equipped to experience, understand or deal with her feelings, develop a secure sense of self or think symbolically. Sexual desire, aggression and envy often appear to be absent from the conscious world of the anorexic. In therapy, there is often a striking absence of feeling and of connection between patient and therapist. The work is done largely in relation to what is not talked about, felt or understood and what is apparently not happening. The therapist needs to create a space in which absence and emptiness can be thought about and symbolized, and a sense of self can begin to develop.",

The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Article Abstract A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is difficult to make when a depressed patient can provide no evidence of having experienced mania or hypomania, either because the elevated mood states are not recognized as periods of illness or because depression is the initial episode and the patient has yet to experience the other polarity of the disorder. In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

Unusual patterns of care experienced by some children and the inappropriate illness behaviours of those with particular influence over them play a central part in the development of the most extreme disorders. Prospective studies are limited but indicate that patterns of illness behaviour in childhood are often persistent and continue or recur in adult life. Inappropriate patterns of invalidism are common in children and adults and the poor prognosis, considerable costs and personal distress indicate the need for primary prevention as well as more active intervention for those who are at particular risk.",

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

On the basis of literature of a very general nature the author distinguishes between a difficult personal situation, a symptom, an illness, functional limitations and invalidity, the last one being at the crossroads between medical, personal and social reasons.

      "title": "Evaluation and Comparison of the Effects of Time Perspective Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Narrative Therapy on Severity of Symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common disorder and due to its debilitating nature, it causes serious problems for the patient, and his/her family. Some of its repercussions are loss of self-confidence, disappointment, reduction in educational and professional performance, personal failure in social relationships. According to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), OCD is classified as a separate class of psychological disorders; while it has been classified under anxiety disorders in the DSM-IV. According to DSM-5, observance of both or each one of obsession and compulsion symptoms is enough to diagnose OCD. Obsession refers to an uncontrollable frequent mental image, thought, unwanted desire that cause uncomfortable condition to the patients. The patient is not able to stop thoughts such as fear of air pollution, harming others or oneself, and expression of natural/sexual immoral desires. OCD is the fourth most common psychological disorder and is also a clinical challenge. In recent years, several medical and psychological treatments have been conducted to treat the disorder (Sadok & Sadok, 2007). Behavioral approach and other effective ways to encounter and prevent OCD responses are the first treatment options that help controlling the symptoms to a great extent. Nevertheless, the notable achievement regarding treatment of the disorder is undeniable, there are still cases that have no or negligible response to the treatment. However, there are patients who cannot approbate encountering methods and don't execute homework or the tasks (Sookman & Steketee, 2010). Although CBT is successful in treating OCD, many researches have been conducted to find out other methods with more efficiency (Rees & Vankoesveld, 2008). One of these approaches is time perspective therapy, that is rooted in social psychology and it is extending to clinical and psychological fields. It has to do with the way that people connect their behavior with the past, present and future and at the same time mirroring viewpoints, beliefs, and values pertinent to time. It also takes time as a quasi-trait structure constituted of several aspects including past positive, past negative, present fatalist, and present hedonist, and the future. Time perspective therapy (TPT) is a novel treatment method based on time perspective theory (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). In general, psychological engagement with any time frames or loss of attention to a time framework appears to have to do with abnormal performance. As the theory implies, over past negative orientation, psychological engagement with negative experience, present fatalist orientation, or future negative are the strong indicators of psychological problems (Beek, Berghuis, Kerkhof & Beekman, 2011). Boyd and Zimbardo (2005) made it clear that treatment or a healthy psychological performance is achieved by maintaining balance between the past, present, and the future. This balance might be a reflection of an individual's capabilities to learn from the past, compatibility with the present, and preparing to encounter with orientated behaviors for the future. There is a pool of information of using time perspective theory in many heath facilities; while there is paucity of clinical psychology and psychotherapy studies. The first work on the role of time perspective on committing suicide was carried out by Laghi, Baiocco, D'Alessio & Gurrieri (2009). Beek, Berghuis, Kerkhof and Beekman (2011) examined the relationship between time perspective, personality, and psychological pathology and concluded that subjects with higher past negative scores were more vulnerable to stress and psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. In addition, they found a relationship between lack of orientation to future in time perspective and depression/suicide thoughts. Furthermore, positive relationship was found between neurosis and past negative perspective. Zimbardo, Sword and Sword (2012) codified a 6-session treatment protocol based on TPT to reduce PTSD symptoms. …",

Adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and the demoralization syndrome represent common disorders and phenomena among patients with advanced cancer. Moreover, uncontrollable pain and high unrelieved physical symptom burden, depression, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, delirium, and low family support are major factors in the desire for thoughts of suicide and the desire for hastened death. Caregivers play an important and challenging role, providing emotional and social support for the patient, helping with medical needs, and meeting increasingly complex instrumental needs such as running the household and work.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "abstract": "The ability to experience pleasurable sexual activity is important for human health. Receptive anal intercourse (RAI) is a common, though frequently stigmatized, pleasurable sexual activity. Little is known about how diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus and their treatments affect RAI. Engaging in RAI with gastrointestinal disease can be difficult due to the unpredictability of symptoms and treatment-related toxic effects. Patients might experience sphincter hypertonicity, gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety, altered pelvic blood flow from structural disorders, decreased sensation from cancer-directed therapies or body image issues from stoma creation. These can result in problematic RAI — encompassing anodyspareunia (painful RAI), arousal dysfunction, orgasm dysfunction and decreased sexual desire. Therapeutic strategies for problematic RAI in patients living with gastrointestinal diseases and/or treatment-related dysfunction include pelvic floor muscle strengthening and stretching, psychological interventions, and restorative devices. Providing health-care professionals with a framework to discuss pleasurable RAI and diagnose problematic RAI can help improve patient outcomes. Normalizing RAI, affirming pleasure from RAI and acknowledging that the gastrointestinal system is involved in sexual pleasure, sexual function and sexual health will help transform the scientific paradigm of sexual health to one that is more just and equitable. Receptive anal intercourse (RAI) is an important consideration in gastrointestinal disorders and cancers. This Review discusses the anorectum as a sexual organ, providing an overview of pleasurable and problematic RAI and how gastrointestinal disease itself and associated treatments (such as surgery) can affect RAI. Strategies to manage problematic RAI to improve sexual health are also described.",

      "title": "Lower urinary tract disease: what are we trying to treat and in whom?",
      "abstract": "The diseases of the lower urinary tract are traditionally divided into abnormalities of storage and abnormalities of emptying. The targets for therapy were the organs most responsible for influencing storage and emptying. Modern understanding places the symptomatic status of the patient as the overriding criterion for treatment. It also accommodates a broader understanding of multiple and overlapping systems. Symptoms of voiding dysfunction have been clearly shown to be associated with symptoms of other genitourinary disease, for example, erectile dysfunction (ED). Treatment of voiding dysfunction has also been shown to have effects (adverse or beneficial) in these other domains. Thus, the symptoms of lower urinary tract disease (LUTD) that have to be considered now as targets relevant to these therapies include ED, ejaculatory dysfunction, sexual desire, sexual pain disorders and female sexual dysfunction. The anatomic, neural and endocrine systems that support these symptomatic functions and dysfunctions span the range from the urogenital smooth muscle to the hypothalamus, the bladder sensory output to the micturition centre and growth factors to androgens. Potentially important targets also include vascular and spinal structures, sex hormones and nitric oxide as well as the obvious genes, enzymes and receptors. The epidemiological studies prove the convergence of LUTD when viewed through the lens of the current patient-related outcomes and problem constructs. This convergence serves as a clear guidance to include wide ranging outcome instruments in all future studies with compounds being investigated for the treatment of LUTD. Out of these will come evidence of expected and unexpected collateral effects. The convergence should open the possibility to a different business model for developing therapeutic concepts. The blockbuster drug for a monolithic indication may be supplemented by agents with single or multiple pathway activity with smaller parallel targets. Using an approach based on patient reported outcomes to therapeutic targets not only widens the range of conditions, but also the patient types who can be considered as having LUTD.

      "abstract": "Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep-wake disorder, affects 6% to 10% of adults. It may result in interpersonal and occupational problems and has a deleterious effect on quality of life. Patients may experience difficulty with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, or both. Insomnia disorder is commonly comorbid with psychiatric, medical, and neurologic disorders, and insomnia and comorbid conditions have bidirectional relationships. Diagnosis should be based on patient interview, assessment with tools, and use of criteria. Selection of treatment for patients with insomnia should factor in efficacy for the patient's specific complaint as well as other features such as safety profile and abuse liability. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is a first-line recommendation by guidelines, but some patients are unable or unwilling to try it or may not respond to it. Older adults with insomnia disorder require careful consideration of medications' risk-benefit profiles.",

Chronic pain is longer and presents either with a current physical source or after its apparent healing. Chronic pain perception involves fewer physical factors and more subjective factors. Recurrent pain syndromes, commonly headache and abdominal and limb pains, are painful and without apparent physical cause; however, they do not always imply a psychological disorder.",

Normal development involves the early establishment of a secure attached relationship. From this solid base, the child can develop a sense of self whilst psychologically separating and individuating. Problems developing a secure attachment, or with separation and individuation, can lead to insecure ambivalent attachments and problems with development of identity and sense of self. If these problems progress into adulthood, there will be a poor sense of self, poorly formed identity and associated problems with self-esteem. Relationships may be associated with avoidance, intense ambivalence, or with loss of identity and individuality.",

In managing such problems a thorough psychosexual assessment is required in order to ascertain the exact nature of the problem and what the precipitating, predisposing and prolonging factors are. In disorders of orientation and disorders involving aberrant sexual behaviours, the developmental history and early childhood relationships must be looked into carefully. Laboratory investigations are usually indicated in erectile dysfunction as up to 80% would have an organic aetiology--vascular, neurological and endocrine disorders have to be ruled out. Treatment of the various conditions involves general sexual counselling, behaviour therapy including stress management, psychotherapy, marital therapy and drug therapy as indicated. However, in erectile dysfunction, drug treatment (including intracavernosal injections), mechanical aids, or surgery may be indicated; and in transsexualism--for those who are unable to revert to accepting their natural status--a sex reassignment operation is the treatment of choice.",

Depressed or anxious alcohol-dependent people often believe that they drink to relieve symptoms of sadness or nervousness. However, research does not unanimously support the prior existence of severe depressive or anxiety disorders as a usual cause of alcoholism. A review of recent literature (from family studies, prospective investigations, and studies of children of alcoholics) on the complex interaction between alcohol dependence and independent anxiety/depressive disorders reveals that if an association between alcoholism and anxiety/depressive disorders does exist, it likely operates in a relatively small subgroup of alcoholics at the same time. Psychological symptoms may carry a worse prognosis for alcohol-related problems, and these symptoms must be addressed early in alcoholism treatment.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

      "title": "Locus of Control, Social Support and Alcoholism",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlcohol dependence is a chronic, recurrent illness of progressive course which, if not treated, has a predictably negative outcome. It is characterized by numerous cognitive, behavioural and physiological symptoms as well as a person's tendency to consume alcohol even when significant alcohol consumption related problems have occurred.1 There are many factors influencing the development of alcohol related disorders and the disorder itself leads to problems in different areas of an individual's functioning. Alcoholics have a specific lifestyle and specific habits, they experience problems in their professional lives, communication and relationships with their families and friends, they lose motivation and willingness to pursue the existing interests, self confidence and self esteem are worsening, it is becoming more and more difficult to meet the demands of their environment to the degree that they are completely unable to meet those requirements and therefore they reject them.This is why it is necessary to examine different demographic characteristics of individual, concrete problems, co morbid psychiatric disorders, existence of addictions in a family, cognitive functioning. It seems that, for the treatment, it is particularly important to recognize the availability of social support and the degree of insight into the problem, motivation to change the behaviour, perception of personal competence, locus of control.Locus of control refers to the perceived place, in other words, location of doers who/which the person perceives as a source of control of their own behaviour and the cause of everything that happens to them.8 Internally oriented individuals attribute the results of their behaviour to their own actions, abilities, efforts or any other characteristics. At the other end of the continuum there are individuals with external locus of control and therefore they attribute control over the outcomes of their behaviour to powers outside themselves, such as luck, chance or more powerful others. An individual who believes that he is responsible for his alcohol related problems and that successful abstinence depends only on their decision to stop drinking, has an internal locus of control over consumption of alcohol, while an individual with external alcohol consumption locus of control attributes his problems with alcohol and treatment outcomes to external powers.3 The research by Mariano and oth.3 showed that alcohol related internal locus of control is in a positive relation with motivation to change, involvement in treatment and abstinence duration.However, the things a person experiences and the basis for their choice of behaviour is not only under the influence of their inner man but also of their environment. Numerous studies have proved social support to be an important guideline in main- taining of alcohol and drug abstinence.2-6 In addition, decreasing stress perception in a specific situation and effective use of strategies to face the stress is a mechanism by which social support influences the maintenance of abstinence.2Objective of this research was to: examine correlation between person's characteristics (alcohol consumption locus of control) and social support (support from family and support from friends), and abstinence duration and examine contribution of personality and social support in explaining abstinence duration.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODSParticipantsThe research included 60 men aged 26-74 (X=47,64; SD=9,76), diagnosed with chronic alcoholism and treated in Psychiatric clinic, Clinical Hospital Center in Osijek, and members of Alcoholic Anonymous in Osijek, Valpovo and Dakovo. Graphs 1 and 2 show structure of participants based on kind of consumed alcohol consumed consumed and co morbidity. Most of the participants have secondary school degree and are retired. Participants most commonly consume beer, most of them have no co morbidity and among those who have, the most common are posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. …",

      "abstract": "Episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik merupakan bentuk dari depresi berat yang disertai gejala psikotik yang khas seperti waham atau delusi non-bizarre nihilistik, somatik, kemiskinan, ketidakberhargaan, atau adanya keyakinan-keyakinan delusional tentang perasaan bersalah dan sedang dihukum, serta kadang-kadang muncul halusinasi. Keyakinan-keyakinan delusional pada penderita episode depresif dengan gejala psikotik merupakan suatu distorsi kognitif, sebuah pola berpikir yang rancu dan menimbulkan kesalahan secara negatif yang meningkatkan kerentanan terhadap depresi. Studi kasus ini mengkaji klien yang didiagnosis episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik dari sudut pandang psikologi dengan pendekatan Teori Kognitif Beck. Seorang laki-laki bernama G, berusia 45 tahun mengurung diri dan tidak mau bertemu dengan saudara-saudaranya. Klien tidak mau mandi serta tidak shalat. Klien merasa ia tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagi. Menurut kakak, adik ipar, dan istri klien, klien pernah mengalami kecelakaan ketika bekerja di pabrik dan saat mengendarai sepeda motor sehingga kondisi fisiknya menurun. Klien lalu mendapatkan pemutusan hubungan kerja. Kondisi kejiwaannya terganggu. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menunjukkan bahwa klien memiliki depresi dan kecemasan berlebihan. Teori kognitif Beck mengenai depresi mencantumkan tiga aktivitas kognitif yang mendasari munculnya sebuah gangguan, yaitu: a) negative triad (pandangan pesimistik terhadap diri sendiri, dunia, dan masa depan); b) skema atau keyakinan negatif yang dipicu oleh peristiwa/ situasi kehidupan negatif; dan c) distorsi kognitif. Negative triad berupa pandangan klien bahwa ia telah gagal, sedang dihukum, dan tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa di masa depan. Skema atau keyakinan negatif klien, yaitu meyakini bahwa karena sakitnya yang dialaminya tersebut membuatnya tidak berdaya. Distorsi Kognitif dalam bentuk overgeneralisasi, yaitu â€œSaya tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagiâ€. Â  Kata Kunci: depresi, gejala psikotik, keyakinan delusional, Teori Kognitif Beck, negative triad Â  Severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a form of major depression accompanied by typical psychotic symptoms such as delusions or nihilistic, non-bizarre delusions, somatic, poverty, worthlessness, or delusional beliefs about guilt and being punished, and sometimes appear hallucination. Delusional beliefs in people with depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a cognitive distortion, a pattern of thinking that is ambiguous and negatively causes errors that increase susceptibility to depression. This case study discusses clients diagnosed with severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms from a psychological perspective with Beckâ€™s Cognitive Theory approach. A 45-year-old man named G locked himself in and didn't want to see his brothers and sisters. Clients did not want to shower and did not pray. The client feels he could not do anything According to the brother, sister-in-law, and client's wife, the client had an accident while working in a factory and while riding a motorcycle so that his physical condition declined. The client then gets terminated in work. His mental condition is disturbed. The results of the integration of psychological tests show that the client has depression and excessive anxiety. Beck's cognitive theory of depression lists three cognitive activities that underlie the emergence of a disorder, namely: a) negative triads (pessimistic views of yourself, the world, and the future); b) negative schemes or beliefs triggered by negative life events/ situations; and c) cognitive distortion. Negative triad is the client's view that he has failed, is being punished, and cannot do anything in the future. The client's negative schema or belief, which is to believe that because of the pain he is experiencing makes him helpless. Cognitive Distortion in the form of overgeneralization, which is I can't do anything else.

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, affective/emotional disorders and exposure to adverse life circumstances are the main sources of psychological impairment in school age children. They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

A false-positive finding would be clarified as such rather rapidly, most likely in a first medical interview, without any serious financial, psychological, or social consequences ensuing. In fact, the contrary might occur. Persons scoring as a false-positive may do so because of social, psychological, or medical problems, eg, depression, that may well benefit from medical attention.

There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders.

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

      "abstract": "Madness has traditionally been seen as an illness of the mind, or even, more romantically, sickness of the soul. Contemporary biomedical approach views it as a brain disease caused by chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters. Its symptoms are also associated with mental activity such as perceptions, cognition, emotions and moods. Nevertheless, much of the impact of the so-called mental illness is voiced through the body. First of all, mental distress is often communicated in a myriad of bodily pains. Most common psychosomatic complaints include dizziness, headaches, backaches, skin problems, indigestion and fatigue. Then, many mentally ill have problems accepting and respecting their body functions, especially problematic are sexual needs, menstruation and eating. It is manifested either in fear of sexuality or, its opposite, compulsive promiscuity. A similar black-and- white attitude concerns food, which is either completely denied to the body in anorexia or abused in bulimic binging. The 'sick' attitude to the body parodies the paradoxes innate in Western culture, which splits the human being into binary opposites of flesh and soul. The aim of my chapter is to look at bodily manifestations of mental illness as recorded in women's madness narratives. I analyse the body image presented in them as well as the body-mind dichotomy the authors often experience. The texts I focus on include Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, Marya Hornbacher's Wasted and Kate Grenville's Lilian's Story.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the analysis of the phenomenon of procrastination in the historical context. The peculiarities of defining this concept in the works of Ukrainian and foreign researchers are considered. Different definitions of the phenomenon of procrastination are analyzed and it is established that there is no single approach to its definition. However, it was found that procrastination has always been characterized by two aspects: voluntary postponement of intention and the presence of psychological discomfort associated with postponement of such intention. The analysis of the reasons of its occurrence is carried out; it was found that there is no consensus on the factors that cause and / or exacerbate procrastination. The characteristic features of this phenomenon and features of manifestation are investigated. The main approaches to the study of procrastination are analyzed: psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, subjective, motivational, psychophysiological. Possible negative consequences for the personality are revealed, among which are anxiety, stress, loss of productivity, psychosomatic disorders. The main types of procrastination are considered. It was found that some of the most common reasons for procrastination are: the difficulty of the task, fear of failure and success, perfectionism, insecurity, inability to plan and organize their activities, improper motivation, impulsiveness and others. It has been established that procrastination is a complex, heterogeneous phenomenon that includes a number of components and extends to various spheres of human life. The relationship between the concepts of procrastination and laziness is analyzed. It is established that they are based on various psychological mechanisms. Prospects for further research are identified.",

It is often accompanied by a peculiar sense of discomfort, a desire to rest, and reduced motivation, referred to as fatigue sensation. Acute fatigue is a normal condition or phenomenon that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue, lasting at least 6 months, does not disappear after ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs activities and contributes to various medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, epileptic seizures, and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. For example, in Japan, more than one third of the general adult population complains of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it. Here, we review data primarily from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to neural dysfunction as well as autonomic nervous system, sleep, and circadian rhythm disorders in fatigue. These data provide new perspectives on the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and on overcoming it.",

      "title": "Interstitial Cystitis Self-Management",
      "abstract": "The self-management strategies that interstitial cystitis (IC) sufferers use to promote physical, social and emotional well-being are poorly understood. Their lives can be fractured because symptoms, such as urinary frequency and urgency and unrelenting pelvic pain, do not necessarily respond well to currently offered allopathic medical treatments. IC is a chronic disease of hard to predict exacerbations and remissions.Fundamentally, IC’s most debilitating symptom is chronic pain. Sufferers repeatedly contact practitioners in the hope of determining the cause of the pain. At present, practitioners can only offer ‘stopgap’ measures for IC symptoms because of an inability to identify its cause or resolve its symptoms. With few precise signs and symptoms, practitioners can sometimes question the validity of the sufferers’ complaints, leading to inadequate diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, the degree of stress sufferers’ experience, the impact of IC on their sexual function and relationships with their partners and the long-term impact of IC on their lives remains undetermined.",

      "title": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the Treatment of Sleep Disorders: Theoretical Foundations, Research Methods and Analysis of Effectiveness",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are not just a disruption of a person’s normal recovery process and a deterioration in life quality. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that insomnia is an independent factor that worsens the course of somatic diseases and leads to psycho-emotional disorders of varying severity. Research into cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia aims to provide answers to these questions. The most effective non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia are behavioural and psychotherapeutic methods that improve sleep and do not cause side effects or addiction. The chosen research topic is also relevant in the context of the increasing prevalence of insomnia due to the profound shocks of the Russian-Ukrainian war among internally displaced persons, various other stresses and interpersonal conflicts. All these and many other factors can cause acute insomnia. Patients with insomnia often have increased emotional reactivity, which can also lead to disorders. The findings of the research help understand the psychological factors involved in the processes of researching cognitive behavioural therapy for sleep disorders and can be used by practitioners who are faced with the need to treat patients with insomnia; it will help to understand traumatic experiences and emotional needs better. In conclusion, cognitive behavioural therapy is a practical, non-pharmacological approach to the treatment of sleep disorders, including insomnia. The study highlights the importance of addressing psychological factors, such as emotional reactivity and traumatic experiences, which are often associated with insomnia. As well as providing valuable information for practitioners, this study highlights the importance of individualised therapeutic interventions, particularly in high-stress environments such as those resulting from war and displacement. cuments in various Scopus indexed journals was examined bibliometrically, for the years 2014-2024.",

The benefits of being fit touch every part of our lives—our overall energy level, sleep patterns, psychological and emotional well-being, and relationships. Except when you are experiencing severe or sharp joint pain and noticeable swelling, exercise should be a regular part of your day. The latest research shows that physical conditioning exercise can improve your fitness level without aggravating your RA or causing a flare of symptoms. So whether you have mild, moderate, or severe disease, exercise is an important part of your plan. However, it is important to understand that the type and intensity of exercise may need to be regulated, depending on your disease activity.",

      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of a severe mental illness and a substance use or abuse disorder is common in the United States as well as internationally and could be considered as more the expectation than the exception when assessing patients with serious mental illness. Substance use disorders can occur at any phase of the mental illness, perhaps even inducing psychosis. Causes of this comorbidity may include self-medication, genetic vulnerability, environment or lifestyle, underlying shared origins, and/or a common neural substrate. The consequences of dual diagnosis include poor medication compliance, physical comorbidities and poor health, poor self-care, increased suicide risk or aggression, increased sexual behavior, and possible incarceration. All of these factors contribute to a greater health burden, which reduces the health care system's capacity to adequately treat patients. Therefore, screening, assessment, and integrated treatment plans for dual diagnosis that can address both the addiction disorder and the mental illness are recommended in order to provide accurate treatment, after-care, and other health care to accommodate patients' social and vocational needs.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of major depressive episode in the elderly leads to impairment on several aspects of daily life, including life quality, morbid - mortality and increases rates of suicide risks. Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

In Norway it is estimated that between 600 and 800 people are affected every year.The Directorate of Health asked the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Division for Health Services to search for, identify and summarize research on the effect of physical activity without the use of antipsychotics compared to physical activity where the patient with active psychosis is receiving antipsychotics related to the outcomes; symptoms, death and serious events, physical function, social functioning, quality of life, the use of medication or healthcare.We conducted a systematic search for controlled studies in six databases.We found no relevant studies, therefore we do not know whether physical activity with or physical activity without antipsychotics is most effective.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders can be broadly classified into: (a) insomnia, (b) parasomnia, (c) sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurologic and other medical disorders, and (d) proposed sleep disorders (e.g. pregnancy and menstrual related sleep disorders).1 Insomnia is a common encounter in primary care consultations2 and constitutes the commonest sleep problem3,4 that presents to the general practitioner. Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

O rim pode perder suas capacidades funcionais, sem causar maiores danos ao paciente. Entretanto, quando a perda e maior do que 75% comecam a surgir problemas de saude, devido as alteracoes funcionais graves e progressivas. Pacientes portadores de insuficiencia renal cronica tem, geralmente, sido submetidos a dois tipos de tratamento: a dialise peritoneal e a hemodialise. O numero de pacientes que sao submetidos a dialise peritoneal e da ordem de 2% a 5% dos renais cronicos e o restante desta percentagem sao submetidos a hemodialise. Todo paciente cronico apresenta algum tipo de comprometimento emocional, podendo afetar diversos aspectos da vida do individuo, tais como: relacionamentos, autoestima, qualidade de vida e esperancas de sobrevivencia. Com o problema renal, ainda podem ocorrer alteracoes psicologicas, emocionais e intelectuais. Esse trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar o nivel de estresse em renais cronicos que eram submetidos a hemodialise e verificar se a intervencao de relaxamento fisiologico poderia reduzir os niveis de estresse. A pesquisa foi realizada apos ter sido aprovada pelo Comite de Etica da UniFil, com criterios de inclusao e exclusao. Foi aplicado um questionario com perguntas fechadas, avaliacao de nivel de estresse e avaliacao de experiencias recentes. Foram selecionados dois grupos para pesquisa, um de controle e outro de intervencao,nos quais os escolhidos eram pacientes renais cronicos com diagnostico ha mais de tres anos, realizavam hemodialise de duas a tres vezes por semana e com idade superior a vinte anos. Apos essa selecao, foi aplicado o inventario de sintomas de estresse para adultos de Lipp (ISSL), para verificar se o relaxamento progressivo de Jacobson produziria a reducao de estresse nesta populacao. Verificou-se que os sintomas do nivel de estresse diminuiram e que alguns pacientes passaram da fase de exaustao para a fase de resistencia. A predominância do estresse antes psicologico passou para fisico/psicologico. Acredita-se que essas mudancas ocorreram devido a intervencao atraves do relaxamento aplicado. Diante dos resultados significativos com relacao ao estresse, sugere-se uma intervencao terapeutica visando a reducao de estresse com os renais cronicos, no qual se obteve grande exito na pesquisa realizada.",

High-intensity treatment regimens often used in the treatment of patients with inhibitors also impose significant scheduling, economic, and emotional demands on patients and their families or primary caregivers. A comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment of the physical, emotional, and social status of adult hemophilia patients with inhibitors is essential for the development of treatment strategies that can be individualized to address the complex needs of these patients.

      "title": "Diagnostic guidelines for bipolar depression: a probabilistic approach",
      "abstract": "Objectives: There are currently no accepted diagnostic criteria for bipolar depression for either research or clinical purposes. This paper aimed to develop recommendations for diagnostic criteria for bipolar I depression. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and Medline were undertaken. Results: There are no pathognomonic characteristics of bipolar I depression compared to unipolar depressive disorder. There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

One of their principal characteristics is that they frequently develop within complex contexts where physical and psychiatric co-morbidity is frequently encountered and where interpersonal, social, environmental and economic factors are much in evidence. While a clinical approach reveals signs and symptoms allowing us to arrive at a diagnosis, an in-depth analysis reveals the extent to which a particular patient's situation is unique, defined as it is by a multiplicity of parameters. A therapeutic approach must take this data into account.",

      "title": "Cancer-Related Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue (CrF) is a common condition affecting up to 40% of cancer patients. It is characterized by a persistent or relapsing exhaustion that lasts for more than 6 months and does not improve with sleep or rest. CrF can be classified in mild, moderate or severe, depending on the degree of impairment. Although improvement is possible, many patients suffer from long-term illness and disability that significantly impair quality of life. Multiple factors may contribute to the development of CrF including cancer itself, cancer treatment, comorbidities and medications as well as genetic factors. The diagnosis of CrF is based on a detailed medical history and should be supported by specific questionnaires for the assessment of the extent of fatigue. Treatable contributing factors (e.g. cardiac, renal, pulmonary or endocrine dysfunctions as well as anaemia, arthritis or neuromuscular diseases) should be excluded. Treatment for CrF aims to reduce the symptoms and includes physical exercises, psychosocial interventions (behavioural and/or (psycho)educational therapy) and complemental interventions. The role of pharmacologic interventions in the therapy of CrF still needs to be evaluated. Although CrF may persist after cancer treatment, full recovery is possible and has been demonstrated particularly in children and young adults.",

Psychiatric disturbances usually take the form of euphoria or elation in mood. Depression is less likely, and irritability or aggressiveness may occur. In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959). Disturbances may appear within six to seven hours of initial therapy (Goolker and Schein, 1953), after prolonged administration, or even after complete withdrawal of the hormone therapy.",

U klinickoj slici u starijih osoba u odnosu na mlađe cesce su prisutni: agitacija, psihomotorna retardacija, hipohondrijaza/somatizacije, histrionsko ponasanje, bitno smanjenje unosa hrane i tekucine te pseudodemencija. Dijagnosticki postupci obuhvacaju obavezno uz anamnezu i heteroanamnezu, MMSE, tjelesni pregled, EKG, laboratorijske pretrage + dodatne dijagnosticke pretrage - određivanje vitamina BI 2, folne kiseline, Fe, hormona stitnjace, EEG te CT/MR mozga. Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe. Prikaz slucaja: Bolesnica u dobi 76 godina, lijecena u sedam navrata u KB Vrapce pod dijagnozama granicnog poremecaja licnosti, vaskularnedemencijenakonpreboljelog CVI-a i vaskularne depresije. Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

Alcohol seems be even the higher risk for soldiers less exposed to combat stressors (e.g. fire), but more to chronic stressors (boredom, isolation, helplessness) than PTSD for a soldier in action.

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that can result from experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of PTSD on sexual disorders. Results showed that sexual dysfunction is a common problem experienced by individuals with PTSD, and it can include a range of issues such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty achieving orgasm. The effects of PTSD on sexual function can be complex and multifactorial. Some studies suggest that trauma’s psychological and emotional impact can lead to changes in sexual desire, arousal, and response. Additionally, individuals with PTSD may experience physical symptoms such as pain or discomfort during sexual activity. Treatment for PTSD, including prolonged exposure therapy and present-centred therapy, may improve sexual function in some individuals. However, the relationship between PTSD and sexual dysfunction is still not well understood, and more research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this association and to develop effective treatments. In summary, sexual dysfunction is a common problem among individuals with PTSD. The complex interplay between psychological and physical factors can make treatment challenging, but a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the psychological and physical aspects of sexual dysfunction may be effective in improving the quality of life for those with PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Non-organic voice disorders are characterised by an impaired voice sound, and/or reduced vocal capacity, and/or laryngeal sensory disturbances, all in the absence of causal organic laryngeal pathology. Psychogenic causes, a \"psychological disequilibrium\", and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder. In making a diagnosis, perceptive and acoustic methods for voice analysis are used in addition to the ENT-examination and the laryngostroboscopy. An assessment of the degree to which the patient feels him/herself subjectively affected by the voice disorder also plays an important role. If the history reveals any indication of psychosocial stress or conflict, the patient is offered psychological consultations. These conflicts seem less often to be deep rooted psychopathological problems but rather daily anxieties, failures, injuries, annoyances, disappointments regarding the sufferer him/herself and others, the non-fulfillment of desires, feelings of inadequacy and of lack of self-confidence. The patients may find it difficult to speak about conflicts and feelings, and they follow social conventions to an excessive extent. In frustrating situations patients tend to react aggressively towards themselves rather than towards others and are too quick in seeking a solution to any problem that may arise. The role of the voice as a \"barometer of emotion\", where a disorder may be regarded as a sign of emotional stress, has to be taken into consideration before starting a therapy: If the non-organic voice disorder is obviously due to vocal misuse and muscle tension, a more symptom-orientated voice therapy may be favoured. If psychosocial stress seems to play a greater role, additional counseling may be necessary. Only by using this approach can the patient be offered a therapy which goes into the causes and thereby addresses the whole person.",

Alcohol may have significance as a risk factor for the perpetrator (culprit, car driver, etc.), as well as for the victim. This is especially clear in cases of violence and assault. Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose‐response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo‐graphic factors must be taken into account. The populations studied are often selected, e.g., from emergency departments, pathology units (postmortem data), or related to those epidemiological studies based on interviews.

      "abstract": "Rehabilitation in psychiatry is still associated with a more complete reestablishing of chronic patients' position in the society. However, early rehabilitation does not seem to resolve all the problems. Social losses and social deterioration are found in more than half of schizophrenic patients already in prodrome phase i.e. before the onset of the first psychotic episode. Further on, every relapse, several months of disease and hospitalizations frequently disrupt education, cause losing jobs and breaking relations, social withdrawal and also disability. Environmental and social factors may facilitate the development of chronic conditions and increasing defect via their interaction with the personality and the disease. Not infrequently the rehabilitation process may lag behind and certain possibilities may be missed. There is also a gap between the rehabilitation concepts and sociopsychological characteristics of specific age groups of psychiatric patients. The author presents the concept of psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) using schizophrenic patients as an example and emphasizes the following aspects: 1) PSR in an essential component of care on every stage that follows treatment, throughout the whole course of disease; 2) psychosocial interventions and social support are aimed at both preserving social capacities of the patient and prevention of social losses in future; 3) complex therapy in combination with consequent psychosocial (both group and individual) patient-centered interventions involving also family and social network of the patient is used along with other methods of social recovery; 4) with regard for the mentioned one can distinguish the most problematic patients groups, specifically: a) those in initial phase of disease (first 5 years), b) patients with frequent hospitalizations, c) those with unstable labor adjustment, d) single persons, e) those staying in hospital too long; and 5) in adolescence and in young age the purpose of rehabilitation is not only winning back the social positions but also restoration of the patient's personality and his social self; while in older age coping with negative effects of getting older and acceptation of new social roles are becoming more important.",

When disruptions to the SCN’s perceptual system occur (e.g., “jet-lag,” prolonged waking, chronic exposure to light at night or habit change as the result of becoming a parent), disrupted melatonin and glucocorticoid secretion can lead to widespread dysregulation of sleep and circadian cycling. The effects of circadian disruptions are often compounded by the homeostatic sleep drive, wherein sleep pressure accumulates with protracted wakefulness to affect mood, cognition, health and well-being.",

Although the Centers for Disease Control definition of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) excludes pre-existing psychiatric illness, common psychosocial problems short of a clinical disorder (such as irritability, difficulty in thinking, inability to concentrate, depression and sleep disturbance) overlap with the criteria for CFS. Psychological states can affect the course of CFS or become confused in the patient's and doctor's mind with the course of infection. The core dilemma in practice is how aggressively to pursue a possible basis for CFS when it persists in the absence of an identifiable external cause. Possibilities for exploration are numerous and potentially expensive. In practice, the persistence of doctors depends on the patient's illness behaviour, on financial and organizational factors, and on the culture of medical care and practice styles. It is essential to differentiate the appropriate management of CFS from scientific study where intensive investigation may be warranted. In practice doctors should proceed in a manner that conveys concern, supports function, and avoids dysfunctional illness behaviour and inadvertent legitimization and reinforcement of disability.",

We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "abstract": "The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of mental and physical symptoms arising in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms disappear after the onset of menstruation. During the rest of the follicular phase the patient is free from symptoms. The cyclical nature of the symptom variations is characteristic of the syndrome. The lack of a commonly accepted definition and a way to diagnose PMS has led to contradictory results in the search for its aetiology and treatment. The diagnosis of PMS should be based on prospective daily ratings of symptoms and defined criteria of subgroups. In our studies three subgroups can be identified. The \"Pure PMS\" group with significant cyclical symptoms being worse during the luteal phase and no symptoms during the follicular phase. A \"Premenstrual aggravation\" group with symptoms always present but with an aggravation premenstrually. A \"Non-PMS\" group of women who do not suffer from menstrual cycle related symptoms. These three groups show significant differences in the number of patients with an earlier psychiatric history and are different in the extent of neurosis on a personality test. The Pure PMS group had less neurosis and a lower frequency of patients with an earlier psychiatric history. In anovulatory cycles, whether induced or spontaneous, the cyclical nature of symptoms disappeared. This shows the important role that the corpus luteum has in precipitating symptoms in PMS. GnRH-agonists can be used to induce anovulation and this will stop the cyclical changes. Postmenopausal women receiving oestradiol/progestagen sequential treatment develop PMS-like symptoms when progestagen is added to the treatment. Symptoms seem to be dose dependent related to the oestradiol during the luteal but not the folicular phase. The intracerebral effects that cause the symptoms are still unknown. Progesterone metabolites have, however, been shown to interact with the GABA-A receptor in a similar manner to benzodiazepins and barbiturates, and they also have anxiolytic effects. Progesterone metabolites may occur which have the opposite effect on the GABA-A receptor, producing anxiogenic effects.",

Older people may suffer from conditions such as knee osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain and headache, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and cancer-related pain. Pain may impact physical function, psychological function, and other aspects of quality of life. A thorough history and physical examination may optimally assess a person with a persistent pain complaint in the context of a multifactorial pathway from accumulated impairments in multiple systems. Older people may perceive that integrative medicine treatments based on lifestyle and lower-risk therapies may help them get relief from pain and improve quality of life. Follow-up evaluation of positive and negative effects of therapeutic modalities and medications may guide the treatment plan.",

This chapter presents an overview of its definition and assessment, clinical symptoms, epidemiology, natural history, risk factors, and treatment. CS is found worldwide and has a lifetime prevalence of 5.8% in the U.S. general population. The disorder occurs mainly in women, has an onset in the late teen years or early 20s, and appears to be chronic or recurrent. Subjects with CS are preoccupied with shopping, experience pre-purchase tension or anxiety, and have a sense of relief following a purchase. CS is associated with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders. The disorder tends to run in families with mood and substance use disorders. There are no standard approved treatments. Medication studies have produced mixed results, but cognitive behavioral treatment models appear promising.",

Alcohol may have significance as a risk factor for the perpetrator (culprit, car driver, etc.), as well as for the victim. This is especially clear in cases of violence and assault. Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose-response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo-graphic factors must be taken into account. The populations studied are often selected, e.g., from emergency departments, pathology units (postmortem data), or related to those epidemiological studies based on interviews.

      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

Sexual dysfunction (SD) may be primarily due to physical disorders, including endocrinologic (diabetes, androgen deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), cardiovascular and pelvic illnesses. SD can be secondary or indirectly related to impairments of the physical disorder such as fatigue, weakness and bladder incontinence, or to the psychosocial stress of the illness. Not only the disease itself, but the treatment prescribed, may also cause sexual impairment. SD is prevalent among psychiatric patients and maybe related to both the psychopathology and the psychopharmacology. SD has been reported in as many as 30%-60% of patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotic medication, up to 78% of individuals with depression treated with antidepressants and up to 80% in patients suffering from anxiety disorder. Eating disorders and personality disorders, mainly borderline personality disorder, are also associated with SD. Psychosocial factors, like interpersonal relationships, length of relationship, lifestyle, socioeconomic class and cultural background have been shown to correlate with SD, especially in hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women. An evaluation of SD should take into consideration the primary sexual functioning, the physical and mental disorders, the various medications and the psychosocial factors. It is recommended to identify the specific cause of the SD and to treat the patient according to the individual's mental disorder, physical disorder and interpersonal relationship.",

Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time.

The patterns of psychological distress and psychiatric disorder among women are quite different than those in men. Women and men are genetically similar except that different hormones at different time and speed effect different regions of the brain resulting some brain cells to sprout faster than the others at the time of critical brain development. Psychosocial factors like poverty, hunger, malnutrition, over work, domestic violence, sexual abuse and stigma also affect women’s mental health. Differences between genders have been reported in the age of onset of symptoms, clinical features, frequency of symptoms, course, social adjustment, and long-term outcome of mental disorders. Moreover, women have a higher mean level of internalizing disorders than men. While women are at a disadvantageous position when it comes to disorders like affective disorder and Alzheimers disease, but they have a better prognosis when it comes to schizophrenia. Mental health problems starting in female children and adolescents effect the processes of adaptation and functionality into adulthood. According to WHO, depressive disorder account for 41.9% of disability among women compared to males. (29.3%). Prevalence of anxiety disorder, sexual and domestic violence and substance use are also increasing among women across different countries and different settings. CONCLUSION A gendered perspective of psychiatry holds great promise for more effectively preventing and treating psychiatric disorders in women and it may be useful to view women’s mental health across lifespan for better understanding and management of the disorders.",

Penyebab sarkopenia diduga multifaktorial termasuk: faktor lingkungan, penyakit, aktivasi jalur inflamasi, disfungsi mitokondria, hilangnya sambungan neuromuskular, berkurangnya jumlah sel satelit dan perubahan kualitas fungsi hormonal. Diagnosis sarkopenia dikonfirmasi oleh adanya kuantitas atau kualitas otot yang rendah.

      "abstract": "Background: Alcohol use disorders, defined as the maintenance of alcohol use for at least a 12-month period despite negative psychological, biological, behavioral, and social consequences, are frequently associated with psychotic symptoms. Objective: Our aim in this paper is to review alcohol-related clinical conditions that are accompanied by psychotic symptoms, alcohol-induced psychotic disorder, alcohol withdrawal delirium, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, Korsakoff’s dementia, comorbid schizophrenia, or delusional disorder. Methods: This is a non-systematic, narrative review based on the relevant literature indexed in PubMed and Google Scholar databases [2000-2020]. Results: Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is characterized by the presence of auditory hallucinations or delusions. In the state of alcohol withdrawal, tactile, visual hallucinations and delusions are common. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, caused by malnutrition secondary to chronic alcohol misuse, is characterized by the presence of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and a range of mental disturbances. The dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder rests on shared biological impairments, as shown by neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies. The subtype of the delusional disorder called Othello’s syndrome, or delusional jealousy based on false beliefs of infidelity, is often seen in the context of alcohol alone or alcohol and neurological disorder. Treatment for alcoholic disorders with psychotic symptoms are dietary, psychological, and pharmacological. Conclusions: There are a number of alcohol-related psychotic syndromes, each requiring its own specific treatment approach.",

      "title": "STRESS AND HEART",
      "abstract": "Background : Human beings throughout the world are faced with high and ever increasing levels of acute or chronic stress. Acute stress is defined as “the normal short-term physiological response to the perception of major threat or demands”. Chronic stress is defined as “the abnormal ongoing physiological response to the continuing perception of irresolvable major threats or demands”. 1 In fact, all these modern definitions of stress date back to the time of Hans Selye, the first scientist who studied the effects of stress on health and physiological integrity of living organisms. 2 Accordingly, the term stress pertains to effects of all environmental and psychosocial factors on physical or mental well-being. 1 The effect of stress on cardiovascular system has bean discussed for many years, 3 although until recently, the evidence has been relatively weak due to the complexity of such a relationship. 4 Among the many different types of stressors, mental and psychosocial stressors exert profound effects on the circulatory system. Primary studies on the relationship of stress with cardiovascular disease focused mainly on type A personality, then shifting to more specific components, i.e. hostility and anger, as stressful factors that provoke cardiovascular problems. 5 Behavioral or psychosocial stress induces or influences the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect. Psychosocial stress has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress which disturbs endothelial integrity and induces endothelial injury and dysfunction. 6 These processes activate beta 1-adrenoceptors that cause sympathoadrenal activation, which in turn enhances atherosclerosis. Also, behavioral or psychosocial stressors decrease estrogen, which may be of importance for the development of premenopausal atherosclerosis. 7 (1) HamidReza Roohafza MD. Psychiatrist,  Mental Health Research Unit, Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. Email: roohafza@crc.mui.ac.ir Stress is strongly associated with CAD. Clinically, mental stress is a cause of angina and may specifically worsen CAD. By provoking a dynamic decrease in coronary supply, mental stress may activate the ischemic response and induce substantial myocardial ischemia, and in the long term adversely affect prognosis in CAD patients. 8,9 Hostility and anger have also been shown to negatively influence ejection fraction and myocardial blood circulation, pointing out the importance of these phenomena as the etiology of CAD. 5 However, other forms of stress also have an impact. Behavioral/ psychosocial stress may participate in the development of CAD, via neuroendocrine mediation through sympathoadrenal activation (chronic sympathetic hyperarousal), seen clinically in angina/chest pain associated with normal coronary angiograms. 10 Stress clearly has the potential to actively trigger threatening cardiac events that lead to myocardial infarction. Mental stress increases the myocardial oxygen demand via sympathoadrenal activation and also involves a reduction in the myocardial oxygen supply, an eventually fatal consequence. 11 Mental stress obviously has a profound impact on long-term cardiac events and outcome. In particular, mental stress may cause paradoxical constrictions in patients with CAD/atherosclerosis, especially at points of stenosis - a response that correlates with the extent of atherosclerosis (plaque) and with the endothelium-dependent response to an infusion of acetylcholine (verification of endothelial dysfunction). 12 Discussion : Stress contributes to the onset, development, progression, and treatment delay of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of stress is high in both developing and developed countries, 13 an example of which is a large multicomponent interventional project on lifestyle habits performed in Iran, named Isfahan Healthy Heart Program, the results of which show high stress levels in 40% of men and 45% of women. 14 Thus, ‘lifestyle’ needs to be a central focus of prevention, 13 as this ‘epidemic of stress’ 1 may turn into a critical medical issue. Stress management interventions such as cognitive behavioral strategies to improve adaptive methods, and the use of relaxation response techniques are of growing importance in the future. 14",

There are factors that remain poorly understood in the study of refractory epilepsy such as the age and gender of patients and the presence of psychiatric comorbidities. It is known that in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), the comorbidities contribute to the deterioration of the quality of life, increase the severity, and worsen the prognosis of epilepsy. Some studies have demonstrated that patients diagnosed with a co-occurrence of epilepsy and psychiatric disorders are more likely to present refractory seizures and the probability of seizure remission after pharmacotherapy is reduced. The evidence of this association suggests the presence of shared pathogenic mechanisms that may include endocrine disorders, neuroinflammatory processes, disturbances of neurotransmitters, and mechanisms triggered by stress. Additionally, significant demographic, clinical, and electrographic differences have been observed between women and men with epilepsy. Epilepsy affects the female gender in a greater proportion, although there are no studies that report whether refractoriness affects more females. The reasons behind these sex differences are unclear; however, it is likely that sex hormones and sex brain differences related to chromosomal genes play an important role. On the other hand, it has been shown in industrialized countries that prevalence of DRE is higher in the elderly when compared to youngsters. Conversely, this phenomenon is not observed in developing regions, where more cases are found in children and young adults. The correct identification and management of these factors is crucial in order to improve the quality of life of the patients.",

When the uncooperative behavior includes non-compliance with medication, it is important that these factors be examined and dealt with immediately to ensure amelioration of symptoms before the elderly person's health and lifestyle are seriously affected.",

Although pathalophysiological abnormalities exist across many domain, but several lines of research suggest that it may be distinct from psychiatric disorder. The nature of the symptoms, however, can help clinicians differentiate CFS from other illnesses.

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy. Phytotherapeutics are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence. Light therapy and exercise regimes may be useful as adjunct therapies. Acupuncture, aromatherapy, foot reflexology, homeopathy, meditative movement, moxibustion, and yoga are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence.",

Withdrawal from sexual intimacy because of fear of failure can damage relationships and have a profound effect on overall wellbeing for the couple.2 Since erectile dysfunction often accompanies chronic illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, and a variety of neurological diseases, physicians from many medical disciplines will see patients with this disorder.3\n\n#### Summary points\n\nAlthough around 10% of men aged 40 to 70 years have complete erectile dysfunction, only a few seek medical help\n\nAs erectile dysfunction is frequently associated with a number of systemic illnesses and surgical treatments, a wide range of doctors must be aware of the condition in their patients\n\nCurrent effective treatments include psychosexual counselling, vacuum erection devices, intracavernosal and transurethral drug delivery, and penile prostheses\n\nPromising oral treatments are currently being investigated\n\nBoth doctors and the public need to be better informed about erectile dysfunction and its treatment\n\nThe publications comprising this review were selected from a formal search of the full Medline database (using the terms erectile dysfunction, impotence, and penile erection).

In this review, we provide an update of recent studies on the age of onset (AOO) of the major mental disorders, with a special focus on the availability and use of services providing prevention and early intervention. Recent findings. The studies reviewed here confirm previous reports on the AOO of the major mental disorders. Although the behaviour disorders and specific anxiety disorders emerge during childhood, most of the high-prevalence disorders (mood, anxiety and substance use) emerge during adolescence and early adulthood, as do the psychotic disorders. Early AOO has been shown to be associated with a longer duration of untreated illness, and poorer clinical and functional outcomes. Summary. Although the onset of most mental disorders usually occurs during the first three decades of life, effective treatment is typically not initiated until a number of years later. There is increasing evidence that intervention during the early stages of disorder may help reduce the severity and/or the persistence of the initial or primary disorder, and prevent secondary disorders. However, additional research is needed on effective interventions in early-stage cases, as well as on the long-term effects of early intervention, and for an appropriate service design for those with emerging mental disorders. This will mean not only the strengthening and re-engineering of existing systems, but is also crucial the construction of new streams of care for young people in transition to adulthood.",

We report three cases of adolescents who were admitted to general paediatrics services for abdominal pain and/or nausea and vomiting with a negative medical workup. In each case, a clear psychosocial stressor was evident. It is possible that somatic symptoms without clear medical causes may reflect psychosocial stress, but it is difficult to discern whether the psychosocial issues preceded the somatic complaints or were a result of them. Making an accurate diagnosis is difficult, and broaching such a subject with patients and their families is a delicate matter.

Psychogenic or exogenous factors include occupational factors, such as, retirement, familial factors, such as death of one's spouse, and independence of one's children, and somatic factors, such as ageing and somatic diseases. Atypical symptoms are more frequently seen than in the younger age. Somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, agitation and paranoid are seen more frequently than in the younger age. On the other hand psychomotor inhibition is not so serious after the middle age. Masked depression, depressive pseudo-dementia and drug-induced depressive state are seen more often, and they should be distinguished from somatic diseases and dementia. On manic state typical manic symptoms such as flight of ideas and manic excitement, are not seen so often as in the younger age. Adequate rest, medication and psychotherapy are necessary for the therapy of affective disorders. Considering pharmacokinetics in the elderly, anti-depressants with less side effects should be chosen and they should be started from one-third of the regular dosage at most.",

These symptoms are found to be independent from other symptoms in longitudinal and cross-sectional assesments. The negative symptoms are named as primary or idiopathic if they are present at beginning of the disease or if it is specific to the disease. If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Functional disability is common in older adults. It is often episodic and is associated with a high risk of subsequent health decline. The severity of disability is determined by physical impairments caused by underlying medical conditions, and by external factors such as social support, financial support, and the environment. When multiple health conditions are present, they often result in greater disability than expected because the patient's ability to compensate for one problem may be affected by comorbid conditions. Evaluation of functional disability is most effective when the physician determines the course of the disability, associated symptoms, effects on specific activities, and coping mechanisms the patient uses to compensate for the functional problem. Underlying health conditions, impairments, and contextual factors (e.g., finances, social support) should be identified using validated screening tools. Interventions should focus on increasing the patient's capacity to cope with task demands and reducing the demands of the task itself. Interventions for functional decline in older adults are almost always multifactorial because they must address multiple conditions, impairments, and contextual factors.",

CSB has significant consequences, including but not limited to personal distress, depression, anxiety, and a high risk of sexually transmitted diseases. CSB is often seen along with other psychiatric disorders, most commonly with major depressive and substance use disorders. A primary goal of treatment for CSB is to help manage the uncontrollable impulses and urges a patient endures by reducing excessive sexual behavior with the use of psychotherapy, self-help groups, and medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs are well-known for their pharmacotherapeutic role in many psychiatric and medical conditions; however, symptoms of hyposexuality are notable side effects. Here we report our findings on a patient, a 36-year-old male who classified himself as a sex addict since late adolescence, participating in various forms of sexual-related activities at high frequency. He presented to the outpatient clinic for treatment for depression alongside his CSB. He was successfully treated with an SSRI, fluoxetine.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of gender dysphoria symptoms in adolescents presenting psychotic disorders generates great diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. They are related not only to the question of what is the nature of the reported dissatisfaction with one’s biological sex, but also to the normative period of uncertainty and searching in the process of psychosexual development in a young person. In this context, reaching a decision on gender correction treatment requires a particularly thorough analysis, a precise differential diagnosis and, above all, stabilisation of the psychological state as well as prolonged observation and exclusion of the delusional basis of gender dysphoria. It strikes us as particularly important to provide such patients with appropriate care. Allowing for gender correction, in the absence of a confirmed causal relationship between the two disorders, seems to be an appropriate, although debatable, therapeutic approach. Refusing medical interventions in adolescents in a timely manner poses a significant risk of psychological deterioration, may exacerbate gender dysphoria and contribute to self-representation provoking persecution and stigmatisation, and thus may increase stress levels, which is an important factor in psychotic decompensation.",

A review of studies on stress and/or coping strategies in SLE since 1990 is presented. Many studies have investigated the place of major and minor stress and coping strategies in SLE morbidity (disease activity, organ damage, and physical and mental components of quality of life). Stress as a causal factor is not proved, but it seems to act as an exacerbating factor in disease activity and to have an impact on the quality of life. Coping strategies are more consistently associated with quality of life than with disease activity. Organ damage appears to be less associated with psychosocial factors than disease activity or quality of life. Despite the limitations of these studies, therapeutic interventions should be proposed to reduce psychological distress, to improve the quality of life and possibly to moderate the evolution of the disease.",

Some men assume that erectile failure is a natural part of the aging process and tolerate it, for others it is devastating. Withdrawal from sexual intimacy because of fear of failure can damage relationships and have a profound effect on overall wellbeing for the couple. Erectile dysfunction often accompanies chronic illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, and a variety of neurological diseases. Therefore, physicians need to identify any underlying co-existing organic diseases in their patients presenting with ED. Whenever possible, patients are encouraged to attend their consultation sessions with their partners because ED is a condition affecting the couple' and not just the man. Psychogenic aspects of ED should also be explored during the consultation. The first-line treatment of ED is oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. For those who do not respond to oral therapy, there is no defined 'step-ladder' escalation in alternative therapy. It is up to the physician to discuss the options with the patient or couple and reach a decision based on their preference.&#x0D; JCMCTA 2012 ; 23 (2): 5-17",

If duration of tics is less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder or Unspecified Tic Disorder and skip to Vocal Tics. Symptoms must have persisted for at least 1 year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

      "abstract": "The name schizophrenia comes from a combination of the Greek words shizeiu - to split and fren - reason. Eugen Bleuler has introduced the name schizophrenia in 1991 and the goal was to replace the negative meaning of the disease. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that does not allow a sick person to distinguish the real from the unreal experience, interferes with daily thinking and emotional experiences towards others and disrupts normal social functioning. The symptoms that occur in this disease are delusions, hallucinations, illusions, disorganization and impoverishment of mental functions. The symptoms of the disease are divided into positive and negative. The disease occurs between the ages of 15 and 35, and we recognize it by its early symptoms, sometimes these symptoms are absent, so the disease is noticed only in the acute phase, only the beginning of the disease is gradual or sudden. The diagnosis of schizophrenia requires that the patient's symptoms be present for at least six months and that there is a prodromal phase that lasts for another 5 months, with some symptoms maintaining, but in a milder form. Schizophrenia is treated with drugs, but they are not enough to achieve the highest possible level of independence in patients later in life, so psychosocial methods are also used. It is of great importance to involve the patient's family, environment and community in the treatment process so that the return to normal life and recovery is as fast and high quality as possible. Schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental illness, it is caused by prejudice, stigmatization entails discrimination, which ultimately has negative consequences for the patient and his family. A nurse is the person who spends the most time with a patient with schizophrenia, so she is the only one who can notice problems in the field of health care. Nursing documentation is also of great importance and the first step in patient care. To solve the problem, the nurse selects the most appropriate nursing interventions that are patient-centered and individualized for himself. A good and quality relationship of trust between the nurse and the patient is the most important characteristic of quality health care.",

      "title": "Is Love Passion an Addictive Disorder?",
      "abstract": "Aims: Inquiry regarding the relationship between passionate love and addiction has long been a topic of intense debate. Recent advances in neurobiology now allow for an examination between these two states. Methods: After describing the clinical distinctions between \"love passion,\" \"love addiction,\" and \"sex addiction,\" we compare clinical, neuropsychological, neurobiological, and neuroimaging data on love, passion, pathological gambling (PG) and substance dependence. Results: There are no recognized definitions or diagnostic criteria for \"love addiction,\" but its phenomenology has some similarities to substance dependence: euphoria and unrestrained desire in the presence of the love object or associated stimuli (drug intoxication); negative mood, anhedonia, and sleep disturbance when separated from the love object (drug withdrawal); focussed attention on and intrusive thoughts about the love object; and maladaptive or problematic patterns of behavior (love relation) leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, with pursuit despite knowledge of adverse consequences. Limited animal and human studies suggest that brain regions (e.g., insula, anterior cingulated [ACC], orbitofrontal [OFC]) and neurotransmitters (dopamine) that mediate substance dependence may also be involved with love addiction (as for PG). Ocytocin (OT), which is implicated in social attachment and mating behavior, may also be involved in substance dependence. There are no data on the epidemiology, genetics, co-morbidity, or treatment of love addiction. Conclusion: There are currently insufficient data to place some cases of \"love passion\" within a clinical disorder, such as \"love addiction,\" in an official diagnostic nomenclature or to firmly classify it as a behavioral addiction or disorder of impulse control. Further clinical and scientific studies are needed to improve our understanding and treatment of this condition. For these studies, we propose new criteria for evaluating addiction to love.",

Optimal management should also include a discussion of factors that could impact negatively on seizure control (e.g. poor adherence to the prescribed treatment schedule, or sleep deprivation), without placing undue restrictions on the patient's lifestyle. Counselling about marriage, reproduction, driving regulations and other legal matters may be indicated. If treatment is indicated, the choice of the antiepileptic drug should be tailored to the characteristics of the patient, including seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, age, gender, comorbidities and any concurrently taken medications. Drug treatment is generally started at a low dose and up-titrated gradually, aiming at identifying the lowest maintenance dosage that controls seizures without causing undue adverse effects. Clinical response should be regularly monitored, and special attention should be given to identification and management of potential side-effects. If the initially prescribed drug used at optimized dosage fails to control the seizures completely, diagnostic re-evaluation may be warranted. Monotherapy with an alternative antiepileptic drug may then be tried, although some patients may benefit from early introduction of combination therapy. When combination therapy is used, consideration should be given to the possibility of adverse pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions, which may require adjustments in dosage. Not all drug combinations are equally effective, and evidence has accumulated that some antiepileptic drug combinations can be more efficacious and better tolerated than others. Particularly in patients with difficult-to-control epilepsy, caution must be taken to avoid overtreatment (i.e. the situation where the side-effects of medication adversely affect quality of life more than the seizures themselves). The duration of antiepileptic drug therapy also needs to be individualized, and the feasibility of gradually discontinuing medications may be considered after at least 2 years of seizure freedom. The decision whether to withdraw or continue treatment requires careful discussion with the patient and/or the parents, and should take into consideration not only the risk (and consequences) of seizure recurrence, which is largely dependent on the patient's epilepsy syndrome, but also the risks of adverse effects resulting from continuation of therapy.",

These events range from extreme high magnitude stressors such as torture, terror attacks, rape, childhood sexual abuse, natural disasters, or war to more commonly experienced stressors such as the loss of a romantic relationship, persistent physical illness, or business difficulties. Traumatic-stressor exposure is common and, for the majority of individuals exposed to stressors, normal psychological reactions that occur in the immediate aftermath will abate within days or months of the event. Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder share the same traumatic stressor criteria involving \"exposure to a threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation\" and include direct experiencing, witnessing, or learning about a stressor.",

For example, regulatory changes affecting the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems may have broad impact on adaptation to orthostatic stress. Common clinical manifestations of autonomic dysfunction in elderly patients include orthostatic hypotension (OH), postprandial hypotension, hypothermia, and heat stroke. These are rarely problematic in healthy elderly individuals under the usual demands of life, but may become clinically significant during exposure to a variety of external influences, such as medications, changes in fluid intake, or relatively hot or cold environmental temperatures. Other geriatric problems such as constipation, urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction may mimic autonomic insufficiency, but are usually caused by conditions outside of the autonomic nervous system. For example, sexual dysfunction in old age is more likely due to vascular disease, diabetes, depression, or medications, than it is to age-associated autonomic dysfunction....",

      "abstract": "Sexual function and to a lesser extent reproduction are often disrupted in women with spinal cord injuries (SCI), who must be educated to better understand their sexual and reproductive health. Women with SCI are sexually active; they can use psychogenic or reflexogenic stimulation to obtain sexual pleasure and orgasm. Treatment should consider a holistic approach using autonomic standards to describe remaining sexual function and to assess both genital function and psychosocial factors. Assessment of genital function should include thoracolumbar dermatomes, vulvar sensitivity (touch, pressure, vibration), and sacral reflexes. Self-exploration should include not only clitoral stimulation, but also stimulation of the vagina (G spot), cervix, and nipples conveyed by different innervation sources. Treatments may consider PDE5 inhibitors and flibanserin on an individual basis, and secondary consequences of SCI should address concerns with spasticity, pain, incontinence, and side effects of medications. Psychosocial issues must be addressed as possible contributors to sexual dysfunctions (eg, lower self-esteem, past sexual history, depression, dating habits). Pregnancy is possible for women with SCI; younger age at the time of injury and at the time of pregnancy being significant predictors of successful pregnancy, along with marital status, motor score, mobility, and occupational scores. Pregnancy may decrease the level of functioning (eg, self-care, ambulation, upper-extremity tasks), may involve complications (eg, decubitus ulcers, weight gain, urological complications), and must be monitored for postural hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia. Taking into consideration the physical and psychosocial determinants of sexuality and childbearing allows women with SCI to achieve positive sexual and reproductive health.",

Our differential diagnosis includes vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, pseudodementia, dialysis dementia, and early-onset Alzheimer’s.

Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream.

For years, there has been a controversy as to whether addiction was simply a moral failing or a brain disease. Obviously, the latter is true. As with any disease, addiction and co-occurring disorders are frequently considered to be primary, progressive, chronic, and, if untreated, fatal. With the advent of more sophisticated neurobiological and multivariate research, we can get beyond trivializing this serious disease entity by labeling it as a weakness or character defect, and get on with the significant work of focusing on those neurological pathways and their etiology that are responsible for addictive patterns of behavior.",

Epidemiological data estimate that at least 5% of people with type I bipolar disorder never experienced depression. These subjects are more often males with a hyperthymic temperament, a younger age at onset, and more psychotic features. Current classification systems do not formally recognize UM, but different definitions of mania without depression have been proposed. UM should be assessed according to the number of mood episodes, the predominance of manic or hypomanic episodes, and its clinical course. More generally, UM should be considered in the context of an affective spectrum including different clinical phenotypes based on the predominance of depressive or manic symptoms. Additional clinical and epidemiological research in this field is needed.",

      "title": "Is depression a problem in patients with chronic heart failure?",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in routine activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure. There are several depression classification systems and diagnostic tools based on clinical symptoms, i.e. the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Scale and Beck's Depression Inventory. Depression frequently occurs in patients with heart failure, as similar pathophysiological mechanisms of neurohormonal activation, arrhythmia, inflammation and hypercoagulation are present in both these diseases. Prognosis in patients with depression is also affected by insufficient cooperation between a patient and his doctor as regards the lifestyle and medication intake of a patient. Depression is usually accompanied by remission and relapse periods which might be related to the current heart failure status of a patient and despite intensive medical treatment they may recur. Depression is often difficult to diagnose or even left undiagnosed and thus untreated, because its symptoms: fatigue, apathy and decreased exercise tolerance, are common in the general population. Furthermore, safety and efficacy of antidepressant therapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases are not well established. Evidence from clinical trials evaluating the influence of depression behavioral and pharmacological treatment on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure is also limited. Taking into account that depression affects prognosis in patients with variety of disorders and common pathological mechanisms present both in depression and heart failure, screening tests for depression should be considered not only in patients with diagnosed heart failure but also those at risk of heart failure development.",

      "title": "Peculiarities of insomnia in men and women at different age periods",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

The existing knowledge of the influence of medication upon female sexual function is very sparse. Treatment with SSRIs and other antidepressants may cause decreased libido and organism problems. Antipsychotic treatment often causes libido, lubrication, and orgasm problems. Spironolactone may cause decreased libido and impaired lubrication. Whether antihypertensives, H2-receptor antagonists and sex hormones have sexual adverse effects has not been clarified properly. Some drugs, such as bupropion and sildenafil, may enhance the sexual function, but further studies have to be carried out. The need for further research on the topic is stressed.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction are common symptoms associated with depression. Optimal antidepressant treatment should result in remission of the symptoms of the underlying illness and minimize the potential for short- and long-term adverse effects, including sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction are frequently persistent or worsen with the use of some antidepressant medications; this sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction can have negative impact on adherence to treatment, quality of life, and the possibility of relapse. Successful management of sexual complaints during antidepressant treatment should begin with a systematic approach to determine the type of sexual dysfunction, potential contributing factors, and finally management strategies that should be tailored to the individual patient. The basic physiologic mechanisms of the normal sexual phases of libido, arousal, and orgasm and how these mechanisms may be interrupted by some antidepressants provide a framework for the clinician to utilize in order to minimize sexual complaints when initiating and continuing antidepressant treatment. This article provides guidelines, based upon this type of model, for the assessment, management, and prevention of sexual side effects associated with antidepressant treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cushing’s syndrome may present with various psychiatric disorders which can lead to a misdiagnosis at the beginning, deterioration of the course of the disease and life-threatening complications. The most common psychiatric disorder is atypical depression. During the initial stages of the disease, the somatic symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome can be subtle, difficult to identify, especially when the psychiatric symptoms are dominant. Objective: The aim of the present article is to report a case of a 24-year-old woman with a Cushing’s syndrome, caused by the adrenal adenoma. The onset of the disease is a suicidal attempt. Family history is significant for psychiatry disorder. The belated diagnosis led to somatic and psychiatry complications of the disease – sepsis and persisting high suicidal risk. The dynamic change in the patient’s mental state – from a severe depressive episode with atypical symptoms to psychosis with single catatonic symptoms – correlated well with the gradual increase of the plasma cortisol levels. The antidepressant and subsequent antipsychotic medication turned out to be ineffective. The surgical treatment, followed by a normalization of the cortisol levels was a key to the successful outcome and the reduction of self-aggression risk. Conclusion: The early diagnosis and timely treatment of Cushing’s syndrome decrease the risk of multiple complications. The shift from atypical depression to psychosis with catatonic symptoms correlates with the worsening of the hormonal imbalance. The signs of atypical depression in Cushing's syndrome, resistant to the antidepressant medication, could be considered as relatively specific symptoms, guiding specialists to its somatogenic origin for the proper diagnosis.",

The dysfunction associated with cardiac disease is mainly organic in origin. A myocardial infarct causes distress to both patient and partner and can lead to further dysfunction that is mainly psychological in origin. This gradually improves over a year but is a cause of great apprehension. Patients and partners desire counselling but it is not often forthcoming. There is no consensus on the best form, or any proof of its effectiveness. Angina also causes great distress and can lead to sexual dysfunction but drug treatment of the angina can lead to an improved sex life. Other drugs used to treat cardiovascular disease can lead to sexual dysfunction. Recommendations are made for counselling after an infarct.",

Its deficiency arises easy fatiguability, loss of sexual desire, loss of erection, and oligo- or azoospermia. Erectile dysfunction is frequently caused by vascular, neurological and psychosomatic disorders. A variety of drugs are known to cause male sexual insufficiency. Many environmental factors and stress may affect the release of LH and GH, and therefore disturb the male sexual function.",

      "title": "Characteristics of Executive Functions in Patients With Cognitive Impairments in the Presence of Depressive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Introduction. The urgency of the problem of affective pathology and, above all, depression, due to a number of factors: the growing prevalence of depression, reaching 10.0 % in the population, the high risk of chronic such conditions, their maladaptive impact on social functioning, efficiency and quality of life, the burden of economic costs etc. According to epidemiological indicators in Ukraine over the past 10 years, the incidence of affective disorders has increased by 6.13 %, and the prevalence – by 13.16 %. Impaired thinking and executive functions, decreased concentration and difficulty making decisions are key diagnostic signs of depression. Cognitive impairment (CI) has a cumulative effect on the functionality of patients with depression and is associated with a longer duration of depressive episodes, which indicates the need for its diagnosis and treatment. At the present stage, there are no systematic ideas about the specifics of disorders of executive functions in the presence of different types of depressive disorders (DD), which determines the relevance of the study in this direction. The aim of the study. Describe the executive functions in patients with CI in the presence of DD. Materials and methods. The study included 362 patients with CI in the presence of DD, which were stratified into three groups of comparisons by the mechanism of DD: 123 patients with recurrent depressive disorders (RDD), 141 patients with bipolar affective disorder (BAD) and 98 people with prolonged depressive reaction (PDR). The predominant numbers (38.12 %) of patients with CI in the presence of DD were in adulthood (30-44 years). There were more young people (18-29 years) among patients with PDR (21.43 %, DC = 8.19) and among patients with BAD (31.21 %, DC = 9.82), and middle-aged people (45-59 years) (37.40 %, DC = 1.54) and the elderly (60-74 years) (17.07 %, DC = 4.78) – among patients with RDD. A set of research methods was used: clinical-psychopathological, psychodiagnostic and statistical. Results. Peculiarities of executive functions in patients with CI in the presence of DD were established: the moderate and severe disorders of visual-motor coordination (39.84 % and 19.51 %, respectively) and impaired visual-spatial functions (13.72 %), moderate and severe violations of executive functions (54.47 % and 13.01 %, respectively), moderate, severe and weak violations of the executive function of the lexical system (39.84 %, 32.52 % and 23.58 %, respectively) were present in patients with RDD; the moderate violations of verbal performance (58.54 %); moderate and severe violations of visual-motor coordination (41.13 % and 26.24 %, respectively), executive functions (65.96 % и 21.38 %, respectively), executive functions of the lexical system (47.52 % и 39,01 %, respectively) and verbal productivity (58.16 % and 21.28 % respectively) were found in BAD; absence and weak impairments of visual-motor coordination (45.92 % and 36.73 %, respectively), executive functions (23.47 % and 66.33 %, respectively), executive functions of the lexical system (31.63 % and 45.92 %, respectively) and verbal productivity (26.53 % and 58.16 %, respectively) were presented in patients with PDR. Conclusions. The study revealed the features of executive functions in patients with cognitive impairment in the presence of depressive disorders, which should be taken into account in the algorithm of their psychosocial rehabilitation.",

Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

The pathogenesis is multifactorial but is probably often due to changes in the autonomic nervous system, as well as to age-related changes in the cardiovascular and endocrine systems. In addition, the presence of multiple diseases and medications are common contributing factors. Standardized measurement of postural blood pressure and recording of heart rate and assessment of associated symptoms are essential for the clinical diagnosis. Evaluation and management depend on an initial thorough clinical review of problems. Usually elimination of offending medications and treatment of contributing medical disorders are adequate. Occasionally, use of volume expanders and newer experimental agents is indicated. Postural hypotension can be seen as a prototypical clinical disorder of the elderly. It reflects impaired homeostasis; its etiology is multifactorial and due to the effects of both age and disease; it is clinically protean; and it can result in falls, injury, and progressive decline if not recognized and treated early.",

      "title": "Economic Stress, Precariousness and Risk of High Blood Pressure: A Descriptive Survey of Life Models within Households of the Central Region of Cameroon",
      "abstract": "Context/Objective: High blood pressure (HBP) currently represents the most widespread chronic non-communicable disease in Cameroon. The increase in its prevalence in the country is the result of multiple factors including economic stress imposed by precariousness, poor living conditions, sources of anxiety, anguish, depression and other behavioral disorders. Economic stress is a globalizing concept that integrates into a purely hermeneutic approach, a particular functioning of the nervous system of an individual who faces employment problems and precarious remuneration conditions. The non-satisfaction by an individual of his basic needs due to insufficient financial means can cause him to become irritable, aggressive, and socially and symbolically isolated, thereby increasing the desire to resort to morbid life models such as excessive consumption of narcotics and other psychoactive substances often associated with high blood pressure. The fight against the emergence of BPH is a complex, multifaceted and multifactorial reality that requires taking into account economic stress. The main objective of this survey is to describe the situation of economic stress within the Cameroonian population, which imposes precariousness and life models at risk of high blood pressure. Specifically, we determined the level of household income and the sources of income. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a descriptive aim among five hundred households in the Central Region of Cameroon was conducted. A probabilistic technique called simple randomness was used. The number of households to be surveyed was determined indirectly using the Cochrane formula. Data collection in face-to-face mode using a physical questionnaire took place from July 1 to August 31, 2023, after obtaining ethical clearance from the Regional Health Research Ethics Committee, Human from the Center and an administrative authorization for data collection. Regarding their processing, the data was grouped during processing in Excel sheets. Normality and reliability tests of the collected data were carried out. For this, the Chi-square test was used for data with a qualitative value and that of Kolmogorov-Sminorf for data with a quantitative value. Descriptive analysis was possible using R software version 3.2, SPSS version 25.0, XLSTAT 2016, PAST and EXCEL programs from Microsoft Office 2013. Results: The main results highlight economic stress, with 45.60% of households surveyed earning less than US$154 per month; 55% of household heads were women in single-parent families; 14% of household heads were unemployed, 22% worked in the private sector and 19% were self-employed. This general economic situation leads to precarious living conditions, thereby increasing the risk of high blood pressure among the Cameroonian population.",

This disorder has clinical, psychosocial and medico-legal consequences, both to the patient and the people that surround him. Despite the scarce literature and infrequent reports, there are some descriptions of violent behaviours, sexual assault and sexual involvement of minors. Whenever we suspect that a patient suffers from sexsomnia, we must write a rigorous and complete clinical history, make a neurologic and phychiatric evaluation and nocturnal videopolysomnography. As soon as the diagnosis is established, we must plan treatment approaches. More attention should be payed to the psychosocial and medico-legal issues, and new research is needed to provide for better understanding of etiology and to improve the clinical evaluation and management.",

Clinical studies often reveal different prevalence rates and comorbidity figures from population-based surveys and this is partly due to selection bias and severity of symptoms, and diagnostic criteria and instruments used. Epidemiological studies have often used different diagnostic instruments, different sampling procedures, different case definitions, different time frames for the diagnoses (e.g. lifetime, six-month prevalence or current diagnoses) and different severity ratings for diagnostic decisions.",

Investigations to determine whether there might have been some injury causing brain damage reveal nothing. The child had a normal, full-term birth, with no resuscitation necessary. His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage. This person is then classified as epileptic; and view of the absence of any discernible lesion as cause, the term is qualified by essential or idiopathic. Such designations are certainly open to question. However, they have prevailed, and ought to be retained.

The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

Epidemiologic surveys have shown that these patients may display significant levels of functional impairment, have unexplained somatic symptoms and a high use of nonpsychiatric medical care, have long-lasting symptoms, and are at risk for more severe psychiatric disorders. A DSM-IV field trial concluded that patients with affective-symptoms not meeting thresholds for DSM-III-R disorders were at least as common as patients with anxiety or mood disorders, and that their symptoms were associated with significant distress or impairment.

      "abstract": "Abstract Couples in which one partner is diagnosable as depressed are encountered by virtually every marital therapist. In addition, couples in which one or both partners have significant levels of depressive symptoms are the norm rather than the exception in marital therapy. Similarly, therapists treating depressed clients individually often discover that marital distress is a major influence in many aspects of their clients’ lives. In response to the apparent interconnection of marital discord and adult unipolar depression, the topic of marital therapy for depressed adults has become an important focus of research. Several questions have been partially answered: Do marital problems precede and predict continuation of depressive symptoms or episodes of depression? Does marital therapy for depression produce improvement in couple distress, in depression, or both? Can marital distress be treated while a depressive episode is ongoing or only after it is over? Would a successful individually focused intervention for a depressive episode cause marital stress to disappear? What specific culture, age, and gender features influence the relationship between marital distress and depression? Our goal in the current chapter is to address these and other questions by presenting major findings in the literature to date and by summarizing them into a relatively simple argument as follows. Marital problems are often present for depressed persons; these problems are serious, and they carry unacceptable consequences for those depressed clients who suffer with them.",

In the meantime a high proportion of elderly people very often experience limitations in daily life due to impairments in memory and other cognitive functions. Non-cognitive neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly stress-related anxiety disorders, are a major contribution to maladaptation in these patients. The present studies of the neurobiology of aging enable one to decipher not only the mechanisms that underlie the physiology of brain aging, but also the factors that influence cognitive aging and aggravate the manifestations of cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease. The process of brain aging is known to presume the long-term preservation of functional neuroplasticity that is greatly influenced by different lifestyle factors, such as daily social and physical activities, the pattern and amount of food taken, cognitive activity, and stressful life events. These lifestyle factors are supposedly a potent tool to maintain physiological brain aging and a delayed cognitive diminution in elderly people. At the same time, studies of the possibility of pharmacologically correcting age-related (both cognitive and non-cognitive) impairments are promising to improve everyday function in elderly people.",

It is argued that each time an alcoholic takes a drink, this is the result of choice; however, in cases of serious affliction, such choices are compulsive and may be called ‘involuntary’ in that they are made against the subject’s will, motivated by an overwhelmingly powerful desire that he wishes he did not have and not to act on. Alternative accounts in terms social learning theory and behavioral economics are critiqued. The conception of alcoholism as a tripartite disease composed of a ‘physical allergy,’ a mental obsession, and a ‘spiritual malady’ is defended from a contemporary scientific point of view.",

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

There are various reasons for this, such as: a) the mingling of somatic and psychological symptomatology; b) believing that the presence of anxiety, depression, or insomnia is normal among patients with cancer; c) the lack of training of medical personnel in the detection of psychiatric disorders; or d) viewing these disorders as secondary to the illness itself and to the oncological treatments. This research paper deals with insomnia, anxiety, and depression among cancer patients, as being the disorders with the highest incidence among them and with the greatest impact on their well-being. We present guidelines for the detection of these disorders, as well as their pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment.",

      "title": "The Occurrence of Funeral Mania After Bereavement: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Stressful or traumatic life events can lead to emergence of mood episodes. Events such as migration, relocation, job loss, bankruptcy, economic loss, divorce, natural disasters, accidental injury, or the loss of a loved one can trigger the first episode of bipolar disorder. After such life events, symptoms of depressive episodes often appear. Funeral mania, on the other hand, is defined as the emergence of manic episodes following the death of a close family member. Information on funeral mania, which occurs shortly after the loss of a loved one, is limited with a few case reports. In this study, a 26-year-old female patient who presented with the symptoms of a manic episode for the first time after her father's death and who had no previous psychiatric disease or treatment history was presented in the light of findings in the literature. It is noteworthy that the patient, who was followed up with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mania period) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, had a temporal closeness between her mood symptoms and her father's death, and had not developed such a reaction to previous traumatic life events. Therefore, the diagnosis was evaluated as funeral mania. It should be kept in mind that, although rare, symptoms of mania can be seen among possible grief reactions.Strese neden olan ya da örseleyici yaşam olayları duygudurum dönemlerinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilir. Göç, taşınma, yer değiştirme, işini kaybetme, iflas, ekonomik kayıp, boşanma, doğal afetler, kaza sonucu yaralanma ya da yakınını kaybetme gibi olaylar bipolar bozukluğun ilk hastalık dönemini tetikleyebilir. Bu tür yaşam olaylarından sonra genellikle depresif dönem belirtileri ortaya çıkar. Cenaze manisi ise, yakın bir aile üyesinin ölümünü takiben kişide mani dönemi belirtilerinin ortaya çıkması olarak tanımlanmıştır. Sevilen kişinin kaybından çok kısa bir süre sonra ortaya çıkan cenaze manisi ile ilgili bilgiler kısıtlıdır. Konu ile ilgili az sayıda olgu bildirimi mevcuttur. Bu çalışmada babasının ölümü sonrası ilk kez mani dönemi belirtileri ile başvuran, öncesinde herhangi bir psikiyatrik hastalık ve tedavi görme öyküsü olmayan 26 yaşındaki kadın hasta literatür bulguları eşliğinde sunulmuştur. DSM-5 tanı ölçütlerine göre bipolar bozukluk (mani dönemi) tanısı ile izlenen hastanın duygudurum dönemi belirtileri ile babasının ölümü arasındaki zamansal yakınlık olması ve önceki örseleyici yaşam olaylarına bu şekilde bir tepki geliştirmemiş olması dikkat çekicidir. Bu nedenle olgunun tanısı cenaze manisi olarak değerlendirilmiştir. Olası yas tepkileri arasında nadir de olsa mani dönemi belirtilerinin görülebileceği unutulmamalıdır.",

      "abstract": "The term acute psychosis represents a group of rapid-onset and recovery psychosis. The current diagnostic criteria are not uniform and represent a heterogeneous set of psychoses. Although their form of clinical presentation may be similar, their evolution and prognosis are very different. It is very important to detect the possible factors of chronicity in order to make an early intervention and thus to diminish the negative consequences of the disease.We conducted a 2 year prospective study in 48 patients diagnosed with acute psychosis in their first admission. Data was collected on the evolution and follow-up of the patient in the Mental Health Unit and the sociodemographic and clinical factors of the psychotic index episode that could predict a change in the diagnosis during the two years follow-up were analyzed.None of the sociodemographic or clinical variables studied could predict a change in the diagnosis, except for the presence of a control delusion during the index episode. The diagnosis of schizophreniform or not otherwise specified psychotic disorders predicts an evolution towards schizophrenia or affective psychosis while a brief or substance-induced psychotic episode has a better prognosis, with a tendency to maintain the same diagnosis in the 2 years of follow-up.After 2 years of follow-up, an significant number of the patients initially diagnosed of acute psychosis evolved towards a diagnosis of schizophrenia or affective psychosis in a difficult-to-predict way.",

This leads us to refine the search for symptoms that can mask depression and not be treated properly. This is important as it is predicted that by 2020 depression will be the leading cause of disability in the world.&#x0D; Method: We review some articles that relate depression to painful symptoms.&#x0D; Results: Patients with the major depressive disorder may present, as initial complaints, multiple somatic complaints, nonspecific and especially pain, which complicates their diagnosis and sometimes leads them to not receive treatment for depression, complicating its evolution and deteriorating the quality of life.&#x0D; Conclusion: Depression can have many forms of presentation, people can complain of multiple non-specific symptoms, which do not allow a diagnosis of medical disease so it will be necessary to look for affective symptoms, investigate factors that trigger their condition to achieve an adequate diagnosis, provide the indicated medication and allow them a better quality of life.",

      "title": "Introduction and overview of offenders with intellectual disabilities",
      "abstract": "Abstract Intellectual disability (according to the DSM-5) or intellectual developmental disorder (according to the ICD-11) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social and practical domains. The term learning disability (LD) is also used, although this term shows more specifically deficits in the domain of learning. The term learning difficulties is often used for specific or generalized intellectual impairment that does not meet all of the criteria of LD. The prevalence of learning disability in prisoners is about 10%. Up to 60% of male prisoners have learning difficulties. Prevalence rates for offending behaviour in patients with LD is higher than in the general population and show a large range, from 2-40%. The main explanatory factor underlying the link between intelligence and offending is the lack of ability to manipulate abstract concepts. Poor academic performance, common in persons with LD, is also linked to offending. With regard to sexual offending, some persons with LD may not have learnt the rules that define acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Sexual offences may amount to inappropriate, impulsive expressions of emotion rather than premediated violent acts. Violent behaviour in the LD population may be due to frustration, impulsivity or poor problem solving skills. There is no significant difference in the frequency of violent or property offences between individuals with LD and those without. However, sex offences and fire-setting are frequently seen in individuals with LD. Persons with LD are vulnerable suspects and may also be disadvantaged by the criminal justice system because of a lack of appropriate support and legal representation from early stages in the process. In this introductory paper these themes will be addressed. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Abstract While sexual dysfunction is a well-known side effect of taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), in an undetermined number of patients, sexual function does not return to pre-drug baseline after stopping SSRIs. The condition is known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) and is characterised most commonly by genital numbness, pleasureless or weak orgasm, loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. This article provides a commentary on the incidence and prevalence of PSSD based on a combination of academic literature as well as clinical and research experience. A number of obstacles to quantifying the occurrence of PSSD are outlined including difficulty in designing a suitable study method. Other contextual obstacles include patient embarrassment at raising sexual concerns, the response of healthcare professionals, inability to stop an antidepressant due to withdrawal issues in a proportion of patients and patient unawareness that their sexual difficulties are linked to prior medication compounded by variability of online information and a lack of information aimed at public education. A definition of PSSD with diagnostic criteria has been published. A MedDRA code for PSSD has also been introduced, but this is yet to be adopted by regulators.",

Non-pharmacologic interventions for PMS include patient education, supportive therapy, and behavioural changes. Behavioural measures include keeping a symptom diary, getting adequate rest and exercise, and making dietary changes. Dietary supplements in women with PMS should include vitamins (A, E and B6), calcium, magnesium, multivitamins/mineral supplements and evening primrose oil. Pharmacological treatment includes anti-depressants and hormonal therapy. Surgery may be considered in severely affected patients who fail to respond to other therapies and also have significant gynaecologic problems for which surgery would be appropriate.",

Sexual dysfunction is considered by many schizophrenia patients to be more troublesome than most other symptoms and adverse drug effects [1,2] and is a major cause of poor quality of life [3], negative attitude to therapy and treatment noncompliance [2].",

      "abstract": "Lanjut usia (lansia) adalah bagian dari proses tumbuh kembang manusia. Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis. Gejala-gejala kemunduran fisik antara lain kulit mulai mengendur, timbul keriput, mulai beruban, pendengaran dan penglihatan berkurang, mudah lelah, gerakan mulai lamban dan kurang lincah masalah tersebut akan berpotensi pada masalah kesehatan baik secara umum maupun kesehatan jiwa adalah satu kesehatan jiwa yang terganggu adalah mengalami kecemasan. Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

      "abstract": "For about 40% of Americans, Insomnia is a major health issue that often leads to fatigue, reduced immunity, and dangerous driving. A good night sleep is essential for functioning and performance. It also influences mood, cognition, concentration, fatigue, and healing. Insomnia may be related to medical and psychiatric disorders, shift work, stimulants, travel, anxiety, pain, and other problems (e.g., poor sleep environment). People with insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings and daytime drowsiness) tend to rely on alcohol, drugs, and other remedies. Insomnia may reflect sleep apnea or other medical or mental health disorders that require evaluation as well as poor sleep hygiene. Insomnia can be brief, episodic or chronic. Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

      "abstract": "Physical rehabilitation (PR) is recommended following spinal cord injury to help improve and maintain muscle elasticity, joint mobility, and nerve health. It can also be used to relieve pain and improve cardiopulmonary fitness in an immobile patient. There is evidence, in human medicine, that PR plays a critical role in mental health and the psychological state of the patient. As part of the assessment phase, human physical therapists often identify psychosocial symptoms and barriers at the start of PR that ultimately may affect improvement in human patients suffering from injury and the loss of mobility. Patient psychological state plays an integral role in healing and outcome during treatment and rehabilitation. Specific interventions set to address these symptoms can better outcome. Arguably, one of the most emotionally traumatizing injuries suffered by a canine patient can be immobility secondary to spinal cord injury. Poorly understood is the role the canine cognitive state plays in the success of rehabilitation following spinal cord injury. Should breed, age, sex, physical fitness, personality, previous experiences and history or home lifestyle, affect the PR assessment of these patients? Do these factors affect eventual outcome following PR? The purpose of this manuscript is to explore psychosocial barriers encountered during injury rehabilitation in humans and determine if the similar barriers need to be considered when assessing a canine patient for spinal cord injury rehabilitation.",

CFS shares many similarities to occupational burnout, including similar symptoms, physiological abnormalities and triggers.

      "abstract": "Low back pain is a common problem affecting most adults at some point during their lifetime. At any one time, around 1 in 5 adults will report symptoms of low back pain, rising to 40% when asked if they have experienced symptoms during the previous month. The majority of people who experience an episode of low back pain will improve over time. However a sizeable proportion experience repeated episodes or recurrences, and some report continuous symptoms for many years. A wide range of factors are linked to both the onset and persistence of low back pain. Some studies have related age and gender to low back pain, but the link overall is equivocal. Work-related factors such as heavy lifting, and socio-demographic factors such as smoking and obesity have been linked with the onset of low back pain. High levels of functional impairment and the presence of pain radiating to the leg have been cited as factors associated with a poor prognosis among primary care consulters with low back pain. Other characteristics associated with both the development and the persistence of low back pain include psychological factors such as depression and anxiety and workplace factors such as job satisfaction. Low back pain places large demands on health, social and welfare systems. Further research is needed to identify practical interventions to reduce this burden from low back pain.",

      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of research has elucidated the bio-psycho-social backgrounds and clinical facts of personality disorders defined in DSM-III-IV Axis II, and has endorsed the clinical value of the diagnoses. However, the concept of personality disorder still remains diaphanous, and requires further clarification. One complication is that personality disorder can be seen from either the perspective that is a milder variant of other Axis I disorders, or that it is an abnormally exaggerated form of normal personality traits. That the disorders can be grouped according to these viewpoints indicates that there may be heterogeneity within them, while they have common characteristics: a long duration, extended areas of affected functioning, subtle and marginal severity of symptoms, and \"person-near\" nature. These features may also account for the difficulty in defining and assessing the disorder. Treatment is another important focus for discussion. Patient-therapist cooperation is essential and of itself is a difficult goal. Most failures of the therapeutic relationship lead to a variety of problems, including legal or ethical ones. Prerequisites for involuntary treatment, remedies for the risk of treatment disruption by violent acting-out and preventing malpractice are issues to be discussed. Inexorably we must return to the principle that our task is to help our patients take ultimate responsibility for decisions about their personality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has an increasing role in medical decision-making. This review of the literature aims to provide an overview on HRQoL, costs, and work disability in SS, a disease characterized by focal lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands with no therapeutics of proven immunomodulatory potential. HRQoL is markedly reduced in SS in multiple studies across many countries when compared with HRQoL in healthy controls. The reduction in HRQoL is similar to that observed in other chronic diseases such as RA, SLE, FM and, interestingly, non-SS sicca syndrome. Impaired HRQoL in SS has been found to be associated with fatigue, pain/articular involvement, ocular and oral involvement, pruritus, sexual dysfunction, impaired sleep, pulmonary manifestations, psychological dysfunction and impaired physical function. Until now, no therapeutic has been shown to improve HRQoL in an adequately powered double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. Although primary SS does not, in general, impair life expectancy and is often inappropriately considered a benign ‘nuisanvce’ disease for those patients without systemic manifestations, the associated costs and work disability are striking. This, together with the significant reduction in HRQoL, strongly argues for the development of new therapeutic approaches to manage this neglected disease.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenic psychosis is rare in patients below 15 years of age. Early diagnosis is crucial as the illness is likely to have a poor outcome: indeed, duration of untreated psychosis may exert a negative influence on the prognosis. Thus, it may be highly relevant to recognise premorbid changes of character traits, behaviour and cognitive problems which are reflected in worsening school performance. For example, some 40 to 50% of the children who later develop a psychosis will show social withdrawal, loss of interest in age-appropriate activities, peculiar or immature responsiveness, increasingly suspicious, fearful or depressive states, baseless despair, unusual somatic complaints, concentration problems, cognitive and linguistic disabilities, and peculiar motor movement disorders such as bizarre, ritualistic behaviour, mannerisms, stereotypies, echopraxia. These features are non-specific: they can but need not represent the early signs indicating later development of schizophrenia. They should be evaluated in terms of potential psychosocial, genetic and somatic pre-, peri- and postnatal risk categories. During the child's development these features may build up to constitute vulnerability and stress factors that may lead to psychotic breakdown. Early age of onset correlates with high social disability scores. Complete remission is an extremely rare event in patients with gradual-insidious onset of psychosis.",

Due to the chronic nature of CBDs, psychological complications are relatively common in these patients, which can affect treatment adherence, quality of life, and even the frequency of bleeding episodes. Chronic pain causes many psychological problems in CBDs, disrupting their social interactions, affecting all aspects of their lives, including their emotional functioning and behavior, and eventually leading to social exclusion. About one-third of patients with severe hemophilia A suffer from anxiety, 64% from depression, and 60% from other minor psychological complications such as withdrawal/depression, anxiety/depression, attention problems, and emotional problems. Anxiety, depression, and uncontrolled pain interfere with treatment adherence. For this reason, psychological interventions are needed in people with CBDs. Psychological interventions increase quality of life and treatment adherence. Therefore, early recognition of psychological complications in CBD patients may increase treatment adherence, leading to a reduction in bleeding episodes and thus an improvement in quality of life.",

Every adrenal incidentaloma requires a detailed hormonal and imaging assessment. Initial diagnosis includes radiological phenotypical evaluation (particularly in CT, or in case of contraindications — in MRI) and biochemical assessment of tumour hormonal activity (which includes cortisol circadian rhythm, salivary cortisol concentration, 24-hour urinary free-cortisol and metanephrines test, short cortisol and dexamethasone suppression test, ACTH level assessment, aldosterone and ARO concentration, adrenal androgen concentration). Each diagnostic step is associated with limitations and method imperfections. The influence of administered medications, age and concomitant diseases must be taken into account when interpreting test results. It is important to remember abovementioned factors may cause false positive or false negative test results. The following paper is to summarize the etiology of the most common diagnostic mishaps which frequently lead to misdiagnoses, an increase in patient's anxiety and, as a consequence, in the introduction of improper therapy or its discontinuation. The awareness of biochemical and imaging test limitations, and the knowledge of false positive and false negative result sources, allows for the optimisation of the diagnostic process. Simultaneously, the analyzed factors may contribute to a decrease in unnecessary and frequently repeated tests. Additionally, it may imply avoiding the costs of unjustified deep diagnostics.",

A single pathogenetic pathway does not exist for sexual disorders generally and that is also true for DE specifically. Men with DE have various bio-psychosocial-behavioral & cultural predisposing, precipitating, maintaining, and contextual factors which trigger, reinforce, or worsen the probability of DE occurring. Regardless of the degree of organic etiology present, DE is exacerbated by insufficient stimulation: an inadequate combination of \"friction and fantasy\". High frequency negative thoughts may neutralize erotic cognitions (fantasy) and subsequently delay, ameliorate, or inhibit ejaculation, while partner stimulation (friction) may prove unsatisfying. Assessment requires a thorough sexual history including inquiry into masturbatory methods. Many men with DE engage in an idiosyncratic masturbatory style, defined as a masturbation technique not easily duplicated by the partner's hand, mouth, or vagina. The clinician's most valuable diagnostic tool is a focused sex history (sex status). Differentiate DE from other sexual problems and review the conditions under which the man can ejaculate. Perceived partner attractiveness, the use of fantasy during sex, anxiety-surrounding coitus and masturbatory patterns require meticulous exploration. Identify important DE causes by juxtaposing an awareness of his cognitions and the sexual stimulation experienced during masturbation, versus a partnered experience. Assist the man in identifying behaviors that enhance immersion in excitation and minimize inhibiting thoughts, in order to reach ejaculation in his preferred manner. Discontinuing, reducing or altering masturbation is often required, which evokes patient resistance. Coaching tips are offered on how to ensure adherence to this suspension, manage resistance and facilitate success. Depending on motivation level, masturbation interruption may be compromised and negotiated. Encourage a man who continues to masturbate to alter style (\"switch hands\") and to approximate the stimulation likely to be experienced with his partner. Success will require most men to be taught to learn bodily movements and fantasies that approximate the thoughts and sensations experienced in masturbation. Fertility issues, as well as patient/partner anger are important causational factors, which often require individual and/or conjoint consultation. Drug treatment would benefit men particularly with severe DE, regardless of concomitant psychosocial-behavioral and cultural complications. When and if a safe effective medication for DE becomes available, this author's transdisciplinary perspective supports appropriate medication use when integrated with counseling. This approach emphasizes the utility of a biopsychosocial-cultural perspective combined with special attention to the patient's narrative. Treatment is patient-centered, holistic and integrates a variety of therapies as needed.",

      "title": "Сексуальные дисфункции при тревожных расстройствах",
      "abstract": "Введение. Являясь одним из широко распространенных психических заболеваний, тревожные расстройства часто сопровождаются сексуальными дисфункциями. Фармакотерапия, применяемая в лечении тревожных расстройств, в свою очередь может приводить к побочным сексуальным нарушениям. О наличии проблем в интимной сфере при обращении за психиатрической помощью сообщает лишь небольшая часть пациентов. Однако несвоевременное выявление сексуальных дисфункций может снижать приверженность терапии и ее эффективность. Материалы и методы. Статья посвящена обзору, основанному на 21 источнике, в том числе на 9 систематических обзорах и других исследованиях. Поиск данных осуществлялся по названиям, аннотациям и ключевым словам: сексуальная дисфункция, тревожное и стрессовое расстройства (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) в базах данных Elibrary и PubMed. Результаты. При тревожных расстройствах сексуальные дисфункции наблюдаются как у мужчин, так и у женщин и проявляются нарушениями всех фаз сексуальных реакций. Взаимосвязь сексуальных дисфункций с тревожными расстройствами объясняется тремя моделями. Первая, включающая причинно-следственные связи, предполагает, что корреляция между сексуальной дисфункцией и тревожными расстройствами часто является двунаправленной, причем симптомы сексуального и тревожного расстройства могут проявляться одновременно. Вторая модель предполагает наличие общего основного фактора или скрытой предиспозиции, вызывающих со временем развитие как психических, так и сексуальных расстройств, Третья модель концептуализирует сексуальные дисфункции как нарушения, не связанные с тревожными расстройствами. Заключение. На основании проведенного исследования авторами рекомендован следующий алгоритм курации пациентов, страдающих тревожными расстройствами и сексуальными нарушениями. На этапе обращения за психиатрической помощью, наряду со стандартными методами диагностики для определения выраженности психической патологии, целесообразно использовать опросники для оценки сексуальной функции. Кроме того, следует учитывать возможное негативное влияние фармакотерапии на сексуальную функцию и оценивать ее на всех этапах лечения для проведения своевременной коррекции. При выявлении сексуальных нарушений у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами с учетом клинической ситуации по возможности назначаются психотропные препараты с минимальным негативным влиянием на сексуальную функцию или без такового. При невозможности применения таких средств после достижения коррекции тревожной симптоматики могут быть снижены дозы используемых психотропных препаратов, рекомендованы перерывы в их приеме, в основном за 1-2 дня до предполагаемого сексуального контакта. При сохранении сексуальных нарушений в схему лечения в качестве антидота добавляется антидепрессант без влияния на сексуальную функцию или препараты для коррекции сексуальных нарушений – ингибиторы фосфодиэстеразы 5-го типа. Психотерапевтические мероприятия, включающие секс-терапию, являются неотъемлемой частью лечения сексуальных дисфункций у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами. Background. Anxiety disorders, being one of the widespread mental illnesses, are often accompanied by sexual dysfunctions. In turn, pharmacotherapy used in the treatment of affective disorders can lead to adverse sexual disorders. Only a small proportion of patients report having problems in the intimate sphere when seeking psychiatric help. However, untimely detection of sexual dysfunctions can reduce adherence and effectiveness of therapy. Materials and methods. The article is devoted to a review based on 21 sources, of which 9 are systematic reviews, as well as other studies. The data was searched by names, annotations and keywords: sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) in the databases Elibrary and PubMed. Results. In anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions are observed in both men and women and are manifested by violations of all phases of sexual reactions. The relationship of sexual dysfunction with anxiety disorders is explained by three models: the first, which includes causal relationships, suggests that the correlation between sexual dysfunction and anxiety disorders is often bidirectional, and the symptoms of sexual and anxiety disorders can manifest simultaneously; The second model assumes the presence of a common underlying factor, or hidden predisposition, causing the development of both mental and sexual disorders over time; the third model conceptualizes sexual dysfunctions as disorders unrelated to anxiety disorders. Conclusion. Based on the conducted research, the authors recommended the following algorithm for the supervision of patients suffering from anxiety disorders and sexual disorders: at the stage of seeking psychiatric help, along with standard diagnostic methods to determine the severity of mental pathology, it is advisable to use questionnaires to assess sexual function. In addition, the possible negative effect of pharmacotherapy on sexual function should be taken into account and evaluated at all stages of treatment in order to carry out timely correction. If sexual disorders are detected in patients with anxiety disorders, taking into account the clinical situation, psychotropic drugs with no or minimal negative effect on sexual function are prescribed, if possible. In cases where it is impossible to use such drugs, after achieving correction of anxiety symptoms, the doses of psychotropic drugs used may be reduced, interruptions in their intake, mainly 1-2 days before the alleged sexual contact. If sexual disorders persist, an antidepressant with no effect on sexual function is added to the treatment regimen as an antidote, or drugs for correcting sexual disorders – type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Psychotherapeutic measures, including sex therapy, are an integral part of the treatment of sexual dysfunctions in patients with anxiety disorders.",

Somatic symptoms of the syndrome have been subject of an extensive body of literature. In comparison, psychiatric aspects have caught relatively less attention. Psychiatric aspects of etiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic concepts are essential for evaluation of the syndrome. Application of CDC-criteria to a well known disease does not solve the nosological problem, but may define the syndrome more accurately. In this respect, issues including psychiatric comorbidity and specificity of neuropathological symptoms are discussed. Psychological variables seem to have a high predictor value for time course and outcome of the symptoms. Etiological concepts emphasize on biological or psychosocial factors. Alterations of biological parameters including immune functions, sleep regulation, and hypothalamic-pituary-adrenocortical function have been reported. The role of cultural factors has been discussed extensively. Somatic and psychological stress may result in the same clinical syndrome via psychoimmunological mechanisms. An integrated, interdisciplinary approach to further refine diagnostic criteria, understanding of etiology and development of adequate therapeutic measures seems necessary.",

      "abstract": "Peyronie's disease (PD) is characterized by the formation of palpable fibrotic tissue in the tunica albuginea of the penis. It is thought to manifest in response to recurrent microtrauma during erection in those with risk factors that may include wound-healing disorders. The initial stage of PD is thought to last from 6 to 18 months, and it is characterized by an inflammatory period with pain in approximately one-third of men. This initial phase is followed by a chronic phase when pain typically resolves and the deformity stabilizes with no additional plaque development. PD has been reported to develop in up to 9% of adult males according to published literature, but the incidence may be even higher. The most frequently affected age group is men between 50 and 59 years. Because of the associated penile deformity and effect on sexual relations, psychosocial distress is very common in those with PD. It has been reported to negatively affect self-image, sexual activity, intimacy, and mood, and it is often associated with depression and erectile dysfunction (ED). At this time, nonsurgical treatments are unreliable and have variable efficacy, and surgical treatments are reserved for those with disabling disfigurement. Moreover, surgery may result in loss of penile length and ED, and there are only a few physicians in the United States that perform such surgeries. There is a great need to increase awareness of PD in patients and general practitioners, to elucidate the pathogenesis of PD, and for the development of novel treatments for this disfiguring disease.",

      "title": "Female sexuality in multiple sclerosis: the multidimensional nature of the problem and the intervention",
      "abstract": "Female sexual functioning is a complex process involving physiological, psychosocial and interpersonal factors. Sexual dysfunction (SD) is frequent (40-74%) among women with multiple sclerosis (MS), reflecting neurological dysfunction, psychological factors, depression, side effects of medications and physical manifestations of the disease, such as fatigue and muscle weakness. A conceptual model for sexual problems in MS characterizes three levels. Primary SD includes impaired libido, lubrication, and orgasm. Secondary SD is composed of limiting sexual expressions due to physical manifestations. Tertiary SD results from psychological, emotional, social, and cultural aspects. Sexual problems cause distress and may affect the family bond. Practical suggestions on initiation of discussion of sexual issues for MS patients are included in this review. Assessment and treatment of sexual problems should combine medical and psychosexual approaches and begin early after MS diagnosis. Intervention can be done by recognizing sexual needs, educating and providing information, by letting patients express their difficulties and referring them to specialists and other information resources.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social, or professional live; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.Although symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from moodiness in the 18th century to premenstrual tension in the early part of 19th century to finally premenstrual in the 1950s. While some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, syndrome (PMS) includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder (LLDD), now known as dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment.Currently, PMDD is listed in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the criteria for diagnosis as follows:Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11 symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge” Marked affective lability Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased interpersonal conflicts Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work, school, friends, and hobbies) Subjective sense of difficulty in concentrating Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings Hypersomnia or insomnia A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B - symptoms severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or scholastic functioning.Criterion C - symptoms discretely related to the menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed on those of these disorders).Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation.Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life detriments, work-productivity losses, and incur greater healthcare costs than women with no or only mild symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The various causes of tremor are considered by order of prevalence in the elderly. 1) Essential tremor occurs in 5% of the population beyond 65 years of age. It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

      "title": "Psyche, personality and gut functions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

      "title": "A Psychopathological Consideration on the Neurotic Depersonalization",
      "abstract": "The author has tried a life-historical analysis on thirty cases of neurotic depersonalization in regard to the psychogenesis. At the same time, the ego structure in these patients has been discussed.1) The ability of estimation of love in these patients was seriously twisted as they had been loved too much or too little in their infancy. The character features such as peculiar sensitiveness in interpersonal relationship, monopolistic tendency, strong need for might, self-assertion, selfishness, etc. were all attribuable to the various factors in their infantile life-history. In common to the neurotics, the frustration tolerance (especially for love) was also extremely faible and the socialization of personality was pretty insufficient in these patients. This fact means the elevated susceptibility to affective frustrations in the future.2) The depersonalization appears always after the intense inner tension for certain period, which signifies the consumption of psychological force ( Janet). The abrupt abasement of psychological tension is motivated by the sudden affective deprivation or by the strong menaces to or the sudden interruption of the tendency of self-enlargement in such circumstances. The depersonalization is caused by the reduction of the secondary action ( Janet) which is brought about by the abasement of psychological tension. At the same time, the state completely narcissistic would develop in such conditions just mentioned. On the contrary, the displacement of these motives and the resolution of the inner tension will play an important role in the disparition of the depersonalization symptoms.3) Last of all, the depersonalization begins, according to Federn, whenever the outer ego-boundary becomes weak and consequently the egotized data concerned lose the energy cathexes. This weakening of the outer ego-boundary results, in my opinion, from the ego weakness which is attribuable to constitutional factors in one hand and to the intense inner tension for certain period on the other. In the psychogenesis of depersonalization, Federn emphasized the mechanism of projection of this primary ego disturbance to the outer objects. From the psychoanlytic point of view, the reduction of libido and mortido components in the ego cathexes to objects is the result of the relative increase of medial ego cathexes, which is the most primitive form of ego libido (Federn), caused by the lifehistorically developped narcissism. The organs and the functions to which libido is mostly invested in healthy state are influenced most seriously in the deprsonalized patients. Finally, it is relatively strengthened by the weakening of tile inner ego-boundary.",

Unfortunately, the areas of life that have been ignored may be those that are most important to individuals, and may also be the most sensitive to the first signs of developing disability. The ability to perform valued life activities, the wide range of activities that individuals find meaningful or pleasurable above and beyond activities that are necessary for survival or self-sufficiency, has strong links to psychological well-being - in some cases, stronger links than functional limitations and disability in basic activities of daily living. A broader assessment of disability has great potential for interrupting the disablement and distress process, thereby improving the quality of life of individuals with arthritis. Assessment of the effects of arthritis, pain, or other chronic health conditions should expand beyond assessment of functional limitations and disability in basic activities to include assessment of disability in advanced, valued activities.",

There are many potential causes of transient distress in palliative care, including insensitive comments, long waits in clinical departments, and disease symptoms. Such potential causes of distress should be an important focus of attention in everyday nursing practice, because the disruption and worry they cause is often unnecessary. The wish to continue living is a potent life force that is present in most people until the moment of death, and fear of death grows as death approaches. Antianxiety medication with long-acting benzodiazepines or antidepressants can also be helpful for very distressed people. Many nurses also feel they have little time to assess and address people's concerns comprehensively.",

      "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common sexual dysfunction in men that is characterized by a short time to ejaculation, and a lack of control over ejaculation, and is associated with distress for men and their partners. Lack of knowledge about the aetiology of PE and lack of approved treatments might contribute to its under-diagnosis and under-treatment. The organic factors involved in PE are not well understood but serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is important at the level of the central nervous system in the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in ejaculation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (paroxetine, fluoxetine and sertraline) and the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine increase ejaculatory control and delay ejaculation in men with PE, suggesting that pharmacological intervention might be useful for PE. These agents are intended for chronic dosing for treating psychiatric disorders because of their pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic activity, which might result in limitations when used for treating PE. Indeed, these properties might limit the utility of these drugs, whether administered on-demand or chronically, for the episodic treatment requirements of PE. Elevated synaptic 5-HT levels achieved with acute SSRI treatment might be self-limiting because of activation of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, and chronic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor desensitization might contribute to an increase in side-effects and withdrawal symptoms. Short-acting SSRIs such as dapoxetine, currently under development for the on-demand treatment of PE, might circumvent these limitations and offer better ejaculatory control and sexual satisfaction for men with PE. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors have also been evaluated for treating PE, as have topical anaesthetics and the narcotic analgesic tramadol.",

MAO inhibitors may also ameliorate depression-related sexual dysfunction. These drugs also improve sperm count and sperm motility and may have a clinical use in moderate oligospermia. Stimulant drugs have been linked to a wide variety of sexual effects. Most dramatic is the increase in sexual arousal reported by many stimulant users. Increases in sexual activity and sexual perversion have both been related to stimulant use. Due to the high rate of pre-drug sexual aberration and the non-specific nature of stimulant arousal, caution should be exercised in postulating a direct effect on sexuality by stimulant drugs.",

It often comes along with a significant negative impact on educational, occupational and social outcomes in adults. It is important to pay particular attention to the screening of this neuropsychiatric disorder. Indeed, numerous controlled studies have clearly established the effectiveness of psychostimulants, and to a lesser extent of some antidepressants, in the treatment of adult ADHD. The pharmacological treatment of this disorder should aim to control symptoms and limit the long-term consequences of dysfunctional behaviours.",

HPD is marked by flamboyant, shallow, dysregulated emotional style, with attention-seeking behaviors. Patients rarely present for evaluation on their own, as many patients do not perceive that their behavior negatively affects their relationships or livelihood. There is a large body of literature that describes the disorder via a psychodynamic and psychoanalytic lens. However, there are few resources that focus on the treatment of the disorder by itself; rather, it is often discussed as a phenomenon embedded within or comorbid to additional diagnoses. Like many other personality disorders, it is thought to be a mosaic of genetic and environmental factors. These patients may be challenging to treat because of their limited insight, an inability to provide earnest feedback about their internal states, seductive and sexualized behaviors, and a distracting presentation meant to serve the patient’s needs rather than resolve behavioral, interpersonal, or emotional issues.",

      "abstract": "Controversy exists over puberty suppression (PS) in adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD). PS is preferentially achieved with GnRH analogues. By preventing the development of secondary sex characteristics, PS may improve psychological functioning, well-being, quality of life, emotional and behavioral (especially internalizing) problems and depressive symptoms, thus decreasing suicidality. PS can also extend the diagnostic period and give transgender adolescents time to explore their gender identity. GnRHa may also decrease the need for feminization/masculinization surgery. However, 2-year treatment with GnRHa may result in bone mass accrual retardation (decrease in BMD/BMAD z-scores), growth velocity deceleration (decrease in height SDS), increase in fat mass, temporary pause in oocyte/sperm maturation. The most common side effects of GnRHa are hot flashes, mood fluctuations, fatigue and headache. They are usually mild and rarely lead to GnRHa discontinuation. Based on current scientific evidence, PS could be recommended to adolescents who meet the diagnostic criteria of gender incongruence (by DSM-5 and/or ICD-11) and have long-lasting intense GD, which aggravates with puberty onset. Before initiating PS, possible mental issues should be addressed and informed consent (by the adolescent/caregiver) should be given, after counseling on probable reproductive effects of GnRHa. GnRHa can only be started after the adolescent has entered Tanner stage 2. Nevertheless, published studies are inadequate in number, small in size, uncontrolled and relatively short-term, so that it is difficult to draw safe conclusions on efficacy and safety of GnRHa. Large long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to expand knowledge on this controversial issue and elucidate the benefit and risks of PS.",

      "abstract": "In order to suggest therapy modifications with the aim of diminishing the risk of therapy-induced long-term distressful symptoms in cancer survivors, data are needed relating details of therapy to the long-term symptom situation. In this article, the concepts and means used to assess the latter while developing the Radiumhemmet scale for symptom assessment are described. The focus is on the subjective long-term situation, and symptoms as a perceived abnormality are defined. For conceptual clarity, one symptom at a time is considered, excluding scales in which items are summarized. Moreover, measures of disease occurrence in the population are translated (epidemiologically) into measures of symptom occurrence in an individual. Nature distinguishes one long-term symptom from another. Occurrence of a symptom in an individual is measured by an incidence (e.g. number of defecations per week) or prevalence rate (e.g. urinations with involuntary cessation divided by the total number of urinations). Any scale expressing symptom intensity is arbitrary, be it 'verbal' (no/little/moderate/much pain) or visual (analogue or with integers). A time period describes symptom duration. The relevance of a symptom to emotions and social activities, sometimes cited as the associated symptom-induced distress, is a separate issue from symptom occurrence, intensity, and duration.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

This symptomatology presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician. Its cause may be primarily psychiatric or secondary to a somatic or neurological disorder. In this article, the case of an elderly woman presenting with typical partition delusions (the belief that something or someone exerts influence through impermeable structures) is described. This case illustrates the difficult differential diagnosis between primary psychiatric disorders and neurocognitive disorders with late-onset psychotic symptoms, as well as the discussion concerning the nosological classification of schizophrenia in the elderly population. At the end of the 20th century, the term ‘very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis’ was introduced for schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms developing after the age of 60. To this day, the validity of the existence and the etiology of this subgroup of schizophrenia remain a matter of debate. Psychosocial interventions are the first step in the treatment of late-onset psychotic symptoms. The use of antipsychotics is reserved for persistent, severe and debilitating symptoms because of the many side effects in the elderly population. However, the symptoms are often intrusive and have a negative impact on general functioning, so that drug treatment is regularly used in clinical practice.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico.

O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Embora o transtorno bipolar (TB) ocorra quase igualmente em ambos os sexos, a fenomenologia e o curso da doença diferem no homem e na mulher. No entanto, há evidências de que mulheres bipolares, mais que os homens, apresentariam início mais tardio (em especial na quinta década de vida), ciclagem rápida, mais episódios depressivos, mais mania disfórica que eufórica, estados mistos e evolução do tipo bipolar II, ainda que os achados nem sempre sejam consistentes. Embora o risco de comorbidades no TB inclua, para ambos os gêneros, abuso de álcool e drogas, homens bipolares teriam maior probabilidade de ser alcoolistas, não procurar tratamento e de se suicidar. Hipóteses sugeridas para explicar tais diferenças variam daquelas centradas em aspectos culturais ou psicológicos para as que focalizam os sistemas hormonais, como os esteróides gonadais ou o eixo tireoidiano, e até mesmo a anatomia cerebral. A influência do ciclo reprodutivo (ciclo menstrual, gravidez e menopausa) sobre as opções terapêuticas no tratamento do TB é apresentada na última parte desta revisão.",

Method: Eighty-five women, aged 18–65 years, were treated and monitored over the course of 4 years. Results: Vaginismus affects a woman’s life on many levels, bringing with it physical pain, emotional anguish, and the sense of failure and inadequacy. Sexual dysfunctions are an inevitable outcome, as are penetration difficulties apparent in undergoing a pelvic examination, inserting a tampon, and having intercourse. Vaginismus affects female adolescents and women indiscriminately, across cultural, religious, and professional barriers. Vaginismus may manifest itself as mild, with some anxiety, or as severe, with devastating panic attacks. The etiology is complex and varied and requires clinical proficiency to achieve a resolution. Successful intervention must be rendered through the body and the mind to ensure a complete resolution. Conclusion: A team approach to etiology and management is required to fully address the components of the condition and to bring about a cure.",

      "title": "Clinical and Pathophysiological Aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychological symptoms, then a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] should be considered, according to the Centers for Disease Control case definition [1994]. Actually, the diagnosis of CFS is only a clinical diagnosis, since laboratory tests are only useful to identify and/or exclude alternative diseases with a well defined etiology, which may explain the same symptoms. The CFS onset is explained by different etiopathogenetic hypotheses: toxic exposure well documented in some cases [e.g., ciguatera poisoning, workers exposure to solvents and other chemicals], infectious agents [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses, coxsackievirus, etc.], immunologic factors [CFS = Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome-CFIDS], neuroendocrine alterations [significant dysfunction of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis has been observed in CFS patients]. Also the psychiatric hypothesis is still credited by CFS researchers. However, a concurrent diagnosis of major depression should exclude a diagnosis of CFS according to the last case definition. Furthermore the depressive syndrome often observed in CFS patients is often secondary to the malaise and disability. Although the various pathogenetic hypotheses are not necessarily in contrast, it seems more likely that CFS is a heterogeneous disease, probably multifactorial, or that CFS includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. Among the several questions which are still unexplained there is one of remarkable importance about the pathogenetic substrate of CFS symptoms and particularly of “fatigue.” Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the fatigue or the other neuromuscular symptoms [e.g., myalgia] have a central or a peripheral origin. Most of the alterations described so far in CFS point out a clinical and a functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, our own observations at the Reference Center for CFS Study of Chieti University indicate the existence of peripheral alterations [neuromuscular] and this supports the theory about a heterogeneity of the CFSs.",

      "abstract": "Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is characterized by irresponsibility, aggression, criminality, and, in some, a lack of conscience. Recognized for over 200 years, ASPD is associated with domestic violence, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, and excess health care use. ASPD is highly prevalent, and most affected individuals are men. ASPD has its onset in childhood or adolescence, when it may be diagnosed as a disruptive behavior disorder or conduct disorder. Not diagnosed until age 18, ASPD peaks in severity in the late teens or early 20s. It is lifelong for most persons, although the trend is toward improvement in those individuals with an adolescent onset and a prominent antisocial lifestyle. Those who do best have milder syndromes, are married/partnered, have stable jobs, and are older. ASPD is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some antisocial persons have shown functional abnormalities in limbic structures and the frontotemporal cortex, portions of the brain that control judgment and regulate impulses. There are no effective pharmacologic treatments, but some antisocial persons receive off-label medication to dampen aggressive tendencies and curb impulsivity. Psychotropic medication is also used to treat comorbid syndromes (e.g., major depression). Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be helpful in mild cases. Family and couples therapies may be important for antisocial persons who are partnered or have offspring. This review contains 1 figure, 2 tables, and 99 references.

      "title": "Depressão puerperal e seu difícil diagnóstico",
      "abstract": "Introdução: O parto é um processo difícil e exaustivo, e no puerpério, a mulher passa por um período de grande vulnerabilidade, associado a intensas alterações físicas e emocionais. A depressão pós-parto ocorre mais comumente 6 semanas após o parto, em cerca de 6,5% a 20% das mulheres. Embora as mulheres que sofrem de tristeza pós-parto tendem a se recuperar rapidamente, a depressão puerperal tende a durar mais tempo e afeta gravemente a capacidade das mulheres de retornar às funções normais. Por ser definida como um transtorno depressivo maior, exigem critérios de diagnóstico, como sintomas de humor deprimido ou a perda de interesse ou prazer nas atividades presentes por pelo menos duas semanas. Além disso, podem estar presentes distúrbios do sono, distúrbios do apetite, perda de energia, sentimentos de inutilidade ou culpa, diminuição da concentração e pensamentos suicidas. O diagnóstico e o tratamento da depressão pós-parto são desafiadores, isso porque as alterações nos padrões de sono e no apetite, além da fadiga excessiva, são rotina para as mulheres após o parto, e nem todo tratamento trará benefícios à paciente. Objetivo: O presente trabalho tem como objetivo evidenciar a importância e o diagnóstico da depressão puerperal. Métodos: Para a confecção desta revisão de literatura, foi realizada pesquisa nas bases de dados Medical Literature Analysis and Retrievel System Online (MEDLINE), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) e Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), além de documentos oficiais do Ministério da Saúde. Na busca, foram utilizadas as palavras-chave “depressão puerperal”, “gestação” e “transtornos psiquiátricos”. Foram aplicados os filtros “revisão bibliografica” e “relato de caso”. A amostra de estudo foi composta por textos em português e inglês com publicação no intervalo entre os anos de 2020 e 2024. Aplicando-se esses critérios, 20 artigos foram pesquisados, dos quais 8 deles foram selecionados. Resultados: Os resultados destacam a prevalência significativa da depressão puerperal em todo o mundo, bem como fatores de risco conhecidos, como história prévia de transtornos mentais, falta de apoio social, eventos estressantes durante a gestação e parto complicado. Além disso, as abordagens de triagem e diagnóstico; intervenções terapêuticas, incluindo psicoterapia e farmacoterapia; e medidas preventivas para reduzir o impacto da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil ainda são controversas e precisam ser individualizadas de acordo com cada paciente. Conclusões: A depressão puerperal é uma condição que tem se tornado cada vez mais comum e que requer atenção cuidadosa por parte dos profissionais de saúde. Estratégias de triagem eficazes, intervenções terapêuticas baseadas em evidências e apoio contínuo são fundamentais para identificar e tratar adequadamente mulheres afetadas por essa condição. Além disso, políticas de saúde pública que promovam o acesso equitativo a cuidados de saúde mental perinatais são essenciais para mitigar os efeitos adversos da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil.",

It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

      "title": "Depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant women: A community-based study",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pregnancy is supposed to be a time of emotional well-being in a woman's life, but for many women, this is a time of confusion, fear, sadness, anxiety, stress, and even depression. Mental health, in spite of being an important component of reproductive health, is often neglected. Moreover, in the absence of systematic screening, most antenatal mental disorders are not detected. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, between 14% and 23% of women will struggle with some symptoms of depression during pregnancy.[1] Depression in pregnancy may diminish one's capacity for self-care, precipitating inadequate nutrition, drug or alcohol abuse, and poor antenatal clinic attendance, all of which may compromise a woman's physical and mental health, may reduce optimal fetal monitoring, and might restrict the growth and development of the fetus. Performing antenatal screening is justified and seems reasonable since most postnatal depressive disorders begin during or before pregnancy. Anxiety during pregnancy has been found to be associated with depression as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Various studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal stress and cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problem in a child. An in-depth community-based query has to be made during the antenatal period as most of the past studies have been hospital-based and postnatal centric. The importance of mental health in pregnancy can be emphasized by the fact that even the best obstetric care cannot give a desirable outcome of the pregnancy if the mental health issues of the expectant mother are not addressed at the right time and in the right manner. To generate local evidence to fill up the knowledge gap about the mental health problems faced by the antenatal females and to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in antenatal females, a cross-sectional community-based descriptive enquiry was conducted from January to October 2014 in Ghazipur, an urbanized village in East Delhi which is the field practice area of our institute. One hundred and sixty-five antenatal women who gave consent to participate in the study and residing in the area for 6 months or more were included in the study. The study participants who needed immediate medical attention and/or participant with chronic mental illness were not included in the study. The tool used for the study included the depression, anxiety, stress scale. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 25.5%, 63%, and 23%, respectively. Figure 1 shows the distribution of depression, anxiety, and stress based on severity.Figure 1: Severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among pregnant females (n = 165)The increased vulnerability for mental illness in pregnancy can be explained by the \"Biopsychosocial Model,\"[2] which integrates the biological, psychological, and social factors to explain the occurrence of mental illness. Pregnant females have increased biological vulnerability due to the hormonal maladjustment, psychological vulnerability due to apprehension for new life of motherhood, and social vulnerability due to the added demands of family support and care during this critical phase of her life. More community-based studies need to be done to increase the database of similar bigger epidemiological studies to be conducted in different social and cultural settings in India. Our study provided a quantitative descriptive enquiry, but some sensitive issues can be picked up only by qualitative study such as in-depth interviews or focus group discussion. There is now a need to move toward quality comprehensive antenatal services. The findings of our study indicate the need to incorporate mental health components in RCH (Reproductive & Child health) program. At the present junction, universal screening may not be a suitable strategy, but surely, it is a desirable and achievable goal in the future. Longitudinal prospective research is needed to establish the temporality of the onset of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnancy. A control group of nonpregnant women with a similar sociodemographic profile may be a good estimate of the actual burden of mental health morbidities in pregnancy. Repeated probing on several occasions can build up the rapport and gain the confidence of the victim, so antenatal care visits are an ideal option as there are multiple chances of contact with the healthcare delivery system. Our study provided scoping bit in the base of these hitherto less explored and less examined and underappreciated issues related to pregnancies, on which further studies can be planned on a larger constructive framework and better-resourced methodologies.

      "title": "Combined Exercise Programmes for Improving the Mood and Mental Health of Older People With Mild Cognitive Impairment",
      "abstract": "To Editor, Regular exercise and/or physical activity have long been recognised for their numerous benefits on physical health, but their impact on mental health and mood, particularly in older people experiencing cognitive decline, is equally profound. Cognitive decline, which may manifest as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or progress to conditions like Alzheimer's disease, is often accompanied by mood disturbances such as depression, anxiety and irritability (Ismail et al. 2018). Engaging in consistent physical activity has been shown to mitigate these issues, offering both physiological and psychological benefits that enhance overall quality of life (Kim and Lim 2022). Depression and anxiety are common symptoms in older people with cognitive decline. These mood disorders can worsen cognitive symptoms, creating a vicious cycle of poor mental and emotional health, and chronic stress is a significant risk factor for both cognitive decline and mental health in older people. Regular exercise and/or physical activity act as a natural stress reliever by lowering levels of cortisol, the body's main stress hormone, and physical activity also helps manage emotional issues associated with cognitive impairment by providing a constructive outlet for tension and frustration (Smyth et al. 2020; Quinn et al. 2016). The effectiveness of regular exercise and/or physical activity in improving mood and mental health depends on its consistency and suitability for the individual. Older people with cognitive decline may have physical limitations or comorbid conditions that require tailored exercise programmes. Consistency is crucial for reaping the mental health benefits of exercise and/or physical activity. Even moderate physical activity—as little as five 30-min bouts of moderate intensity or three 25-min bouts of vigorous intensity per week—can lead to noticeable improvements in mood and cognitive function. Regular exercise and/or physical activity are powerful tools for improving mood and mental health in older people experiencing cognitive decline. Through physiological mechanisms such as increased neuroplasticity and reduced inflammation, as well as psychological benefits such as stress reduction and enhanced social connections, exercise addresses multiple dimensions of mental well-being (Lee et al. 2021). By incorporating consistent and individualised physical activity into their lives, older people with cognitive decline can experience significant improvements in mood, resilience and overall quality of life. This underscores the importance of promoting exercise as a key component of holistic care for this vulnerable population.

      "abstract": "• I reviewed studies examining the hypothesis that life events may precipitate a depressive disorder. Although some contradictory results exist, the majority of studies demonstrate that depressed patients experience more stressful events in the months that precede the onset of their disorder than do normal controls or schizophrenics. In calculating relative risk figures, it seems that depressive risk is increased by a factor of about 5 or 6 for the six months after an event. Certain events, such as undesirable, loss, or severely threatening events, are particularly likely to precede a depression. These results suggest that stressful events can bring about depressive episodes, but most of the evidence that supports this conclusion emanates from retrospective studies, and corroborating prospective studies are definitely needed. Furthermore, not all depressives report precipitating events, so other causal factors are also operative.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

      "abstract": "Introduction Body image is a person’s perception of his/her physical appearance. There is little relation between the actual appearance and sense of attractiveness. Great physical appearance doesn’t guarantee a positive body image, or does lacking natural beauty lead to a negative body image. In fact, beauty doesn’t properly reflect one’s feelings of body image; it depends on one’s appearance. There are relations between body image and feeling, thinking and acting in particular conditions (1). One of the key features of the ‘Body Dysmorphic Disorder’ (BDD) definition is excessive preoccupation with slight or imagined defect in body appearance (2). BDD has the worst outcome of all the body image disorders (3). Since BDD has a negative impact on quality of life (4) screening BDD patients in clinical settings seems important (5). Sense of body image may put an adolescent’s physical health at risk (6). However, physical concerns don't necessarily reflect body dysmorphic disorder (7). In addition, there are high numbers of BDD patients that have extreme body image dissatisfaction (8). The main feature of BDD is excessive attention to negative body image. Subsequently, negative evaluation of images can lead to rumination, mood changes and compulsive behaviors (3). Self-worth based upon appearance (9) and poor body image is important in BDD (10). The feeling of attractiveness (11) and body image can influence BDD symptoms (12). BDD patients have high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts and also completed suicide attempts (13). Since this disorder can have a devastating effect on the quality of a person's life, it seems necessary to identify it at an early stage (14). Compared to men, women are more likely to undergo cosmetic surgery. Lack of body satisfaction can predict cosmetic surgery. Experience of cosmetic surgery among family or friends can increase the rate of cosmetic surgery in women. Media has no effect on the rate of cosmetic surgery",

Additionally, insomnia was related to decreased immune functioning. The data were inconclusive regarding insomnia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but sleep medication use was predictive of mortality. These results must be tempered with the knowledge that significant weaknesses existed in the studies reviewed. The main weaknesses were inadequate definition of insomnia and inadequate control for alternative explanations.

Sleep quality is an important part of a person's overall health. Sleep problems can be associated with decreased physical and mental health, limitations in daily activities, cognitive impairment. Given these consequences, there is a need for a better understanding of the factors associated with the improvement and deterioration of sleep quality. The relevance of this problem in the context of modern research. The results of an empirical study that reveals the relationship between sleep quality and some psychological factors are highlighted. It was found that the average score of sleep quality indicates unsatisfactory sleep quality. It was found that there are significant differences between the groups of subjects with satisfactory and unsatisfactory indicators of the overall score of sleep quality on the scales of neuroticism and depression. In people who are dissatisfied with the quality of sleep, the level of neuroticism is close to high and there is moderate depression. The relationships between sleep quality indicators and psychological factors have been identified, and their features have been analyzed. In general, these relationships demonstrate: emotional inadequacy does not contribute to a better subjective quality of sleep; depressive or anxious symptoms, emotional instability do not contribute to rapid falling asleep, but contribute to sleep disorders and daytime dysfunction; anxious characteristics affect the reduction of sleep time.",

For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep (1). Contrary to popular belief, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most common causes of insomnia (1). In fact, untreated insomnia, itself, is a risk factor for the subsequent development of clinical depression and psychiatric distress (2).",

They can be understood as a way to indicate suffering or to get attention and sometimes as a mean to regain self-esteem. There is little quantitative change in pain associated psychopathology and coping mechanisms in the elderly as compared to younger patients. However, qualitative changes are identified. The high degree of association between chronic pain and depression remains throughout the age span. However, age variations in the expression of psychological distress are to be noted. Elderly patients have a tendency to make a greater use of somatic complaints and avoid the expression of the emotional dimension of distress. This clinical particularity is discussed. Special attention should be paid to the multidimensional aspects of pain com- plaints in the elderly in order not to underestimate its affective components.",

      "abstract": "There are three major dimensional aspects with regard to associations between substance-related disorders (SRD) and psychosocial factors. They are religious/spiritual, job-related, and symptomatic (clinical) factors, each of which strongly affects or modifies the quality of life among SRD patients. Those factors construct a stratum in which each factor correlates with the other. The most fundamental factors are religious/spiritual, and based on their sense of value and morality, legal regulations on relevant substances are enforced. Such legal regulations directly stipulate job environments, in other words, social restriction as the second dimension of psychosocial factors among SRD patients. That is, illicit drug use results in dismissals and difficulty in obtaining new jobs. Since unemployment status is strongly associated with SRD, a vicious cycle is formed between SRD and unemployment. Catastrophic events such as suicide often occur as a result of such negative spiral. Due to these social factors related to substances, somatic symptoms, the final signs directly connected to medical treatments and revealed by SRD patients, might be seriously biased. Such somatic symptoms can be regarded as the third dimension of psychosocial factors surrounding SRD. Negative emotions such as stigmas, prejudices, or feelings of shame concerning one’s mental disorder (including SRD) might prevent patients from showing apparent mental symptoms associated with SRD. Because negative emotions possibly arise on the basis of cultural backgrounds, it is important to take into account the effects of such factors when evaluating and studying the associations between somatic symptoms and SRD. The most important issue for the rectification of health inequality among SRD patients is to sweep away discriminations and prejudices against SRD, but this is difficult since such negative emotions are likely to take root in a religious/spiritual context.",

      "title": "La calidad de vida de los pacientes con dolor crónico y criterios de fragilidad en atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Introduccion El dolor cronico es una experiencia angustiosa asociada con dano tisular real o potencial con componentes sensitivos, emocionales, cognitivos y sociales. En los adultos mayores pueden producirse cambios en el sistema inhibitorio descendente que lleven a una capacidad disminuida del organismo para responder al estres del dolor persistente. Su tratamiento requiere de un cuidadoso manejo farmacologico, debido a los cambios fisiologicos del envejecimiento y a las posibles interacciones, sin olvidar la importancia del tratamiento no farmacologico. El mantenimiento de la calidad de vida y de la funcion son los principales objetivos del tratamiento del dolor. \nLa fragilidad es otra situacion que impacta directamente sobre la calidad de vida y el mantenimiento de la independencia de la persona mayor. Es un estado en el que existe un descenso de las reservas funcionales que llevan a un estado de vulnerabilidad con riesgo de desenlaces adversos. Existen multiples factores que caracterizan la fragilidad de una persona mayor, entre ellos uno de los mas relevantes es la sarcopenia, definida como una perdida de masa y fuerza muscular. La evaluacion de la fragilidad requiere de cuestionarios que evaluen la situacion fisica, nutricional y funcional del anciano. Debido a sus consecuencias, las principales son el desarrollo de discapacidad y dependencia y el aumento del riesgo de caidas, se requiere un manejo cuidadoso, con especial vigilancia a la alimentacion, actividad fisica, deterioro funcional y funcion cognitiva para la prevencion y el tratamiento de la fragilidad. \nLa realizacion de actividad fisica ha sido identificada como un tratamiento eficaz para revertir y prevenir la fragilidad. Ademas de reportar beneficios para los pacientes con dolor cronico y con otras patologias cardiovasculares o metabolicas. No realizar actividad fisica de forma habitual podria incrementar el riesgo de caidas, el desarrollo de discapacidad y el aislamiento social. La realizacion de programas de actividad fisica multicomponente son las principales intervenciones para el manejo de fragilidad, y tambien han demostrado beneficioso para personas con dolor cronico. \nObjetivos Analizar la relacion entre el dolor cronico y la situacion de fragilidad y evaluar la efectividad de una intervencion educativa estructurada de ejercicio fisico multicomponente en personas mayores pre-fragiles con dolor cronico en Atencion Primaria de Salud. \nMetodologia Para responder a los objetivos se han realizado tres estudios con diferentes metodologias: Estudio 1: Se ha realizado una revision sistematica sobre estudios cuantitativos realizados en adultos mayores de 60 anos que residen en la comunidad y que recogen como resultado el dolor cronico no oncologico. La busqueda se realizo en las siguientes bases de datos. Pubmed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library Plus, Scielo, LILACS y JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports con el fin de identificar la evidencia descrita en la literatura cientifica sobre la prevalencia del dolor en adultos mayores fragiles y si el dolor cronico es un predictor de la fragilidad. \nEstudio 2: Se realizo un estudio observacional transversal descriptivo en Atencion Primaria sobre personas con edad ≥ 65 anos y dolor cronico no oncologico de mas de 3 meses de evolucion que fueran independientes y no se encontraran institucionalizados. Se evaluo su nivel de fragilidad mediante el cuestionario de fragilidad para Atencion Primaria SHARE-FI y la relacion del nivel de fragilidad con otras variables como intensidad del dolor, edad, sexo, frecuentacion a las consultas del centro de salud, farmacos prescritos y comorbilidades. \nEstudio 3: Se realizo un Ensayo Clinico Aleatorizado con los pacientes identificados como pre-fragiles en el estudio observacional transversal anterior. Se analizo el impacto de participar en un programa de educacion para la salud basado en un programa de actividad fisica multicomponente comparado con la practica habitual en la calidad de vida, intensidad del dolor, funcion fisica y depresion de los participantes. \nResultados Estudio 1: La revision sistematica de la literatura muestra que el dolor cronico es mas frecuente entre las personas fragiles, con una prevalencia de fragilidad entre los pacientes con dolor cronico en torno al 45% que puede llegar a mas del 70%. Ademas, el dolor cronico actua como predictor de la fragilidad y las personas que sufren dolor de mayor intensidad o interferencia muestran peores niveles de fragilidad. \nEstudio 2: Entre los pacientes mayores con dolor cronico identificados, el 20,1% son fragiles, el 38,3 pre-fragiles y el 41,6% no fragiles. La intensidad de dolor es forma estadisticamente significativa superior entre los pacientes fragiles respecto a los pre-fragiles y entre los pre-fragiles respecto a los no fragiles (p=0). La Odds Ratio (OR) para ser clasificado como fragil o pre-fragil teniendo un dolor de moderada o elevada intensidad fue 4,21 (95% IC = 2,11-8,40). La edad ≥ 75 anos (OR: 3,41 95% IC = 1,74-6,68) y el sexo femenino (OR: 4,62 95% IC = 2,23-9,59) tambien se relacionaron con ser clasificado como fragil o pre-fragil. Ademas la frecuentacion a consultas medicas y de enfermeria fue mucho mayor en los pacientes fragiles y pre-fragiles que en los no fragiles. \nEstudio 3: Se reclutaron 32 participantes pre-fragiles con dolor cronico (17 en el grupo intervencion y 15 en el grupo control). Los participantes que recibieron una intervencion de actividad fisica multicomponente mostraron mejoras en la calidad de vida respecto al grupo control medida mediante el indice de utilidades del cuestionario EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) tras la intervencion, diferencia de medias= -0,19 (95%IC = -0,33- -0,04; p=,02) y tras tres meses de seguimiento, diferencia de medias= -0,21 (95%IC =-0,37- -0,05; p=,01). Tambien se encontraron mejoras estadisticamente significativas intra grupo en el grupo intervencion en la funcion fisica medida con el Short Physical Performance Battery (p=,01), la Escala Visual Analogica del cuestionario EQ-5D (p=,04) y la intensidad del dolor medida con una Escala Visual Analogica (p=0). \nConclusiones La fragilidad es un problema de salud frecuente en personas que sufren dolor cronico. Tambien es mas frecuente en mujeres y personas de mayor edad. Presentar dolor de mayor intensidad se relaciona con peores niveles de fragilidad. Una intervencion de ejercicio fisico multicomponente puede ser beneficiosa para mejorar la calidad de vida de personas pre-fragiles con dolor cronico asi como su funcion fisica y las personas que la reciben muestran una elevada satisfaccion con ella.",

To date, there is no consensus on the treatment for RGS.A 58-year-old woman presented with persistent and unwanted genital arousal in her clitoris and labia minora. The arousal symptoms were accompanied by restless legs. Despite the pre-orgasmic feelings, orgasm was not achieved. Sexual activity did not resolve the symptoms. Two months prior to the onset of RGS symptoms a presacral abscess had been drained.Lidocaine, oxazepam, clonazepam, tramadol and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, combined with psychotherapeutic counseling, have been described as the most appropriate treatment modalities for RGS based on the experiences to date.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

      "title": "Accident-Related Stress in the Elderly: A Review of Current Trends and Implications for Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Introduction Accidents, whether minor or severe, can have significant psychological impacts, especially in elderly populations. Stress related to accidents often exacerbates pre-existing conditions or leads to new mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The psychological impact of accidents on elderly individuals is often compounded by physical frailty, social isolation, and diminished coping mechanisms. Following an accident, elderly individuals may face prolonged recovery periods, limited mobility, and a reduced sense of independence, all of which can heighten stress levels. Additionally, the fear of future accidents may lead to avoidance behaviors, further isolating them from social interactions and routine activities, thus exacerbating anxiety and depression. Pre-existing mental health conditions, such as mild cognitive impairment or chronic illness, can worsen under accident-related stress. Objectives This study aims to explore recent trends in understanding and addressing accident-related stress in elderly individuals, focusing on the psychological, social, and physiological factors contributing to their vulnerability. The primary objective of this study is to examine the psychological, social, and physiological factors that increase the vulnerability of elderly individuals to accident-related stress. Methods A mixed-methods approach was used, combining a systematic review of literature from 2015 to 2024 and interviews with mental health professionals. The sample consisted of 30 peer-reviewed studies and 25 elderly individuals aged 65 and above who had experienced accidents within the last year. Studies were selected based on relevance to accident-related stress in the elderly, with an emphasis on post-accident psychological outcomes and interventions. Results Results indicated that the elderly are more susceptible to prolonged stress responses following accidents due to physical fragility, social isolation, and reduced coping mechanisms. The review also highlighted an underutilization of mental health services in this demographic, despite the availability of stress-reduction programs. Furthermore, findings showed that older adults who participated in targeted mental health interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and peer support groups, experienced better outcomes in managing stress compared to those who did not. Conclusions In conclusion, accident-related stress in the elderly presents unique challenges that require specialized attention. Healthcare providers should prioritize early identification and tailored interventions to mitigate the long-term psychological effects of accidents in this vulnerable population.

Among the most frequent reasons of insomnia one can mention the overuse of coffee, alcohol, smoking, using some drugs, stress, depression, neurosis, dementia, chronic diseases. Idiopathic insomnia constitutes less than 5% of cases. Before the treatment of insomnia is started, its cause should be found and it should be determined if it is transient or chronic. The treatment of insomnia can be based on pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy methods. Behavioural therapy is mentioned among non-pharmacotherapeutic methods. It aims at changing the sleep-related habits. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment (still mostly based on benzodiazepines) should not last longer than 2-3 weeks and drugs of short elimination T 1/2 (below 6 hours) should be used. Side-effects of this group of drugs should always be taken into consideration. It should be remembered that sleep disturbances can be symptoms of other diseases and their treatment cannot consist in prescribing hypnotics only.",

A good knowledge of symptomatology separates a high-risk sex offender from an extremely low-risk OCD sufferer, or someone with delusions of guilt. Everyone experiences intrusive thoughts, e.g. urges to jump in front of trains; images of sexually inappropriate behaviour. People with OCD try to block these thoughts, making them worse because their brain has to think about the thing to remember to block it out, and tend to believe the experience is evidence that they are bad (or risky, abnormal, perverse). Emergency admission is rarely needed, unless patient's at high risk of self-harm. Involving HTT if the risk is moderate, otherwise, refer for follow-up by the general practitioner (GP), or community mental health teams (CMHTs) if more complex.",

      "title": "[The role of psychosocial stress in childhood for structural and functional brain development:neurobiological basis of developmental psychopathology].",
      "abstract": "This review summarizes some important principles of human brain development. Special emphasis is placed on the role of psychosocial stress during childhood on the developing brain. Depending on the degree of cognitive, behavioral and socio-emotional maturation, previous experiences and actual context, psychosocial stressors may be perceived by children as being either controllable (challenge) or uncontrollable (disaster). Controllable stress experiences are associated with a preferential activation of the central and peripheral noradrenergic system, i.e., of a system endowed with the gating of cortical information processing and the facilitation and stabilization of neuronal pathways and synaptic connections involved in behavioral responding. Uncontrollable stress responses are elicited if all previously acquired behavioral or cognitive strategies are inadequate or fail to overcome the stressor. The resulting severe and long-lasting activation of the central stress responsive systems will finally lead to a full activation of the HPA system, accompanied by adrenocortical cortisol release. The major central effect of this response is the destabilization of previously established neuronal circuits and synaptic connections. Thus, severe uncontrollable psychosocial stress may act as an important trigger of and a prerequisite for the reorganization of neuronal connectivity. It may, above a certain threshold, threaten the mental and affective stability, integrity, and the future development of a child. The long-term consequences of psychosocial stress on the structural and functional maturation of the brain are documented by findings from animal research and by results in the field of developmental psychopathology in children. The role of risk and protective factors during different phases of child development is briefly summarized and the need for a biopsychosocial model concerning the relationship between human brain development and behavior is emphasized.",

Trauma on a woman's thoughts, feelings, dreams, fantasies, intentions, and relations changing her attitude to life as such, to her nearest, also to the values and eventually to herself. The consequences occurring as uncontrolled chain reaction affect her family life, career and communication; they break her as personality and lead towards destruction. There is always a risk of suicide. In psychiatry, termination of pregnancy is very important as it can be a reason of developing psychopathology. The identified psychopathological symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder which are considered a post-abortion syndrome. Psychopathology is distinguished by its personal, spiritually painful and stigmatized character. In the course of more than thirty years of clinical practice I have met, and medical documentation describes, about five hundred cases of post-abortion syndrome in Lithuania. The problem of termination of pregnancy exposes the tragic situation of family relations and discloses the destructive effects of the lack of love and warmth between nearest and dearest people, the poverty of sexual life, a woman's slavish behavior and dependence on a man.The topic has been highly syigmatized in Lithuania. Case presentation has been discussed.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

Cases may go underdiagnosed, misdirected, or commonly treated inappropriately. Clinical studies have conclusively shown an obvious link between childhood trauma and the emergence of symptoms. Transient dissociative episodes are common and normative phenomena during childhood. We reported a case of an 8-year-old boy, who presented with a 5-day history of hallucinatory behavior. He was causing significant nuisances, sudden onset of shouting aggressively, and behavioral changes, associated with neuropsychiatric presentation such as repetitive irregular movement involving his head, neck, and upper limb. There was an asynchrony of symptoms exhibited which were unexplained by clinical semiology or patterns. He was screaming in fear, talking irrelevantly, and acting suspiciously. This was his first presentation to the hospital and no features to suggest organicity. There was no family history of mental illness. No substances, or alcohol and drug usage Serial investigation turned out to be normal and unremarkable. The episodes get frequent whenever parents or hospital staff give more attention toward him. He was given a low dose of antipsychotics, but no obvious rapid changes were observed afterward. Further exploration noted, his parents reported that the patient had been very worked up with past related trauma at school and constantly talking about it. He was afraid, distressed, and anxious as he felt something bad would happen to him. There were significant issues related to attachment figures in this boy, possibly the absent parenting style. He spent most of time playing online games and was preoccupied with them on a daily basis.",

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders",
      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation. This paper presents a brief review of our current understanding of each diagnosis and gives suggestions for management. Curr Open Pediatr 1999, 11375–378 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

DSM-5에서는 DSM-IV와 동일한 10가지 성격장애의 범주적 접근을 유지하고 있다. 한편DSM-5의 Section III에는 차원-범주 혼합모형(hybrid dimensional-categorical model)이 제안되었다. 이로써 임상가는 개인의 성격기능에서의 어려움과 성격의 병리적 특질패턴에 근거하여 성격장애의 진단과 성격을 평가할 수 있다.",

Although constitutional delay of growth and puberty is commonly seen and is often regarded as benign, there are many other causes of pubertal delay that ultimately result in permanent hypogonadism, and these must be differentiated from self-limited delays in maturation. Causes of hypogonadism include disorders affecting the gonads (primary hypogonadism) and abnormalities of pituitary or hypothalamic function (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may be part of a more global set of pituitary deficiencies or may be the only endocrine axis affected. A rapidly growing array of genetic disorders accounts for isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Treatment of delayed puberty often consists of short-term administration of sex steroids to those with constitutional delay, while individuals with permanent hypogonadism require long-term testosterone or oestradiol replacement.",

      "title": "Child abuse and neglect: psychiatric and neuro-biological consequences",
      "abstract": "Child abuse and neglect is a common problem that is potentially damaging to long-term physical and psychological health of children. Over the past, researchers have documented this relationship and have identified two possible mechanisms that can explain the increased incidence of childhood stress and consequent adult somatic disease: the increased incidence of health harming behaviors and causes epigenetic and other changes that predispose individuals to disease through a raised non-specific inflammatory profile [1]. Abuse survivors, as well as persons who have experienced other types of childhood adversities, are more likely to participate in high-risk behaviors [2]. Possible etiologic factors in survivors' health problems include abuse-related alterations in brain functioning that can increase vulnerability to stress and decrease immune function. Adult survivors are also more likely to participate in risky behaviors that undermine health or to have cognitions and beliefs that amplify health problems [2].\r\n\r\nChildhood abuse and early life stress may become hard-coded into the genome, creating an epigenetic memory of events that leads to impaired health at a later date [3].\r\n\r\nChronic early life stress results in long-term changes in HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis function and regulation typified by hypersecretion of CRH and ACTH. The initial hypersecretion of cortisol may over time lead to blunting of the cortisol response to CRH and ACTH and relative glucocorticoid resistance. A decrease in glucocorticoid levels or impaired glucocorticoid receptor function might then lead to increased stress responsiveness [2].\r\n\r\nChildhood abuse and neglect is also associated with reduced adult hippocampal volume, particularly on the left side, and these findings support the hypothesis that exposure to early stress in humans, as in other animals, affects hippocampal subfield development [4].\r\n\r\nAnother recent study demonstrate that children who experienced two or more types of violence exposure showed significantly accelerated telomere erosion from age-5 baseline to age-10 follow-up measurement compared with children who had one type of violence exposure or who were not exposed to violence [5].\r\n\r\nPeople experience and interpret physical and emotional insults in diverse ways and many contextual factors affect the phenomenology of abuse and neglect, and in Italy there are many children victims of various types of maltreatment particularly within their own families. But we must not forget the most vulnerable children who may have even more serious consequences: those who live in foster care [6] or abandoned babies [7] that are actually little-known but that equally needs of social interventions, health and human rights.",

Problems with sexual desire and arousal may indicate a diagnosis of HSDD or may occur secondary to factors such as poorly controlled depressive symptoms, the manifestations of menopause, or the side effects of antidepressant medications. Moreover, declining estrogen levels beginning during perimenopause may decrease vaginal lubrication and cause atrophy of vaginal tissue, which can result in discomfort during intercourse and can also reduce desire. Because of the complex interplay among many factors, it is not always possible to clearly identify the primary disorder in a patient such as the one in this case. An important consideration is that personal distress must be present to establish a diagnosis of HSDD.",

      "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common, disregarded, underdiagnosed, and inadequately treated complaint of both young and adult females. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which start shortly before or at the onset of menses and which could last for 3 days. In particular, PD negatively impacts the quality of life (QOL) of young females and is the main reason behind their absenteeism from school or work. It is suggested that increased intrauterine secretion of prostaglandins F2α and E2 are responsible for the pelvic pain associated with this disorder. Its associated symptoms are physical and/or psychological. Its physical symptoms include headache, lethargy, sleep disturbances, tender breasts, various body pains, disturbed appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and increased urination, whereas its psychological symptoms include mood disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, and irritability. While its diagnosis is based on patients' history, symptoms, and physical examination, its treatment aims to improve the QOL through the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and/or the use of non-pharmacological aids (e.g., topical heat application and exercise). Patients must be monitored to measure their response to treatment, assess their adherence, observe potential side effects, and perform further investigations, if needed.",

      "abstract": "Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "title": "Presurgical Psychological Screening in Chronic Pain Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Pain is an unfortunate daily experience for many individuals. Chronic pain -- lasting six or more months -- is suffered by approximately 30% of the population in the United States. These individuals wake up, function during the day and go to sleep, trying to keep pain at a minimum while, at the same time, maintaining some quality of life. They may make frequent visits to the doctor and the pharmacy. When they find relief, it is usually short-lived and comes at a cost such as dependence on narcotic medications or complete limitation of activity. Pain often becomes the central point of their existence. This practice guide describes an approach to psychological evaluation of the chronic pain patient who is being considered for surgery. A large body of research is accumulating which demonstrates that the outcome of surgical procedures aimed at chronic pain relief can be strongly influenced by psychological and emotional factors. This approach, termed \"presurgical psychological screening\" (PPS) uses interview and testing techniques to identify emotional, behavioral, and psychosocial difficulties which have been demonstrated to negatively impact surgical outcome. Studies show that even patients with clearly identifiable pathophysiology may respond poorly to surgery, due to issues such as pain sensitivity, medication dependence, rewards for pain behavior and personality style. Thus, some insurance carriers, rehabilitation nurses and state worker's compensation systems are encouraging, or even requiring, presurgical psychological screening in cases of surgery designed to relieve chronic pain. The first to present a comprehensive, unified approach to PPS in chronic pain syndromes, this text is designed to provide the behavioral health practitioner, as well as the trainee, with all the tools and information necessary to conduct PPS evaluations. It identifies a multitude of risk factors for poor surgical outcome and reviews research associated with each risk factor. Hands-on techniques for eliciting information from the patient about risk factors is also detailed. Toward this end, the practice guide also contains a number of forms and session outlines which can be directly utilized, or which can be altered to fit readers' needs. Models for weighing and combining surgical outcome risk factors are also provided. Thus, practitioners are able to reach valid and reliable predictions of surgical results. Finally, the text provides outlines of psychological interventions which can facilitate surgical outcome as well as surgical treatment alternatives. Upon completion of this practice guide, readers should be able to begin providing PPS evaluations which are scientifically valid, clinically sound, and which result in significant overall improvement in the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.",

HH may result from either absent or inadequate hypothalamic GnRH secretion or failure of pituitary gonadotropin secretion. Several congenital and acquired causes, including functional and organic forms, have been associated with this condition. One important aspect of the HH diagnosis is that it may reflect the presence of a tumor of the hypothalamic pituitary region or even a systemic disease. On the other hand, functional forms of HH, characterized by a transient defect in GnRH secretion, are relatively common in women, in response to significant weight loss, exercise, or stress leading to hypothalamic amenorrhea. HH is typically characterized by low circulating sexual steroids associated with low or inappropriately normal gonadotropin levels. The precise and early diagnosis of HH can prevent negative physical and psychological sequelae, preserve normal peak bone mass, and restore the fertility in affected patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms subjective and objective often appear in health care records, and one commonly hears about “subjective symptoms” and “objective complaints”—yet the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron. Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

This at least is the feeling of many professionals in the field of child development in Britain, who believe that in recent years they have been seeing more children with autistic spectrum disorders.

He called this “early infantile autism.” His essential criteria for diagnosis were social aloofness and elaborate repetitive routines.2 Subsequent epidemiological studies have shown that autism is not, as Kanner first thought, a unique and separate condition occurring in children of otherwise normal development but that it is closely related to a range of developmental disorders.3 4 These include Asperger's syndrome,5 a condition characterised by borderline or normal IQ; social isolation or naive, inappropriate social interaction; intensive interest in only one or two subjects; a narrow, repetitive life style; limited or inappropriate intonation and body language; and poor motor coordination.\n\nAutistic spectrum disorders share a triad of impaired social interaction, communication, and imagination, associated with a rigid, repetitive pattern of behaviour.

This may result in premature diagnosis, and in a poor response to psychiatric treatment.

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness.

The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony.

A useful clinical indicator that the event was the trigger is that the intensity of the symptoms increases when it is being recalled or recounted and diminishes when the person is removed from it. A number of differentials should also be considered. ICD-11 proposes specific criteria for ICD-11 that include preoccupation with the stressor and difficulty adapting, as evidenced by impaired concentration, sleep disturbance, and so on, causing impairment in functioning.

Inadequate sleep, either in duration or quality, and altered sleep-wake cycles are common reports in palliative care. The causes for insomnia in palliative care may be related to psychological factors (anxiety or depression), pain, treatment-related toxicity, or other comorbid medical conditions. Untreated insomnia can lead to daytime sleepiness, irritability, depressive or anxious mood, and accidents. Assessment, prevention, and management are addressed. The chapter includes discussion regarding sleep hygiene, the role of exercise, and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Education of patients and their family members is imperative to address this syndrome.",

For the physician, it is a guide to diagnosis itself, and for the patient it is a signal which warns of new conditions of the body and soul or of a disorder. Objectives Mental disorders are most commonly presented by a group of symptoms, among which the patients often can’t point out the leading one. Anxiety as a symptom can occur in a number of psychiatric entities and it can stimulate differential diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. We will show a 26-year female in which the internal anxiety is the main symptom. Aim To underlined the importance of taking in to account a leading symptom of the disease in the way of establishing the correct diagnosis. Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis. Following the choosing of an effective psycho-pharmacological combination, and with the goal of reducing a leading symptom, according to enlarged diagnostic process, we decided to diagnose the Schizoaffective disorders (F 25.2).",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

There is little quantitative change in pain associated psychopathology and coping mechanisms in the elderly as compared to younger patients. However, qualitative changes are identified. The high degree of association between chronic pain and depression remains throughout the age span. However, age variations in the expression of psychological distress are to be noted. Elderly patients have a tendency to make a greater use of somatic complaints and avoid the expression of the emotional dimension of distress. This clinical particularity is discussed. Special attention should be paid to the multidimensional aspects of pain complaints in the elderly in order not to underestimate its affective components.",

Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

      "abstract": "It is reported that erectile dysfunction affects 100 million men worldwide and is common among older age groups. Erectile dsfunction and coronary hear t disease (CHD) share the same risk factors. They may develop independently but often develop together. The ability to have an erection is integral to a man's perception of his wel -being. Evidence suggests that only a small proportion of people will ask for help. This highlights the importance of feeling comfortable enough to raise and discuss sexual matters. Erectile dysfunction in patients with CHD may have psychological origins owing to a fear of serious cardiac incident, but may also have physiological causes owing to a disease process/arterial damage, or it may be a combination of both. In most cases there will be a variety of treatment options which are available.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is one of the most common sexual dysfunctions in men, with prevalence rates ranging from 21% to 31%. Because many physicians do not inquire about sexual dysfunction and patients are reluctant to offer it as a medical complaint, PE is underreported in clinical practice. A sexual history is therefore necessary to uncover the diagnosis. PE can have a significant impact on the quality of life of the patient and his sexual partner, and may lead to psychological distress and loss of self-esteem. It appears that PE has no single etiology, and treatments have been based on both its neurophysiologic and behavioral components. Although no therapies are currently approved for PE by the US Food and Drug Administration, medications that have shown some success include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and topical anesthetics. Behavioral techniques have been the mainstay of PE treatment, and include techniques to decrease sensory input.",

      "abstract": "Objetivo: A depressão pode ser uma complicação psiquiátrica do acidente vascular encefálico (AVE), contudo tal relação precisa ser mais bem elucidada. Assim, objetivou-se revisar a relação entre AVE e o desenvolvimento de depressão maior. Metodologia: Foram utilizadas as bases de dados PubMed, Cochrane e EMBASE, com os descritores “depression” ou “mood” e “stroke” ou “cerebrovascular”, sendo selecionados 37 artigos. Foram excluídas publicações anteriores ao ano de 2000. Resultados e Discussão: A depressão é a alteração psiquiátrica mais associada ao AVE, sendo mais incidente de 3-6 meses pós-AVE: a cada 3 pacientes que sofrem AVE, 1 desenvolve depressão. O quadro está relacionado a características sociais e clínicas individuais (sexo, apoio familiar recebido, déficit de função e grau de dependência, extensão e localização do dano e presença de outras alterações vasculares), sendo a incapacidade física desencadeada pelo evento agudo o fator de risco mais relevante para o desenvolvimento do quadro. Mesmo diante disso, os resultados dos estudos sobre a depressão pós-AVE são discordantes, posto que existe a dificuldade em estabelecer e padronizar diagnóstico. Ainda que exista essa barreira, estudos sugerem que o desenvolvimento de depressão está relacionado à área específica do cérebro acometida no AVE. A associação mais evidente está relacionada aos eventos que atingem o circuito pré-frontosubcortical, sobretudo do hemisfério esquerdo. Em contrapartida, outros estudos afirmam que o desenvolvimento de depressão pós-AVE se relaciona com a extensão do dano e não com a área neuronal acometida. Conclusão: Embora a relação entre AVE e o desenvolvimento de depressão precise ser elucidada é inegável que existe uma relação entre ambas. É necessário mais conhecimento para firmar os fatores de risco e os desfechos associados e, por conseguinte, entender a etiologia e as implicações desta condição na recuperação neurológica dos pacientes.",

Although sub-clinical sleep disturbances (insufficient sleep duration or inadequate sleep quality) may be difficult to assess with conceptual and/or methodological clarity, this review attempts to summarize and synthesize these findings. First, the concept of sleep disturbance in a public health context is introduced, to provide context and rationale. Second, operational definitions of 'cardiometabolic disease' and 'sleep disturbance' are offered, to address many unclear operationalizations. Third, the extant literature is summarized regarding short or long sleep duration and/or insufficient sleep, insomnia and insomnia symptoms, general (non-specific sleep disturbances), circadian rhythm abnormalities that result in sleep disturbances, and, briefly, sleep-disordered breathing. Fourth, the review highlights the social/behavioural context of sleep, including discussions of sleep and race/ethnicity, socio-economic position, and other social/environmental factors, in order to place these findings in a social-environmental context relevant to public health. Fifth, the review highlights the issue of sleep as a domain of health behaviour and addresses issues regarding development of healthy sleep interventions. Finally, a research agenda of future directions is proposed.",

Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

      "abstract": "A thorough knowledge of the patient's earlier life is required for an assessment of the background of Menière's disease. Psychosomatic factors should be given special attention during interviews. For a correct picture to be obtained, the help of a specially trained worker i.e. a psychiatrist or psychologist, should be enlisted. Factors and casual relationships can then be uncovered which remain problems to doctors not thus specialized. The two series dealt with in this study illustrate this clearly. Summarizing the observations made, Menière patients subjected to careful psychic and somatic analysis are found to have a predisposing psychosomatic constitution which, under chronic or acute stress, leads to such somatic manifestations as, in their turn, seem to presuppose a certain somatic predisposition—in this particular case evidently in the ear. Chronic stress seems to impair prognosis, a fact not difficult to understand considering that the mode of reaction depends upon the constitution, which—obviously—is of fairly permanent nature.",

      "title": "Sexual side effects of drugs.",
      "abstract": "The number of persons with drug induced sexual dysfunction has risen simultaneously with the unending increase in the number of commercially available drugs. Sexual dysfunction may seriously impair the human psyche. Patients do not often admit to sexual dysfunction, however, so physicians often miss the symptoms entirely. In addition, they may attribute them to other causes, such as depression. Drugs disrupt all 3 neurophysiologic phases of sexual response (desire, excitement, and orgasm), especially in men, either causing a decrease or loss of libido, impotence (the most common symptom), or failure of ejaculation or anorgasmia. The mechanisms involved are not well understood. Researchers do know, however, that the drug cimetidine (Tagamet) blocks androgen receptors, decreases testosterone synthesis, and induces higher circulating levels of estradiol resulting in impotence and breast enlargement in men. Antihypertensive drugs have a higher frequency of causing sexual dysfunction, particularly impotence, than other drugs. Some also induce or worsen depression that can in turn cause or intensify sexual dysfunction. Both legal and illegal psychoactive drugs act on multiple sites thus often stimulating sexual dysfunction. Further, some hormonal drugs also induce sexual side effects, such as norethindrone and progesterone. Physicians who prescribe a drug associated with sexual side effects should inform patients about their possible occurrence and recommend that they be aware of the symptoms. They should ask these patients do not usually offer this information themselves. If sexual dysfunction develops, physicians can reduce the dosage or switch to an alternative drug. At that time, they should express optimism that the sexual dysfunction will cease.",

Behavioral therapy and surgery have an important role in treating this symptom. By careful pre-treatment evaluation the most appropriate therapy can be selected. It has been our general rule that when neither clear organic nor psychogenic problems lie at the root of the difficulty, a trial of behavioral therapy is the most appropriate procedure.

      "title": "Effects of SSRIs on Sexual Function",
      "abstract": "Sexual problems are highly prevalent in both men and women and are affected by, among other factors, mood state, interpersonal functioning, and psychotropic medications.The incidence of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction is difficult to estimate because of the potentially confounding effects of the illness itself, social and interpersonal comorbidities, medication effects, and design and assessment problems in most studies. Estimates of sexual dysfunction vary from a small percentage to more than 80%. This article reviews current evidence regarding sexual side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Among the sexual side effects most commonly associated with SSRIs are delayed ejaculation and absent or delayed orgasm. Sexual desire (libido) and arousal difficulties are also frequently reported, although the specific association of these disorders to SSRI use has not been consistently shown. The effects of SSRIs on sexual functioning seem strongly dose-related and may vary among the group according to serotonin and dopamine reuptake mechanisms, induction of prolactin release, anticholinergic effects, inhibition of nitric oxide synthetase, and propensity for accumulation over time. A variety of strategies have been reported in the management of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, including waiting for tolerance to develop, dosage reduction, drug holidays, substitution of another antidepressant drug, and various augmentation strategies with 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2), 5-HT3, and [small alpha, Greek]2 adrenergic receptor antagonists, 5-HT1A and dopamine receptor agonists, and phosphodiesterase (PDE5) enzyme inhibitors. Sexual side effects of SSRIs should not be viewed as entirely negative; some studies have shown improved control of premature ejaculation in men. The impacts of sexual side effects of SSRIs on treatment compliance and on patients' quality of life are important clinical considerations. (J Clin Psychopharmacol 1999;19:67-85)",

      "abstract": "Otello syndrome derives its name from Shakespeare's drama (character) and, clinically, describes a person with delusions of the partner's infidelity. A variety of other psychopathology may present: obsessive-compulsive features, alcohol dependency, voyeurism, sadism, possessiveness and domineering, hyper-sexuality, paranoid attitude, abuse of different nature, violent behaviour, including, occasionally, homicide. Yet, in the author's opinion, the syndrome, unless it presents itself as obviously absurd, is frequently missed. Management is rather difficult and does not always result in recovery but, if not treated with neuroleptics, it would render any other means of treatment useless. The condition could pose a diagnostic challenge. Moreover, it also poses an ethical dilemma whether to warn the spouse of the psychotic condition of the partner, the poor prognosis and possible implications of its existence. Moreover, the long-term partners of such patients frequently present with the symptoms of dependency, submissiveness or even masochism. The paper discusses the abovementioned issues, including the likely psychodynamics, biological background, historical and social elements and possible effective management.

      "title": "Factors impacting bladder underactivity and clinical implications.",
      "abstract": "Lower urinary tract symptoms in the voiding phase can be due to an underactive bladder, but are usually similar to symptoms of infravesical obstruction or dysfunctional voiding. The underactive bladder can be caused by an impaired detrusor contraction but also by a derangement of local and central neuro-cognitive regulatory systems or an impairment of bladder sensation. Potential risk factors of bladder underactivity include: ageing, diabetes, neurogenic disease, cardiovascular disease, obstruction and psychological causes. Comprehensive diagnostic and detection techniques for an underactive detrusor are necessary. To establish the diagnosis and follow up new treatments, useful urodynamic parameters and threshold values have to be determined. As neuro-cognitive regulation plays an important role in the control of voiding, psychological factors have to be taken into account during the assessment in these patients. Ambulatory urodynamic techniques therefore have to be considered. Voiding is determined by the balance of both the detrusor contraction and the resistance of the bladder outlet, a dysfunction in one factor can be compensated by a counter-acting function of the other factor. Therefore, to predict voiding problems in the future, it will be indicated to assess the compensatory capacity of the detrusor contractility, contractile reserve, and the outlet relaxation capacity. If novel treatments and evaluation techniques have become available, it is likely that in the future, many patients that get a TURP now, can be treated by pharmacological agents directed towards increasing the bladder contractility in a balanced combination with medication directed towards lowering the bladder outlet resistance.",

Bulbar paralysis and respiratory involvement adversely affected the outcome. Electrodiagnostic evidence of fibrillation, polyphasic action potentials and markedly reduced amplitude of motor action potentials were indicative of poor prognosis. However, age and sex of the patients, severity of sensory loss, sphincteric disturbances, CSF findings and nerve conduction velocities did not significantly affect the outcome.

Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients.

      "abstract": "Depression is associated with considerable disability, morbidity, and mortality. In many patients, depression follows a course of relapse and/or recurrence. However, there is significant evidence that the majority of patients with depressive disorders are undertreated and this imposes a substantial economic burden on society. The reasons for undertreatment include patient, provider, and healthcare system factors. It is vital that treatment be targeted appropriately to break the cycle of relapse/recurrence. Rather than short-term improvement of symptoms, the optimal outcome of treatment of depressive disorders should be full symptom resolution (remission) and long-term recovery. Patients with histories of recurrent depressive episodes may require long-term, indefinite treatment with antidepressants. Currently, few data exist on the outcome and appropriate duration of maintenance pharmacotherapy. The benefits of psychotherapy have recently been demonstrated in a 12-week, randomized, controlled study, which also includes a maintenance phase that has not yet been completed. Additional well-designed studies addressing these issues are urgently needed.",

      "abstract": "Tradicionalmente se han venido distinguiendo dos grandes tipologias de criminalidad relacionadas con las drogas, la delincuencia funcional y la delincuencia inducida. En ambos casos de criminalidad la causa de la delincuencia es el consumo de drogas. El Codigo penal de 1995 presta especial atencion al problema del consumo y la dependencia de las drogas aportando una regulacion especifica sobre la incidencia que sobre la capacidad de culpabilidad tiene el consumo y la dependencia de las drogas. La eximente de intoxicacion requiere tres elementos: Un presupuesto biologico o psiquiatrico, un estado de intoxicacion en el momento de cometer el delito un componente psicologico, imposibilidad de comprender el caracter ilicito de su conducta o de actuar conforme a ese conocimiento y un requisito\nnegativo, que la intoxicacion no haya sido provocada con el proposito de cometer el delito o que el sujeto haya previsto o debido prever que en estado de intoxicacion podria cometer un delito. El sindrome de abstinencia es una alteracion psiquica que se caracteriza por un sindrome especifico, que viene determinado por la clase de sustancia, debido al cese o reduccion del consumo prolongado de esa sustancia. El estado carencial crea una presion motivacional que explica la falta de libertad en el proceso de determinacion de la voluntad para actuar conforme a la norma. La adiccion a sustancias psicoactivas se define como un estado psiquico y fisico determinado por el consumo continuado de droga durante un periodo de tiempo, que se caracteriza por la perdida del control en el uso de la susta\nncia. La introduccion de la atenuante de grave adiccion supone reconocer que el consumo de drogas reiterado puede ocasionar una adiccion a las sustancias, que influye en la capacidad volitiva del sujeto limitando de forma relevante su\ncapacidad de actuar conforme a la norma dado la compulsion al consumo de esa sustancia. Desde esta concepcion de la grave adiccion lo coherente hubiera sido reconocer a la grave adiccion como un supuesto de semi-imputabilidad y no como una mera atenuante de la culpabilidad. Lo que permitiria, sin necesidad de acudir a la analogia in bonam partem, aplicar al adicto la medida de seguridad de tratamiento de deshabituacion.",

      "abstract": "The age at which individuals are most physically aggressive is 22 months. However, some children fail to inhibit this normal aggression and by the time they are three or four are showing signs of oppositional defiant disorder. In older children persistent antisocial behaviour is classified as conduct disorder. At any age, antisocial behaviour is on a continuum, and while the most severe 5% or so will meet diagnostic criteria, those falling short are often described as having conduct problems. Epidemiological follow-up surveys show that the risk of poor outcomes in antisocial children is very high. The causes are multiple but two sets of factors stand out. First, genetic predisposition. Even children adopted away from violent or criminal parents have three or four times the rate of antisocial behaviour and second, poor parenting. Watching and waiting is a reasonable strategy if the antisocial behaviour is not very severe. It is important to be vigilant for severe tantrums or aggression occurring almost every day, harsh, rough, or inconsistent parenting and coexistent ADHD. If severity is moderate, referral to an evidence-based parenting group would be a good first move. If this fails to make things better, or if the child or parent has a comorbid condition, referral to CAMHS is indicated. For older children, aged 10 to 17, there are effective interventions such as anger management CBT and parenting groups for adolescents.",

      "title": "The <scp>ICD</scp>‐11 opens the door for overdue improved identification of depression in men",
      "abstract": "Population prevalence rates indicate that depression is twice as common in women as in men1. But, is this estimate an accurate reflection of men's mental health, or rather an artifact of diagnostic criteria favouring female-typical manifestations of depression2? We and others would argue that the latter is, in fact, the case2-6. Indeed, results from decades of epidemiological and clinical studies point to the existence of a depressive syndrome with marked externalizing features (e.g., irritability, aggression, risk-taking and alcohol/substance misuse) which is particularly prevalent among males (especially younger ones) and likely related to an increased risk for suicide2-6. Yet, detecting and treating male depression is seriously complicated by the fact that the two major diagnostic manuals currently used in psychiatry, the DSM-5 and the ICD-10, do not consider these externalizing symptoms. Most importantly, the key role of irritability in male depression4-6 is not reflected in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for major depression. According to these criteria, irritability can superseed depressed mood only in children and adolescents, but not in adults, which seems to be an arbitrary distinction. In the recently introduced ICD-117, which is set to replace the ICD-10 over the course of the following years, both irritability and an absence of emotional experience (\"emptiness\") can replace depressed mood as the so-called affective component requirement for a depressive episode, irrespective of age7. This represents a substantial improvement with regard to the identification of depressive disorders in men who present with an externalizing phenotype4. Indeed, irritability is among the core symptoms included in male-specific inventories of depression5, 6, and likely underlies and relates to other symptoms that characterize male depression, such as aggression, alcohol/substance misuse and risk-taking, all of which are also assessed in those inventories. Notably, according to one of these inventories, the Gotland Male Depression Rating Scale5, feelings of emptiness are also a feature of male depression. Hence, by allowing for both irritability and absence of emotional experience (emptiness) to replace depressed mood in the symptom requirements for a depressive episode, a group of predominantly male individuals who did previously not meet criteria for depression will likely fulfill them with the introduction of the ICD-118. While those with special interest in this topic will find the described change in the ICD-11 to be both substantial and important, this change may go unnoticed by most practitioners seeing the men who will benefit from being identified and treated. Therefore, information and training initiatives to raise awareness about this change and its implications for clinical practice will be required. Relatedly, health care systems will have to prepare for the increased demand for (specific) care caused by this diagnostic change. Furthermore, the externalizing depression phenotype contributes to the help-seeking barrier experienced by men. To overcome this, screening initiatives may be needed within environments with predominant male representation and typical masculine values, such as military services, manual labor organizations, and sports clubs. There is a known relationship between the male depression phenotype and suicidality3, 4, 8. Assuming that the men affected can be treated successfully, these initiatives are likely to reduce the number of suicides among men. With approximately 700,000 suicides globally every year, the majority among men, even relatively minor improvements to detection rates could potentially save thousands of lives and improve the quality of even more lives. The described changes to the ICD-11 will hopefully inspire the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to make analogue changes in the next edition of the DSM. Recently, the DSM-5-TR noted that \"men with depression may be more likely than depressed women to report greater frequencies and intensities of maladaptive self-coping and problem-solving strategies, including alcohol or other drug misuse, risk taking, and poor impulse control\"9. Thus, as the ICD-11 incorporates diagnostic changes in line with the evolving evidence base, it also seems that the door remains open for an (overdue) update of forthcoming DSM criteria for major depression. Although supportive of the above changes, we are aware that they will not occur without associated challenges. Both the number of, and the symptom heterogeneity among, individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for depression will increase. This will, in turn, increase the need for treatment stratification by depressive subtypes. Relatedly, for individuals meeting depression criteria according to the ICD-11, but not according to the ICD-10 (or the DSM-IV and DSM-5), it can be argued that currently approved treatments may not be (equally) effective, as these individuals have not been adequately represented in the studies in which these treatments were tested. Therefore, changes to the diagnostic requirements for depression must spur research initiatives focusing on this specific group, including validation of the efficacy of available treatments. In conclusion, we argue that the changes in the conceptualization of depression in the ICD-11 will open the door for an overdue improved identification of depression in men. If implemented wisely and integrated with appropriate information and screening initiatives, this may lead to reductions in the number of suicides and improved mental health among men. Hopefully, the benefits of this change to the diagnostic criteria for depression will be sufficiently evident to the APA for it to make analogue changes in the DSM system when due.",

      "abstract": "Psychological changes or rather the recovery from psycho-somatic diseases at old age can point out a chronic failure of solutions. This means that in the course of their individual life people have not found satisfying solutions for conflicts and identity endangering stress. The result of such a process often means an advancement of diseases in old age. This is the reason why it is very important-especially for aged and/or care-needing people-that concepts are developed in the field of geriatric nursing that provide solutions for life that has been \"misunderstood\". But the old-peoples-care, which is oriented one-sidedly on physical deficiency, prevents the process of reconciling with lived and not lived life. The consequence is that certain forms of diseases in correspondence with changes in behavior leading to aggression, apathy, depression etc. are supposedly (medically) \"cured\" or \"stagnated\" by the use of neuroleptica. The possibility of a self-responsible, positive life-mastering is suppressed. The questions for the causes of psychological changes at old age remain unasked, and they are simply called \"mental and physical stagnation caused by old-age\". In practice, this means that the geriatric system rather supports illness than health and self-determination at old age.",

There has been a wealth of interest in the endocrinology of this condition, which will be reviewed in this article. Most studied has been the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; although the quality of many studies is poor, the overall balance of evidence points to reduced cortisol output in at least some patients, with some evidence that this is linked to symptom production or persistence. There is evidence for heightened negative feedback and glucocorticoid receptor function and for impaired ACTH and cortisol responses to a variety of challenges. However, there is no evidence for a specific or uniform dysfunction of the HPA axis. Given the many factors that may impinge on the HPA axis in CFS, such as inactivity, sleep disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, medication, and ongoing stress, it seems likely that HPA axis dist...",

      "abstract": "Abstract Upper extremity impairment rarely is assessed using grip strength, according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), because results can be influenced by subjective factors that are difficult to control, including sex, age, comorbidities, fatigue, handedness, time of day, pain, and the individual's cooperation. The AMA Guides, Section 16.5b, Impairment Evaluation Methods, discusses the approach used for rating peripheral nerve injuries, but this section applies only to specific nerve lesions with resulting weakness of the muscles supplied or sensory changes. Strength correlates only poorly with performance of the activities of daily living, and grip strength testing using a dynamometer or other types of isometric strength testing has not been shown to reliably discriminate between submaximal and maximal efforts. Grip strength usually is not used in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of body parts (eg, missing digit), nor is it used to rate weakness from a peripheral nerve lesion. In rare cases, the AMA Guides allows the use of loss of strength (eg, due to a severe muscle tear that healed leaving a palpable muscle defect). Impairment ratings based on objective anatomic findings take precedence, and loss of strength is rarely combined and only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes.",

      "abstract": "Throughout the ages, numerous superstitions, restrictions, and fears have been imposed on the normal function of the reproductive organs, and they are still found in modified forms in our present social culture. To the emotional unrest caused by these vestiges of ancient taboos may be added disturbances of the female reproductive organs that are caused by other emotional conflicts. In psychosomatic illness, the patient is a victim of some emotional conflict of which she is unaware. Her symptoms are real, but the causes are elusive. Because she is disturbed, she consults a physician in an effort to discover an organic basis for her symptoms. Menstrual disturbances; vague, low, abdominal pain; intramenstrual cramping; headache, nausea, vomiting; palpitation, loose stools, and urinary frequency may be associated with emotional conflicts. Marital problems may be the causative factor, or may intensify gynecological conditions. Sexual maladjustment may cause a woman to be frigid or to have dyspareunia. Menstrual disturbances may be the only manifestation of her unhappiness. Some physicians believe that emotional conflicts may play an important part in sterility. A patient who consults her physician because of symptoms for which no physical basis may be found needs as much sympathy and understanding as does the patient with demonstrable physical pathology. Her pains and aches, troubles and miseries, discontents and disappointments are very real to her; she must not simply be classed as neurotic, ignored when she lists her complaints, or rushed through her examination and consultation with the physician. The nurse's understanding will be of great comfort to this patient and perhaps will even be a factor in helping her get well.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain affects up to 26% of individuals with female anatomy and is defined as at least 6 months of pain that is perceived to originate in the pelvis. Chronic pelvic pain is highly correlated with psychosocial comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and history of abuse. Although common causes include irritable bowel syndrome, bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis), pelvic floor dysfunction, and endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain is most often the result of multiple coexisting pain conditions and central nervous system hypersensitivity. Evaluation requires a biopsychosocial approach, beginning with a complete history and physical examination to ensure an accurate and timely diagnosis. Diagnostic laboratory and imaging tests are of limited utility and should be tailored to investigate presenting symptoms and examination findings. When a single etiology is identified, treatment should follow disease-specific guidelines; otherwise, the management of undifferentiated chronic pelvic pain should follow an interdisciplinary approach to improve function and quality of life. Multimodal treatment includes pain education, self-care, behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and pharmacotherapy, with limited indications for surgical interventions. Regular follow-up to review progress is necessary. Clinicians should have a low threshold for referral to interdisciplinary pain management or other subspecialties when improvement is not seen.",

      "title": "I paint, I sing, I dance; I also have a mental illness: The importance of personally meaningful leisure activities in recovery from severe mental illness",
      "abstract": "Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) often have sedentary and secluded life. It leads to compounded psychological and physical effects in the form of feeling isolated, having an increased propensity for lifestyle-related illnesses, and the like.[1] It affects the perception of others also, which often manifests as a narrow and negative approach to the patient and their problems. This approach creates an impression that the patient and their issues are inseparable and that their life revolves around those problems. It leads to neglect and underestimation of the patient's abilities, hobbies, and likings. For example, a patient with schizophrenia may be perceived as someone with eccentricities (e.g., talks to self) who does not adequately involve in daily living activities and remains secluded. Unfortunately, a patient may imbibe these perceptions leading to self-stigma, which, in turn, can affect their overall functioning.[2] It is, therefore, imperative that intervention for mental illness has a strength-based approach that focuses on the person's abilities apart from the target to improve the symptoms. Motivating patients to engage in personally meaningful activities they enjoy can be a step in this direction. It does not only defocus the attention of the patient and the caregivers from a \"symptom only\" approach but also help make the patient active, participative, and involved in what interests them. Given this, therapeutic recreation is being advocated as one of the ways to promote health and wellness in individuals with mental illness.[3] Therapeutic recreation promotes positive behaviour, such as social connectedness and cooperation, by involving people in therapeutic residential camping, leisure activities, and the like. Involving people in such leisure and recreational activities can be an effective way of reinvigorating those self-soothing and enjoyable activities that get subdued in the inactive life of mental illness. Furthermore, patients can be involved in such goal-driven recreational activities that reduce the illness effects. For example, specially designed cognitively stimulating recreational activities can effectively reduce the cognitive impairments commonly observed in people with severe mental illness. Likewise, group activities can help enhance social skills, decrease apathy (and other negative symptoms), and improve interpersonal skills. THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE Of late, there has been a surge of interest in understanding the effectiveness of leisure activities in promoting the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness. Research indicates that involvement in personally meaningful leisure activities can boost recovery and aid toward active living for people with mental illness.[4,5] For example, enjoyable leisure activities and perceived active living consistently correlate with a sense of well-being and recovery.[5–7] Therapeutic recovery camps, aiming to involve participants in physically and mentally challenging activities, have been found to lead to a sense of determination to overcome the challenges caused by mental illness.[3] Activities that involve adventure and fun (such as rock climbing, picnic, and skating) can be physically stimulating, weight reducing (a common requirement in mental illness due to metabolic abnormalities), and a boost to self-esteem.[8] Also, leisure activities can act as a protector from mental illness. For example, a sense of meaningful use of time through leisure activities is associated with lower depressive symptoms.[9,10] NOT \"ONE FIT FOR ALL\" Since recreational and leisure activities can significantly boost the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness, these activities must be part of the overall intervention plan. While doing this, a few things need to be kept in mind. For example: The activities chosen must be personally meaningful for the individual. The contribution of leisure activities in recovery and active living largely depends on what meanings the patients gain from those activities.[4,5] Perception of an activity to be personally meaningful motivates the individual to engage and continue it. For example, realizing that doing yoga with friends brings a positive mood, helps companionship, and revitalizes spirituality can be a driving force for engaging in it regularly.[4] Iwasaki and colleagues suggest that leisure activities can be meaningful for an individual if they promote a sense of belongingness, autonomy, competence, and other factors.[5] Active living does not limit to some physical exercises; it also involves activities that augment body-mind-spirit harmony and promote emotional health, social connectedness, creativity, and so on.[11] Recreational and leisure activities should be planned in a manner that it incorporates the patient's needs. For example, a patient with cognitive deficits can be involved in such activities that are cognitively stimulating. Involving patients to work in groups to create Rangolis (an art in which an array of colors is precisely used to create designs on the floor) can be an enjoyable activity with the potential to improve attention. INDIAN SCENARIO Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research from India about the effectiveness of therapeutic recreational activities for people with SMI. It has significant implications; for example, even if some centers involve patients in recreational activities, they are not guaranteed to be effective. At NIMHANS, we have started a structured recreational program that involves patients in various leisure activities according to their choice. A preliminary study shows that the patients perceive the benefits of these activities in terms of the experience of positive emotions, opportunities for social interactions, and the like.[12] We need more research exploring the utility of various approaches to actively include patients and their caregivers in focused recreational and leisure activities, such as recreational camping for a longer duration. We must remember that symptom amelioration is not the sole target of working with people with mental illness. Recovery is a broader concept with a strength-based perspective to enable an individual to lead a meaningful life and utilize their potential to the fullest. Recreational activities can serve as an important medium to attain this goal. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

Concernant la prevalence de l’anorexie mentale en population masculine, elle apparait probablement sous-estimee. Cliniquement, les sujets masculins presenteraient moins de preoccupations corporelles et autour du poids, et seraient plus soucieux de leur musculature. L’hyperactivite physique ne serait pas plus marquee que chez les femmes. Les facteurs de risque evoques sont : un surpoids ou une obesite premorbides, un trouble anxieux et un trouble depressif. L’homosexualite serait frequente. Les comorbidites psychiatriques sont importantes, l’anxiete et la depression au premier plan, de meme que chez les femmes. Le risque suicidaire est present, et le taux de mortalite est eleve. Les recommandations de prise en charge de l’anorexie mentale semblent efficaces chez les sujets masculins. Des adaptations sont necessaires : ils doivent etre recus dans un lieu de soins accueillant, leurs plus grandes difficultes a exprimer leurs emotions doit etre prise en compte, et l’interet de groupes therapeutiques specifiques est a discuter.

Loss of desire and dissatisfaction with their sexual life is encountered in both genders. Hypersexuality (HS), erectile dysfunction and problems with ejaculation are found in male patients, and loss of lubrication and involuntary urination during sex are found in female patients. Tremor, hypomimia, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, 'clumsiness' in fine motor control, dyskinesias, hypersalivation and sweating may interfere with sexual function. Optimal dopaminergic treatment should facilitate sexual encounters of the couple. Appropriate counselling diminishes some of the problems (reluctance to engage in sex, problems with ejaculation, lubrication and urinary incontinence). Treatment of erectile dysfunction with sildenafil and apomorphine is evidence based. HS or compulsive sexual behaviour are side effects of dopaminergic therapy, particularly by dopaminergic agonists, and should be treated primarily by diminishing their dose. Neurologists should actively investigate sexual dysfunction in their Parkinsonian patients and offer treatment, optimally within a multidisciplinary team, where a dedicated professional would deal with sexual counselling.",

Several studies have identified abnormal serotonergic parameters during the entire menstrual cycle and the luteal phase in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.‘ s p t t h t D h a r T t s c Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a combination of emotional, behavioral and physical symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, abate shortly after the onset of menses, and cause impairment in social and role functioning [1]. The hallmark emotional symptoms of PMDD include irritability, anxiety or tension, mood swings and depressed mood. PMDD occurs in approximately 5% of menstruating women and is considered the severe end of the spectrum of clinically significant premenstrual symptoms. Reduced quality of life (QoL), increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity at work have been documented in women with PMDD [2,3]. Recent reviews and expert guidelines summarize the diagnostic criteria, recommended forms for the prospective daily charting of symptoms and the importance of identifying a premenstrual exacerbation of an underlying mood or medical illness prior to the initiation of treatment [4–7]. The etiology of PMDD is likely to be multifactorial, and many possible etiological factors have been reviewed [8]. It is assumed that ovulation-related mechanisms trigger premenstrual symptoms in women with a vulnerability to CNS dysregulation [9]. Several studies have identified abnormal serotonergic parameters during the entire menstrual cycle and the luteal phase in women with PMDD [8]. Studies also suggest an abnormal response to allopregnanolone and other γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic agonists during the luteal phase of the cycle [10]. The",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "abstract": "Most people die when they are old, but predicting exactly when this will occur is unavoidably uncertain. The health of older people is challenged by multimorbidity, disability and frailty. Frailty is the tendency to crises or episodes of rapid deterioration. These are often functional or non-specific in nature, such as falls or delirium, and recovery is usually expected. Health-related problems can be defined in terms of distress and disability. Distress is as often mental as physical, especially for people with delirium and dementia. Problems can be addressed using the principles of supportive and palliative care, but there is rarely a simple solution. Most problems do not have a palliative drug treatment, and the propensity to adverse effects means that drugs must be used with caution. Geriatricians use a model called comprehensive geriatric assessment, including medical, functional, mental health, social and environmental dimensions, but also use a variety of other models, such as the acute medical model, person-centred care, rehabilitation, alongside palliative care. Features such as communication, family engagement and advance planning are common to them all. These approaches are often consistent with each other, but their commonalities are not always recognised. The emphasis should be on making the right decision at a given point in time, taking account of what treatment is likely to deliver benefit, treatment burden and what is wanted. Choices are often limited by what is available and feasible. Palliative care should be integrated with all medical care for frail older people.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of spirituality and religiosity are studied in the context of cardiac disease and prevention. In psychology, psychosomatics, psychocardiology, spirituality is studied as a feature of human experience, attributed to certain transcendental ideas. Religiosity is a part of a person's self-identification, influencing his experience of interaction with medicine, and more broadly, in general, his worldview and conceptualizations. Spirituality and religiosity are culturally specific, in particular, in Russia, where society has historically formed stereotypes of attitudes on God and other inaccessible ideas. Thus, the Russian society is characterized by lay religiosity, which includes Eastern Orthodox metaphysics along with paganism. In practical cardiology, the concepts of spirituality and religiosity can be realized explicitly (manifestation of faith by a patient and a doctor) and implicitly, without manifestation. Spirituality and religiosity can influence patient adherence, decision making, and more complex psychosomatic processes. Spirituality and religiosity can be a salutogenic factor, which promotes health, improves the psychological and physical state. But they can also mediate morbid effects if a doctor incorrectly addresses them during communication with a patient. Spirituality and religiosity are a part of complex downward system of somatic manifestation of cultural and social factors, the study and consideration of which is obvious in practice.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable psychiatric condition, that is, associated with lifelong distress and impairment. There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents. A comparative analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials in youth BD established that atypical antipsychotics have better efficacy and tolerability compared with anticonvulsants and lithium (effect size atypical antipsychotics 0.65, CI 0.53 to 0.78 vs …",

      "abstract": "The history is presented of an emotionally rigid, sensitive, and dependent person with considerable repressed aggression, who experienced recurrent episodes of confusion, dyskinetic movement and uninhibited emotional behavior. Initially diagnosed as hysterical fugue states, further observation and study determined that these phenomena were associated with hypoglycemia due to a benignislet cell adenoma of the pancreas. Following removal of the adenoma, these episodes were eliminated, although the essential nature of his personality structure remained unchanged. Attention is drawn to the fact that diagnostic error occurs frequently in the study of the neurotic person; that the principal sources of error lie in methods directed toward exclusion of positive data related to physical disease or psychosis. The need for the establishment of positive evidences of neurotic personality structure is emphasized. The relationship between the basic physiologic dysfunction (decreased cerebral metabolism) and the resultant intellectual, motor and emotional behavior is discussed. It is suggested that inhibition and repression may be the physiologic and psychologic expressions of a basic phenomenon. With loss or impairment of either, as in this patient, and possibly in all delirious patients, there is evidenced release of concrete intellectual activity, less integrated neurologic behavior and less repressed emotional expression. A further consideration was the relationship of this patient's behavior in particular to the problem of delirium in general. As in all deliria, the primary psychologic disturbance lay in the level of awareness. This disturbance of consciousness, together with the varied neurologic symptomatology, is of a more or less impersonal nature. The emotional behavior dependent for its expression on the degree of disturbance of consciousness is more individualized and specific, not to the noxious stimulus, but to the personality structure of the delirious patient.",

Many clinicians question the advisability of treating a persistent primary amenorrhea since the establishment of autonomous function cannot readily be expected with the available means of therapy (1–4). It is noteworthy that cases of this type are seriously handicapped both psychologically and sociologically. There is a persistent request and need for any treatment, regardless of its limitations, which might enable these patients to cope with their handicaps. Cyclical uterine bleeding or menstruation can be induced in any type of functional amenorrhea with adequate dosage of estrogens and progestogens (5–9).

      "title": "When depression envelops frontotemporal dementia: The differential diagnostic frame through a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is common in presenile population. The overlapping symptoms with other psychiatric disorders can lead to wrong/late diagnosis which cause delays/difficulties regarding case-management. Especially, long-standing and/or late-onset depression can descriptively envelop bvFTD (behavioral-variant) and leads to unnecessary treatments and increased distress. It’s important to implement a descriptive diagnostic algorithm which will help clinicians to distinguish the phenomenology of these disorders. Objectives This presentation aims to call attention of the clinicians/researchers to an elaborated effort concerning differential diagnosis of two common disorders with overlapping features through a case-study of a 59-year-old male patient. Methods One case from an inpatient unit of a psychiatric clinic in Lower Saxony, Germany will be reported. Results Case: The patient was referred to our acute-psychiatric-ward from the day-clinic-unit because of treatment-resistant, severe and long-lasting depressive symptoms. He was depressed, desperate, hopeless, listless and had suicidal thoughts. During the first days of treatment, symptoms like apathy, bad hygiene, weird eating-behavior, urinary incontinence, lack of empathy, language disorders and other behavioral symptoms were evident. Brain-MRI yielded frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Trail-Making-Test and Frontal-Assessment-Battery showed pronounced impairment of executive functions. Mini mental state examination and DemTect yielded light to moderate memory dysfunction. Diagnostic Criteria for Probable bvFTD (International-Consensus-Criteria) were fulfilled. Conclusions The diagnosis of bvFTD enabled a rapid assignment of a legal representative and relieved the long-lasting discomfort of the patient and his family that was caused by multiple unsuccessful treatment trials against depression. The differential diagnostic frame between bvFTD and depression will be discussed in view of the current literature. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

Family physicians must be proactive in diagnosing and managing the alterations in sexual functioning that can occur with chronic illness. Patient education and reassurance are essential. Before sexual activity is resumed, patients with cardiovascular disease should be stratified according to risk. Patients with musculoskeletal disease should be educated about positional changes that may improve comfort during sexual activity.

Multisystem adaptations in brain, body, behavioral, and social function may contribute to a dysregulated physiological state that is maintained beyond the homeostatic range. In addition, chronic abuse of substances leads to an altered set point across multiple systems. Resilience can be defined as the absence of psychopathology despite exposure to high stress and reflects a person's ability to cope successfully in the face of adversity, demonstrating adaptive psychological and physiological stress responses. The study of resilience can be approached by examining interindividual stress responsibility at multiple phenotypic levels, ranging from psychological differences in the way people cope with stress to differences in neurochemical or neural circuitry function. The ultimate goal of such research is the development of strategies and interventions to enhance resilience and coping in the face of stress and prevent the onset of addiction problems or relapse.",

While nonpain symptoms such as fatigue, sleep, dyspnea, anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, nausea, and anorexia-cachexia are commonly noted by patients and clinicians, research quantifying their effects on quality of life, function, and other outcomes are lacking and there is scant evidence regarding management. Most available studies have focused on relatively narrow conditions (e.g., chemotherapy-induced nausea) and there are almost no data relevant to patients with multiple morbidities or multiple concurrent symptoms. Assessment and treatment of nonpain symptoms in older adults with serious illness and multiple comorbidities is compromised by the lack of data relevant to their care. Recommended research priorities address the documented high prevalence of distressing symptoms in older adults with serious illness, the unique needs of this population due to coexistence of multiple chronic conditions along with physiologic changes related to aging, the lack of evidence for effective pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, and the need for validated measures that are relevant across multiple care settings.",

Women's orgasms can be induced by erotic stimulation of a variety of genital and nongenital sites. As of yet, no definitive explanations for what triggers orgasm have emerged. Studies of brain imaging indicate increased activation at orgasm, compared to pre-orgasm, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray of the midbrain, hippocampus, and the cerebellum. Psychosocial factors commonly discussed in relation to female orgasmic ability include age, education, social class, religion, personality, and relationship issues. Findings from surveys and clinical reports suggest that orgasm problems are the second most frequently reported sexual problems in women. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for anorgasmia focuses on promoting changes in attitudes and sexually relevant thoughts, decreasing anxiety, and increasing orgasmic ability and satisfaction. To date there are no pharmacological agents proven to be beneficial beyond placebo in enhancing orgasmic function in women.",

Przedstawiono modyfikacje kryteriów diagnostycznych oraz opartych na nich metod badania. Stosowanie tylko metod przesiewowych powoduje przeszacowanie lub niedoszacowanie występowania zjawiska ADHD u dorosłych, z tego powodu wymagana jest rzetelna diagnoza psychiatryczna. Wśród dorosłych z ADHD bardzo często występują dodatkowe zaburzenia takie jak: zaburzeń zachowania, zaburzeń emocjonalnych, uzależnień od alkoholu i/lub narkotyków, zaburzeń osobowości i nasilonych trudności w codziennym funkcjonowaniu. Rezultaty badań na temat zależności między występowaniem ADHD i przestępczości sugerują, że tylko w przypadku bardzo ciężkiej postaci ADHD wymagającej leczenia farmakologicznego można uznać istnienie takiej zależności. W pozostałych przypadkach należy analizować ten problem w kontekście współwystępujących zaburzeń i doświadczeń życiowych. Konieczne jest opracowanie przewodnika diagnostycznego w zakresie ADHD u dorosłych.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Measuring psychosocial outcome is good",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review Poor psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia can be conceptualized as an early indicator of chronic neurodevelopmental illness. Alternatively, impaired psychosocial functioning could be the result of social and environmental factors associated with the onset of psychotic illness. We review recent evidence on psychosocial outcome in the early phases of psychotic illness, when young people are less removed from their developmental trajectory, any brain changes may be mutable and there may be greater opportunity for intervention. Recent findings In samples with first-episode psychosis, poor premorbid functioning, stable negative symptoms and impaired social cognition and neurocognition may indicate individuals likely to experience poor psychosocial outcome. There is also some evidence of social/environmental predictors of poor outcome. Recent findings from at-risk samples suggest similar patterns, although more research is needed. Summary It is likely that for some patients poor psychosocial outcome is the result of longstanding neurological changes, whereas for others it is related to the secondary consequences of having psychosis. We suggest that measuring psychosocial outcome in the early stages of psychosis is important for our understanding of the cause of schizophrenia, but argue for the importance of the patient's subjective view on their psychosocial recovery.",

      "abstract": "As people live longer, the burden of cognitive impairment to elderly patients, their families and society becomes increasingly common and important. The loss of independence, a reduction in the quality of life and increased mortality are possible correlates to the mental disintegration. Cognitive dysfunction following major surgery on the elderly is a significant problem which adds to other cognitive impairments caused by neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular impairments and other causes. There are challenges in reviewing the literature because of many methodological concerns. There is no standard definition; the diagnosis is made only by the results of neuropsychological tests which are not standardised for this purpose; test results are analysed by different statistical methods (some of them inappropriate); controls are often absent or poorly matched; and pre-existing mild cognitive impairment, which affects 10 to 20% of people older than 65 years and is similar to the subtle cognitive impairment following surgery, is not sought for and recognised. Reviews of the subject have varied from descriptions such as ‘a well recognised and significant problem’ to ‘a hypothetical phenomenon for which there is no International Statistical Classification of Disease (ICD-9) code, and no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) code’. This article examines both sides of the spectrum in a detailed review which explains the necessary psychological ‘jargon’, discusses the methods used and points to areas of future research.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "title": "Long-term Cognitive and Functional Impairments After Critical Illness",
      "abstract": "As critical illness survivorship increases, patients and health care providers are faced with management of long-term sequelae including cognitive and functional impairment. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated impairments persisting at least 1–5 years after hospitalization for critical illness. Cognitive domains impacted include memory, attention, and processing speed. Functional impairments include physical weakness, reduced endurance, and dependence on others for basic tasks of daily living such as bathing or feeding. In characterizing the trajectory of long-term recovery, multiple risk factors have been identified for subsequent impairment, including increased severity of illness and severe sepsis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and delirium. Preadmission status including frailty, high level of preexisting comorbidities, and baseline cognitive dysfunction are also associated with impairment after critical illness. Development of cognitive and functional impairment is likely multifactorial, and multiple mechanistic theories have been proposed. Neuroinflammation, disruption of the blood–brain barrier, and structural alterations in the brain have all been observed in patients with long-term cognitive dysfunction. Systemic inflammation has also been associated with alterations in muscle integrity and function, which is associated with intensive care unit–acquired weakness and prolonged functional impairment. Efforts to ease the burden of long-term impairments include prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions after discharge. Delirium is a well-established risk factor for long-term cognitive dysfunction, and using delirium-prevention strategies may be important for cognitive protection. Current evidence favors minimizing overall sedation exposure, careful selection of sedation agents including avoidance of benzodiazepines, and targeted sedation goals to avoid oversedation. Daily awakening and spontaneous breathing trials and early mobilization have shown benefit in both cognitive and functional outcomes. Multifactorial prevention bundles are useful tools in improving care provided to patients in the intensive care unit. Data regarding cognitive rehabilitation are limited, while studies on functional rehabilitation have conflicting results. Continued investigation and implementation of prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions will hopefully improve the quality of life for the ever-increasing population of critical illness survivors.",

Somatization is an individual's unconscious use of the body or bodily symptoms for psychological purposes or psychological gain. As the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, notes, somatization is a “tendency to experience and report somatic complaints (physical symptoms) in response to psychosocial stress and seek health care services for them.” The AMA Guides also advises evaluators that “exclusion or inclusion of somatization disorder, factitious disorder, and/or malingering must be done with care.” A table lists developmental factors that may dispose to somatization (eg, somatizers are present in the family of origin, or coping mechanisms other than illness behavior are absent or unacceptable); a second table compares disorders that may involve somatization. Somatization is prevalent in clinical practice and is likely to occur with equal, or higher, frequency in the evaluation setting. The presence of somatization distorts symptom presentation and can exert a confounding effect on impairment assessment methodologies that rely on the accuracy of patients’ self-presentations.",

      "abstract": "There are many patients with chronic pain who are referred from each of the clinical fields to the department of psychosomatic medicine. Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

A particular feature of such comorbidity is the significant impact of psycho-emotional disorders on the motivation and adherence of patients to a healthy lifestyle and various therapy options, which increases the risks of complications and, as a consequence of this, the healthcare expenditures. The topicality of the issues of screening and management of psycho-emotional disorders in the general practitioner practice is caused, on the one hand, by high rate of these disorders in patients with chronic non-communicable diseases, deterioration in quality of life and an increase in adverse outcomes, and on the other hand, inadequate awareness of the possibilities to manage the psycho-emotional state of patients with comorbidities. The therapy for psycho-emotional disorders includes both drug and non-drug methods, however, the effectiveness of such therapy in relation to the clinical course and prognosis in patients with different comorbidities is not the same. This review presents the most common comorbidities of psycho-emotional disorders and somatic diseases in therapeutic practice. A buspirone and tofisopam therapy for psycho-emotional disorders in patients with various comorbidities was discussed. The efficacy and safety of tofisopam and buspirone have been studied in numerous studies in patients with chronic diseases and a wide range of anxiety disorders, including a long-term administration.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

Similar positive effects on symptoms have been found in anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Therefore, assessing and promoting physical activity is advisable in clinical psychiatric practice. Patients should be coached to reach at least a weekly average of 150 minutes of moderate and/or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Infertility is a serious health issue which affects milions of couples on the world. The dynamics of partnerships and social functioning, the effect of infertility on people's mental health, with a focus on family and gender disparities, are some of the most thorough literature evaluations. Methods: This review was based on about 63 scientific publications from the last years including meta-analyses, original works and systematic reviews. The most important topics discussed: various mental disorders related to infertility and their consequences, partner relationships, impact of treatment, social and family functioning. Conclusions: There is a clear correlation between infertility and increased psychological distress, specifically stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. The length of infertility and the failure of reproductive therapies can cause the emotional strain to increase. Because long-term stress, worry, and depression can interfere with menstrual cycles, hormone control, and sexual function, psychiatric illnesses may also be a contributing factor to infertility. Assisted reproductive technologies [ART] can be a source of psychological stress as well as hope. The emotional fluctuations linked to ART highlight the necessity of ongoing psychological care during the course of treatment. Key words: infertility, psychiatric disorders, mental health, reproductive treatment, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive symptoms",

Although the patient's overtly sexualized self-injury was like that seen in psychotic individuals, a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder was not appropriate in this case. The case is also unusual because the patient's self-mutilation was responsive to treatment. Self-mutilation is often difficult to treat, but this case shows that, at least in the context of some disorders, a multifaceted treatment approach may be effective in reducing this behavior.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An occasion of drug taking may be a passing indulgence of an adolescent, perhaps initiated in a moment of immature judgment. All too often, the drug taking can become repetitive and may lead to a syndrome of abuse or addiction, possibly in an interaction of inherited vulnerability traits with environmental conditions and processes. The development of addiction and the dependence syndrome in adolescents are emotion-laden, controversial, and often misunderstood topics. Public opinion leaders often do not appreciate the scientific evidence that tends to favor a disease concept of addiction or dependence on alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs such as cocaine or cannabis. This evidence includes a neuronal basis for many of the prominent clinical features of dependence, genetic vulnerability, and a characteristic chronic, relapsing course that resembles that of many medical illnesses. Unfortunately, these biological bases of addiction are often forgotten or misunderstood by a nonetheless opinionated American public that can view adolescent drug problems as purely behavioral and morally objectionable. Consequently, many affected adolescents end up being managed by their parents, school authorities, or the judicial system rather than being treated in specialized adolescent treatment programs. Even those seeking treatment often discover that appropriate programs do not exist in their geographic region or are difficult to access because of low capacity or managed care policies. While there would be a public uproar if treatment were not available to adolescents with head injuries, diabetes, or cancer, obvious disparities in addiction treatment have been tolerated for decades and may well reflect public skepticism about the biological bases of drug dependence and addiction. Unfortunately,we have much to learn about the onset, nature, and treatment of these conditions in adolescents. It is our contention that gaps in our knowledge should be addressed with research and clinical experience, and not cited to justify an inadequate treatment infrastructure.",

      "title": "Growth at adolescence. Clinical correlates.",
      "abstract": "Several highly significant changes occur within a relatively short period of time during adolescence. Great alteration in physique, developmental progress in thinking, and psychologic gains toward attaining ego identity take place but not always synchronously. Attention is paid to physical changes because they are visible and are of intense concern to adolescents, but physicians and other professionals should remember cognitive and psychosocial growth are affected by physical growth, and vice versa. Often there is a temporary disequilibrium in the relationship of these three areas of growth, and this can affect one or another part of the developmental pattern. It is therefore necessary to remind ourselves of the diversity of adolescent growth, and of adolescents, when caring for a young patient and be cognizant of growth in areas other than physical. More and more children with congenital or acquired handicaps are living to become adolescents and perhaps adults. Handicaps can be limited to one of the three major areas of growth or involve them all in varying degrees. For example, sickle cell disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis may postpone physical growth for a significant period; this lack of pubertal change can affect psychosocial development but usually does not impair cognitive growth. Mental retardation may have no apparent effect on physical growth but can handicap the adolescent's psychosocial development. Growth still occurs in a sequential pattern but often it seems that handicapped youngsters reach a developmental milestone by a series of \"detours.\" Physicians must recognize these lags or differences and try to facilitate progress, promote self-esteem, and provide understanding. Much can be done with anticipatory guidance. Adolescence often provides the opportunity to overcome past damage or, in some instances, to start anew on a more optimal program for physical and psychosocial growth. Young adolescent boys and girls usually look to the physician for factual information and guidance; they long for understanding by an adult outside of the family. If we can successfully fill their expectations, adolescents will be the better for it.",

Mortality rates from unnatural causes such as suicide are elevated in this group, but premature deaths are primarily the result of treatable physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the poor physical health of adults with psychosis and the need to focus on interventions to enhance the mental and physical health of this often neglected population are considered.",

      "abstract": "The author fundamentally questions the traditional concept of the disease-entity (or several disease entities) of 'schizophrenia' and discusses an alternative concept, based on vulnerability and information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first, premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid 'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees, which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly delimitable disease entity of schizophrenia with constant causes, psychopathological picture, or course, but rather a multi-conditioned life-process, occurring in people with a particular vulnerability, interacting with complex life-events and circumstances. This new concept has important consequences for therapy and prevention.",

The most common are: concentration and memory problems, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, joint pain, sleep disturbances, headache. Moreover, autonomic nervous system functioning and post-exertional malaise examination is considered to be important in diagnosis of adolescent patients with ME/CFS. The presented analysis of research shows that adolescents with ME/CFS urge to be understood and believed regarding an illness that few understood. Continuing education and remaining the social activity in young ME/CFS patients seems to be crucial in maintaining quality of life. ME/CFS in adolescents might lead to significant problems related to the school absenteeism, poorer quality of life at school, school and academic achievement compared to healthy adolescents. Anxiety might co-occur with ME/CFS in adolescents. Supportive therapy for comorbidities could be considered, if needed. However, there is no established effective treatment for ME/CFS, for which there is urgent need. (JNNN 2020;9(2):76–79)",

Individuals with BDD suffer from time-consuming obsessions about their bodily appearance and excessive compulsive behaviors (for example, mirror-checking, excessive grooming, and skin-picking). Functioning and quality of life are typically very poor, and suicidality is markedly elevated. BDD currently affects 0.7% to 2.9% of the population; however, BDD typically goes unrecognized in clinical settings. This chapter discusses BDD’s definition and classification, epidemiology, demographics, and clinical features, including several case descriptions of BDD, age at onset, course of illness, comorbidity, morbidity (including suicidality), gender similarities and differences, and healthcare utilization. In addition, BDD’s relationships to obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, and social anxiety disorder are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a universal experience, which affects approximately 15 percent of the population at any one time. Depression can be conceptualized as occurring on a continuum from first-level transitory to middle-level to severe-level depression. It involves an alteration in mood characterized by feelings of sadness and loss of interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, the client's usual activities and pastimes. Alterations in thought, motor activity, somatic sensations, and social relationships are also associated with depression. Severe depression can also be associated with delusional thought patterns. Finally, depression can vary in length of duration; it can be transitory and short-lived or ongoing and chronic. Assessment of individual, family, and community factors is important in identifying the factors relevant to planning individualized care for the depressed client and his/her family. Nursing diagnosis includes problems of low self-esteem, feelings of despondency, suicidal thoughts/impulses, and vegetative signs of depression. Nursing interventions are guided by certain principles, and are best evaluated when expected client behaviors have been projected. In conclusion, the overwhelming majority of those who experience depression recover and achieve a higher level of wellness than before the depression; that is, if they use the opportunity to develop a more realistic view of self, others, and their world relationships.",

      "abstract": "Male sexual dysfunction refers to a phenomenon in which a man experiences difficulty at any stage during the process of sexual intercourse. In general, erectile dysfunction is regarded as the most representative form of sexual dysfunction, but various other diseases can also be categorized as male sexual dysfunction, including sexual arousal disorder, decreased libido, ejaculation disorder, and Peyronie's disease. Causes of sexual dysfunction include chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. In addition, some medications, surgical procedures, and traumas can cause sexual dysfunction. However, aging is the most important cause of male sexual dysfunction. To diagnose and treat elderly patients who complain of male sexual dysfunction, it is first necessary to become familiar with the characteristics of sexual dysfunction in elderly men. The prevalence rates of metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, stroke, and depression are higher among elderly men than among younger men; furthermore, the elderly are at a higher risk for the development of kidney, hepatic, spinal cord, and neurological diseases. Notably, anti-hypertensive agents can affect erectile function in elderly men: sexual dysfunction may be severe or the response to treatment may be poor. For satisfactory treatment, spousal factors should also be considered.",

      "abstract": "Childhood depression is a serious psychiatric disorder that is usually manifested as a low mood accompanied by a variety of other symptoms including attention deficit, irritability, restlessness, fidgeting, aggressive behavior, academic burnout, truancy and (in some cases) suicidal behavior. Depression can seriously impact a child’s academic achievement, social interactions and other aspects of their daily lives. [1] The reported prevalence of depression is 1 to 2% in prepubescent children, 3 to 8% in younger teenagers and 14% in teenagers aged 15 to 18; overall, it is estimated that 20% of the population will experience at least one episode of depression prior to the age of 18. [2] During childhood there is no significant gender difference in the prevalence of depression, but after puberty female rates of depression become higher than those for males. [3] The etiology of childhood depression remains unclear: it may be caused by the interaction of various risk factors and protective factors including genetic predisposition, abnormalities of the structure and function of the brain, psychological and physiological stressors, poor parental relationships, and so forth.

      "title": "Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The role of mood stabilizers",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with symptoms that extend far beyond cognitive deficits. The most distressing of these symptoms are known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and include delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression, misidentification, and sexually inappropriate behaviors. As a result of BPSD, AD patients suffer a poorer quality of life, as do their caregivers.1 Behavioral and psychological symptoms can be so distressing to the caregiver that they are a common reason for families placing their loved ones in long-term care. Approximately 60% and 80% of dementia patients living in the community and in long-term care settings develop BPSD, respectively.1Aggression and agitation are characterized by increased or disruptive psychomotor activity, inappropriate verbal activity, or disorganized motor activity that is not explained by the patient's needs. Often times, dementia patients present with aggression and agitation as well as psychotic symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have been the most widely studied agents for the management of psychotic symptoms as well as aggression and agitation.1 Despite their noted efficacy for BPSD, their use has been curtailed over recent years due to concerns about an increase in cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with their use. This has led to an ongoing search for other effective pharmacologic treatments for BPSD. Several mood stabilizers including valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate have been studied in dementia patients. This paper aims to present the data on the efficacy of mood stabilizing drugs for the management of BPSD.In 2007, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) developed a white paper on the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia for the purpose of treating psychosis and agitation.1 This paper also reviewed the use of numerous other psychotropic drugs in this population. Evidence for atypical antipsychotic efficacy in psychosis of dementia indicated that these agents have modest efficacy. The data are difficult to interpret because these studies often included patients with psychosis and agitation. To further complicate the studies, the primary outcome was often a measure of global psychiatric symptoms, not a rating scale to assess psychosis or agitation only. There have been very few studies evaluating the use of atypical antipsychotics for agitation only. This is partly due to the fact it is difficult to recruit dementia patients with agitation only since it frequently overlaps with psychosis. Agents such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have reportedly shown some benefit for agitation in dementia patients.Nearly 10 years ago, the FDA issued a warning regarding cerebrovascular events (CVEs) such as strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) associated with the use of risperidone. Soon after, the FDA evaluated CVE's with other atypical antipsychotics and the warning was added to olanzapine and aripiprazole. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data indicated that the rates of CVEs were 1.9% for patients receiving atypical antipsychotics and 0.9% for placebo-treated patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–2.8). Of course there are limitations to these data, most notably of which is that these studies were not powered to evaluate the relationship between drug and adverse events; they were powered to evaluate efficacy. In addition, the definition of CVE is not defined in the studies, nor were these events validated. Lastly, there is likely no difference in the rates of CVEs between typical and atypical agents.In addition to the risk of CVEs, increased mortality rates in the elderly have been reported with atypical antipsychotics. These data led the FDA to issue a black box warning for antipsychotics in the elderly regarding the higher mortality rates, which were mostly due to cardiac or infectious disease. A meta-analysis reported that the elderly mortality rate was 3.5% with atypical agents compared to 2.3% with placebo. Again, there were numerous limitations cited including limited data regarding the circumstances around the deaths as well as controversy surrounding the mortality risk in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.The study known as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness for Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) evaluated the use of antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients under naturalistic conditions.2 Patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of treatment for any reason as well as minimal improvement as noted on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks. Patients reportedly discontinued quetiapine due to lack of efficacy after a mean of only 9.1 weeks compared to olanzapine and risperidone where patients continued treatment for a mean of 22.1 and 26.7 weeks, respectively. Patients discontinued all treatments earlier than placebo due to adverse events.In addition to reporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and agitation, the ACNP white paper also reported on the use of other psychotropic drugs for these symptoms.1 There were three trials that evaluated the efficacy of VPA for agitation or aggression in dementia patients.3–5 Two of the studies were completed in patients with agitation and one with patients with aggression. All three studies failed to show any benefit of VPA over placebo for management of aggression or agitation. Additionally, two trials evaluated the short-term (6 week) use of carbamazepine (CBZ) for agitation. Both CBZ trials were small (n of 51 and 21), and reported mixed results. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores indicated that CBZ was more effective than placebo in one study7 but no difference was found in the other.6 Olin and colleagues actually reported that there was a significant improvement on the hostility item of the BPRS but a worsening of the hallucination item in CBZ-treated patients.6 The authors also reported that their study lacked statistical power and that they would have needed 69 patients in order to confirm the findings regarding the total BPRS scores.6Unfortunately, the long-term use of CBZ is limited by its poor tolerability, including ataxia and disorientation, and the risk of significant drug-drug interactions.Since the publication of the ACNP white paper, there has been one further study that evaluated the efficacy of VPA in agitation and aggression.8 This study included patients with moderate to severe AD and were experiencing agitation or aggression based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scores (NPI). Patients had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV)9 criteria for AD, have a mini-mental status exam (MMSE) score of < 15, and an NPI > 8. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 2 week wash-out period. Forty patients were referred, but consent was obtained from only 16. Two patients dropped out prior to enrollment, leaving 14 in the study (8M, 6F). Prior to starting the study, patients underwent a wash-out of current psychotropic medications for a period equal to 5 half-lives of the drugs. Treatment was initiated with VPA 125 mg twice per day for one week and increased to 500 mg twice per day during week two. The dose was increased according to symptom response and patient tolerability to a maximum of 1,500 mg per day. The dose could be decreased, as needed. Loxapine 2.5 mg up to 4 doses per week was permitted as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was the NPI agitation score. Secondary measures were the NPI total score and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Wilcoxon signed ranks tests comparing the change in scores for VPA vs. placebo.The results indicated that the NPI agitation scores decreased for VPA-treated patients and increased for placebo-treated patients (1.43+/−3.87 vs-2.08 +/−4.05, p=0.043). The change in scores for the VPA group represents a worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was also seen on the total NPI and CMAI scores, but was significant only for the CMAI (NPI p=0.075 and CMAI p=0.039). Twelve VPA patients had adverse effects such as falls (5), sedation (4), thrombocytopenia (2), and loose stools (2). The placebo group had 2 patients with sedation and 1 fall. The conclusion is that VPA was ineffective for agitation and aggression and was poorly tolerated in elderly AD patients.A second study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of VPA for preventing agitation and aggression in AD patients.10 Patients had to meet criteria for possible or probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke AND the Alzheimer's Diseaseand Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA), have a MMSE of 12–20, and be free from agitation or psychosis as defined by NPI < 1 on items assessing delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm flexible-dose study. Patients received VPA for two years in a double-blind fashion, and then had a two-month, single-blind placebo treatment period. The VPA target dose was 10–12 mg/kg and used identical appearing VPA and placebo tablets. The primary outcome was defined as the development of a score of at least 3 on one or more NPI items assessing delusions, hallucinations, and agitation for 2 weeks. Other scales used to assess secondary outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), CMAI, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living), the Quality of Life-AD, and the ADCS Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary endpoint was evaluated using the cox proportional hazards model comparing time to end point in the drug and placebo groups and adjusted for variables such as age, sex, baseline MMSE, total NPI, total CMAI, and ADCS-Activities of Daily Living. All assessments were completed at baseline, and every three months until the 24th month, then at month 26. Five hundred thirteen patients were screened and 313 were randomized. At enrollment, the mean MMSE in both groups was 16.9 and the NPI subscales for agitation, delusions, and hallucinations were < 1.0. The mean modal dose of VPA was 250 mg/day and the mean VPA level at 12 months was 42.7 mcg/ml. Sixty-one percent of VPA and 62% of placebo patients discontinued treatment early. The time to the primary endpoint did not differ between the two groups (p=0.88). Twenty-nine placebo and 25 VPA patients reached the endpoint. The mean change in ADAS-cog scores indicated that there were some differences that favored placebo (VPA 9.4, PLC 6.8, p=0.01). The ADCS Activities of Daily Living scores at 18 months also favored placebo (VPA-19.3, PLC-14.4, p=0.02). More VPA than placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (16% vs 7.5%). This study failed to show any benefit of VPA in preventing the development of agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.Due to the intolerability and drug interactions noted in carbamazepine trials as well as the lack of efficacy reported with VPA, other mood stabilizers have been evaluated for controlling BPSD. Topiramate (TOP) is a viable option secondary to its reported efficacy in controlling irritability and aggression in other psychiatric populations.11 However, there is concern with the use of TOP in the dementia population due to cognitive decline reported with its use.To date, there is only one published, prospective trial of TOP for aggression in dementia patients.12 This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing topiramate to risperidone (RIS) that included 48 patients with mild to moderate severity of AD defined by an MMSE score of 10–26. Patients were included if they had a complaint of behavioral disturbances and had an NPI score of greater than 1 in sub-items relating to delusions; hallucinations; agitation and aggression; and irritability and lability. Topiramate was initiated at 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks. Risperidone was initiated at 0.25 mg/day with a doubling in dose every week until target dose of 2 mg/day was achieved. In both groups, the dose could be reduced if adverse events occurred. The mean daily dose of TOP was 44.0 mg and RIS was 1.9 mg. Any improvement on NPI parts 1 and 2 or the CMAI were considered the primary outcomes. Part 1 of the NPI assesses behavioral disturbances and affective and psychotic symptoms; part 2 assesses caregiver burden and distress. Cognitive function was assessed with the MMSE.Forty eight patients were enrolled, but 41 completed the trial. Seven patients dropped out due to adverse events; fatigue and loss of appetite were reported in the TOP group and GI disturbance and akathisia in the RIS group. Both groups showed improvements in the NPI parts 1 and 2 from baseline to week 8. However, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups (NPI part I: P<0.575, NPI part 2: P<0.456). Both groups also showed a decrease in agitation as assessed by CMAI scores but no statistically significant difference noted (P<0.927). Cognitive status on the MMSE was not found to change significantly in either group (P<0.479). In conclusion, the authors found that low dose TOP had comparable efficacy to RIS in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia. However, nearly 15% failed to complete the study due to adverse events.Carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating BPSD, but carries a high risk for adverse events and drug-drug interactions.1 Oxcarbazepine(OXC) has been hypothesized to be efficacious as it has a similar structure to carbamazepine, but with better tolerability. There are case reports suggesting that oxcarbazepine may be beneficial in treating BPSD. To formally evaluate the efficacy of OXC for BPSD, an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with a diagnosis of AD, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia was conducted.13 This study included patients with moderate to severe dementia as defined by a MMSE of 0–20, a history of agitation or aggression for at least 1 week, a score of 6 or greater on Neurospychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) subscale for agitation and aggression, and were in a nursing home for at least 4 weeks. Patients who were receiving psychotropic medications prior to the study could not have dose changes within 2 weeks before and throughout the study. New psychotropic agents could not be initiated during the study except for haloperidol if needed as a rescue medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive OXC 300–900 mg/day or placebo. Oxcarbazepine was initiated at 75 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening with dose increases up to a total of 900 mg/day after 3 weeks with the highest, well-tolerated dose maintained. The mean daily dose of OXC was 536.6 mg/day. The primary outcome was the change in the agitation and aggression subscore of NPI-NH. Secondary outcomes included change in agitation measured by the Brief Agitation Rating Scale (BARS) and change in burden of care measured by NPI-NH.A total of 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication with 83 patients completing the study. No significant difference was found between groups for any of the outcomes assessed regardless of whether the intention to treat or per protocol population analysis was used (NPI-NH agitation and aggression subscore P=0.70, BARS P=0.07, NPI-NH P=0.58). Interestingly, there was also no significant difference between groups in the use of haloperidol (P=0.26). The most common side effects occurring in the active treatment group included urinary tract infections, falls, a decrease in serum sodium, ataxia, fainting, and sedation. In conclusion, the study failed to show any benefit of OXC for the management of agitation or aggression in patients with moderate to severe dementia.There have been some smaller, open studies and case studies published on this topic involving other mood stabilizers not already mentioned in this review. A recent case series showed benefit with low dose gabapentin 200–600 mg/day in treating aggressive behavior in seven patients with the vascular or mixed dementia.14 Gabapentin was well tolerated and produced sustained results at follow up varying from 2–6 months.14Lamotrigine has shown to be effective and well-tolerated over six months in a case report of a patient diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia who was demonstrating verbal and physical aggression.15 Another case series of five patients with dementia, manic-like symptoms, and agitation treated with lamotrigine reported improvements on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) after five months of treatment.16 None of the patients had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events.Two small, open-label trials with less than 20 patients each reported the effectiveness of levetiracetam for the management of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Both trials found significant improvement from baseline in the NPI and YMRS.17,18 One report indicated that three patients required a dose reduction of levetiracetam as two patients experienced lethargy and one had an increase in agitation.17 The second study noted that no patient had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, but did not mention if any dose reductions were required.18Since the publication of the ACNP White Paper in 2007, there have only been three randomized clinical trials studying mood stabilizers for treatment of BPSD. Low-dose TOP and RIS were reported to be equally effective for BPSD. Prospective, placebo-controlled trials of OXC and VPA failed to show any benefit in patients with BPSD. Open trials and case studies have shown some limited effectiveness for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam and require further evaluation in a controlled setting.Due to a paucity of data indicating efficacy and safety, no mood stabilizer is currently FDA approved for the management of BPSD. If a mood stabilizer is indicated for patients with dementia showing aggressive or agitated behavior, their use should only be considered in cases where the symptoms pose serious risk to the patient or their caregivers. Antipsychotics have the most data indicating some moderate efficacy for BPSD, but their use is associated with serious adverse events, like CVEs, and an increased mortality in the elderly. Carbamazepine also has reported mixed efficacy but is associated with poor tolerability and a risk of drug-drug interactions. Gabapentin, lamotrigine and levetiracetam may hold promise, but further research using placebo controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made with these agents. Overall, no single pharmacologic agent has shown efficacy and tolerability in the elderly patient with BPSD. Their use should be carefully considered on an individual basis in patients with clearly identified target symptoms followed by close monitoring for improvement.",

Both severity of the sensory symptoms and periodic legs movements during sleep (PLMS) contribute to sleep impairment and, consequently, to a reduced quality of life (QoL). Measurement of RLS impact on QoL is made, both in clinical and epidemiological studies, by means of a Short Form-36 (SF-36) of health survey questionnaire and by validated and disease-specific QoL scales (RLSQoL and Hopkins RLSQoL). Both types of measures indicated a significant impact of RLS on QoL in different clinical and prevalence studies and showed good reliability, reproducibility and responsiveness. Moreover, QoL significantly improved, both in short-term studies and in recently published long-term protocols, with dopaminergic treatment in comparison to placebo. In what measure RLS per se, some disease-specific symptoms as restlessness and bad sleep or other co-morbidity factors, contribute to the impairment of QoL remain to be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "1. The constitutional psychopath or the psychopathic personality represents the most difficult group of all the mentally sick individuals with which the medical and legal professions have to deal. Particularly baffling are those psychopaths who show evidences of perversions in relation to their sexual drives. 2. The psychiatrist is in a position to recognize in many instances during the preadolescence years definite tendencies for these unstable children to incorporate into the framework of their disintegrated personalities sexual anomalies which are significant and have grave implications. We recognize that such individuals are not governed by the same inhibiting forces as the normal individual. They are impulsive, cunning, and unpredictable. They have no regrets, remorse, or sense of guilt about their asocial activities. They do not profit from experience, they are not restrained by punishment, and up to the present time they do not improve under treatment. 3. The case presented is an example of the personality type which is in need of serious consideration from both the medical and legal professions. 4. There seem to be two vitally important points which have not, as yet, been given sufficient consideration by those interested in psychiatry and criminology. (a) A statute should be enacted which would permit or require the court to have those suspected of sexual psychopathy submitted to psychiatric examination by two qualified psychiatrists in order to determine their responsibility. If the evidence of this examination is of such a nature as to convince the court of their irresponsibility because of sexual psychopathy they should be sent to an institution providing care for this type of individual. (b) The fact that no such institution exists at the present time brings up the need of providing an institution so organized that a thorough study might be made from every possible angle, medical, psychological, psychiatric. Let us turn our battery of tests on these individuals, study their behavior under strict supervision or modified supervision, but always supervision, until we have some assurance that they will not return to society only to repeat more serious offenses.",

OAB may be idiopathic or may occur with other common conditions such as bladder outlet obstruction, neurological disease, or stress incontinence. Primary care physicians may safely diagnose this condition by history and physical exam with a minimum of widely available lab tests. Management with behavioral therapies and pharmacotherapy is generally quite successful and warranted. Multiple anticholinergic medications are available and have been shown to be effective. Subtle differences in structure and mechanism of these agents may yield improved therapeutic benefit or tolerability and thus it is reasonable to try more than one drug to achieve the optimal results. For patients that fail behavioral and initial pharmacotherapy or when other complicating conditions are identified, referral to a specialist is indicated; however, the majority of patients with OAB do not require cystoscopy or urodynamics. Successful treatments for OAB do exist and it is worth screening for these disabling complaints at the primary care level.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a term that describes a decline in mental abilities, and is\r\nnot caused by a specific cause or a pathological process. It is the disease of\r\nthe cerebral cortex and surrounding structures of cells. It is characterized by\r\nprogressive and irreversible damage to nerve cells. The disease is long and\r\ndifficult, for now incurable, debilitating for patients and their families both\r\nphysically, emotionally and financially. There are wide range of symptoms\r\nmanifested as forgetfulness, disorientation in the time and space and the\r\ninability to independent living. The disease often leads to social isolation of\r\nthe patient and family, because patient behavior becomes unacceptable for\r\nsociety. Family members must be included in an adequate psychosocial\r\ntherapeutic treatment to execute and support, and will receive information\r\nand training on the characteristics, progress and prospects for the disease.\r\nThere is no single test to determine whether someone has dementia\r\nor not. Doctors diagnose dementia based on careful processing medical\r\nhistory, physical examination, laboratory tests and characteristic changes in\r\nthinking. Those with high reliability may determine that a person has\r\ndementia, but it is much more difficult to determine the exact type of\r\ndementia because the symptoms and changes in the brain of various\r\ndementia may overlap. In some cases, your doctor may diagnose dementia\r\nbut does not specify the type of it.\r\nTreatment depends on the cause of dementia. In most cases,\r\nprogressive dementia has no cure, but there are medicines that can\r\ntemporarily alleviate symptoms. The effectiveness of new treatments\r\ndepends on expensive researches and clinical studies.",

      "title": "Cambios en la psicopatología del trastorno limítrofe de la personalidad, en los pacientes tratados con psicoterapia psicodinámica",
      "abstract": "Summary There are very few studies on the changes in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) treated with psychodynamic psychotherapy, around the world, and as far as we know, this is the first report in Mexico on this subject. The main features of this disorder appear at 18 years of age (75% females; 25% males) and are frequent crises characterized by impulsivity (physical figths, substance abuse, suicide or selfmutilating behavior), affective instability (episodes of depression, anxiety and anger) and alterations in identity (sudden changes in values, vocational or laboral goals) that consume a lot of health resources and contribute to many failures in academic and work performance. Its treatment always needs some form of individual or group psychotherapy, with medication at times. In most of the clinical settings this disorder is considered as untractable or to take years to produce beneficial modifications. According to the epidemiological studies of several countries, this disorder appears in 1.1 to 4.6% in the general population, in 10% of the patients in ambulatory mental health centers, in 20% of the hospitalized psychiatric patients and in 30 to 60% of the patients with personality disorders. In a clinical psychiatric population in the Central Military Hospital (Mexico City) the prevalence was 35.7%. This paper reports changes observed in the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder treated by therapists trained in the Kernberg’s manualized psychodynamic psychotherapy, delivered in two weekly 45 minutes sessions, videorecorded and supervised once a week by experts. As for the therapists that participated in the study, four were psychoanalysts with a mean experience of 12 years (D.E. = 1.15) and 10 psychotherapists with a mean experience of 4.67 years (D.E. = 4.23). The experience of both groups of therapists was significately different (U = 7.5, p,.002). Nineteen patients were treated: four males and 15 females who met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria. Measurements of the psychopathology and global functioning were made at the beginning of the treatment, and every 24 sessions during a two years period, using the Clarkin’s Dimensional Scale of the DSM IV Borderline Personality Disorder, and the DSM IV Global Assessment of Functioning. The results were: a) Eleven patients no longer met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria at the 72 nd session measurement, b) there was a positive change in the severity of the psychopathology in all criteria along time, c) the impulsivity criteria disappeared at the 24 th session evaluation; affective instability criteria almost disappeared at the 48 th session evaluation, while identity alterations criteria had only minimal changes even in those patients that remained in treatment for almost two years, d) the gaining in the Global Assessment of Functioning from the beginning to the 72 nd session measurement was 70% and, f) there were no significative differences between the type of therapist and the improvement of the patient in the measurements. These results should be replicated and contrasted with randomized and comparative studies between this type of therapy and supportive psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, group therapy and medication in patients of other social classes treated by residents in psychiatry and clinical psychologists before making available this therapy to a wider patients population.",

On the other side, physical consequences, such as lower urinary tract symptoms, childhood vulvar lichen sclerosus and the typical symptoms resulting from child sexual abuse, will also be treated. Consequently, the aim is to examine how, despite the fact that both children who suffered sexual abuse and those who didn’t can exhibit the same problems, psychical and psychological, throughout adulthood, those who have been victims will always present a higher prevalence when it comes to develop those problems.",

The case presented is about a 21 year old man with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder who, after several admissions, was sent to the Rehabilitation Hospital Unit for stabilization and diagnostic study given the atypical features of his case. The psychopathological examination showed disorders in social relationships, psychomotricity and communications that had begun in his childhood. All these data, and the results of the biomedical and psychological diagnostic tests oriented us towards the presence of a dual diagnosis of Asperger's disorder and schizoaffective disorder.

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "More than most branches of medical practice child and adolescent psychiatry, increasingly described as child and adolescent mental health, is difficult to define. Central foci of the subject are the developmental, behavioural, and emotional disorders of childhood and adolescence. Many include “psychosomatic” physical symptoms, such as non-organic headache, stomach pains, and fatigue, in which stress or other environmental factors appear to play important causative and perpetuating roles. Delays and deviations in development, as well as general and specific learning problems, lie in the borderland of child psychiatric practice; educational and social services are often in the vanguard in providing support and services for affected individuals and their families. Environmental factors are often important in causation, and they are often, but by no means always, accompanied or followed by significant emotional and/or behavioural disturbance. Conversely, the importance of “constitutional” biological factors, in particular genetic factors, is increasingly being recognized. Most specialists in this field recognize the need for a biopsychosocial approach to child and adolescent mental health.Children's development is inextricably interwoven with parental and carer quality of care, failures of parenting and caring, and other possible acts of commission and omission. Thus fostering of parenting skills is often seen as an integral part of child psychiatric practice. Indeed, there are some child and adolescent psychiatrists who prefer to see themselves as family psychotherapists and perceive most, if not all, child mental health problems as being attributable to distortions or deficits in either parenting ability or familial interpersonal interactions. This can often be a helpful approach, but it is important to acknowledge that, although children's problems can often be formulated in terms of interactions between the child, the family, and the wider environment, in a significant number of cases (as in childhood autism for example) a serious primary disturbance does indeed lie within the child. This will of course interact critically with prevailing familial and other social factors.Defining the territory of child psychiatry in this way makes it clear that most professional assessment and treatment of child psychiatric disorders is carried out by non-psychiatrists, and often not even by medically qualified professionals. These include family doctors, paediatricians, and clinical medical officers, as well as psychologists (clinical and educational), nurses, social workers, nursery staff, and teachers. Situations which call for the particular skills of a child psychiatrist (Graham 1984) will vary. Generally, psychiatrists are most likely to be appropriately involved where the disorder is severely disabling, handicapping, and persistent, with significant degrees of functional impairment in development and quality of life. With training, other medical and non-medical professionals can be effective in assessing and treating problems in this field of work. This book aims to enable these individuals, as well as mental health professionals, to carry out these tasks more effectively.An important characteristic of child psychiatric disorders is the degree to which they affect different aspects of the child's and the family's lives. The family of a seriously disturbed child requires the services of many different professionals, drawn especially from health, education, and social welfare services. An important principle of practice involves the need for all practitioners, no matter to which discipline they belong, to respect the contribution that others make, to be aware of the point at which another discipline may need to be involved, to acknowledge when a professional with a different background, training, and even perspective may know better than you, and to maintain as close communication with other disciplines as is compatible with professional confidentiality and the highest ethical standards.",

Reports from psychophysical studies indicate that the most common declines with ageing are in vision and audition and, to a lesser degree, olfaction and gustation. Findings for the somatosensory system (mechanoreception, warming and cooling thermoreception and pain) are less conclusive. Factors that contribute to individual differences in sensory ratings beyond chronological ageing include stimulus factors including stimulus type and body location, response measures and instructions, systemic disease that may affect the peripheral or central nervous system and environmental factors that may affect the skin integrity.",

In fact no immediate dramatic cause has yet been demonstrated that would account for such mental breakdowns, and it would be surprising if it had, for the great majority of psychoses not related to maternity show no simple sequence of cause and effect. Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

Its aetiology is complex and multifactorial and includes surgical factors, anaesthetic factors, preexisting medical, psychiatric or psychological problems and postoperative complications. It often prolongs hospital stay and although mental function recovers in the majority of cases, it may be followed by permanent mental impairment. Postoperative confusion may interfere with the management of the original surgical problem and it occurs in a setting where interest and expertise in its management are low. There is scope for improved recognition, treatment and prevention of postoperative confusion. More work needs to be done to evaluate the effect of surgery and anaesthesia on mental function, especially in the very elderly.",

      "title": "Caregiving Experiences of Families Living with Patients with Schizophrenia: a Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of the review is to determine the meaningfulness of caregiving experiences of families living with patients with schizophrenia. The specific review question is: - What are the experiences of caregivers who live with patients with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and chronic mental illnesses characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking and of emotional responsiveness.1 It most commonly manifests as hallucinations, paranoid, bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking as well as significant social or occupational dysfunction.2, 3 Schizophrenia affects about 24 million people worldwide.2 It is among the top 10 causes of disability-adjusted life year globally.4 Likewise, impairments of cognition, language, motor development, and social behaviour impact to patients' lifestyle, sense of well being and satisfaction reflecting to their QoL (quality of life).5 Thus, the patients with schizophrenia require help and care from others.6 In addition, in many countries, current mental health care policy focuses on encouraging patients with schizophrenia or mental illness to return to the community to live with their family. Consequently, the families of patients with schizophrenia are often required to play the major role of taking responsibility for caring these patients.7 Care activities for patients with schizophrenia are difficult, often long-term responsibilities of the families. Hence, the families are confronted with a challenging situation8 in order to balance between providing good care for their relative with schizophrenia, others members in their family as well as themselves. In this way, families have many tasks such as ensuring that the patients take prescribed medications, get sufficient food and sleep, conducting other daily living activities, as well as preventing them from potentially dangerous behaviour.9 The families are also confronted with additional problems including financial problems and worry about the general health and recurrence of illness of the patients in addition to management of the patient's behaviour.9,10 Meanwhile, the families have to take other roles in their life and family, including financial, employment, social life, physical health, marital and family relationships, and daily household activities. Families' lives may be disrupted by providing more care activities than would normally be anticipated.9 As stated, care activities for patients with schizophrenia may have a significant impact on all aspects of individual lives as well as the entire family system and this may have a dysfunctional impact on the family.9,10,11,12 The difficulties experienced by the families of patients with schizophrenia can be categorized into objective and subjective problems. The objective problems refer to practical problems such as disruptions in family functioning and relationships, constraints in social, work and leisure activities, general health disturbances, and financial problems. The subjective problems refer to the psychological reactions of the families such as stress, burden, feeling of shame, loss, guilt, anger, depression, anxiety, embarrassment in social situation, and stigma.13 Both objective and subjective problems impact on health and functioning of the families of patients with schizophrenia. These are associated with reduced quality of life.14 However, overcoming difficulties in care-giving can provide a sense of inner strength and satisfaction as major life challenges to the families of patients with schizophrenia.15 Thus, there are also some positive experiences of living with schizophrenia patients such as feelings of worth and achievement, a closer relationship with the patient10, fulfillment of parental duties and self-knowledge.16 These positive experiences can assist families to accept their caring role.10 Therefore, experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia reflect special issues and problems within the family that impact on their own quality of life as well as the quality of care. Families express a need for both physical and emotional support in order to care and cope effectively with patients with schizophrenia.8,10,17 It appears essential to raise awareness of the plight of families of patients with schizophrenia so that they are able to receive suitable support according to their different service needs. It is important and necessary for health care providers or mental health professionals such as nurses to know and understand the experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes, needs, coping and overcoming obstacles. This information and knowledge will help health care providers or mental health professionals to develop appropriate interventions that aim to help solve problems and serve the needs of the family of patients with schizophrenia.18 Caregiving experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia can be studied in a holistic and meaningful manner by using qualitative approaches. For example, a study of families from a metropolitan area in a south eastern state in the USA explored the experiences of 26 families who were living with a patient with schizophrenia.19 Those families volunteered to complete the questionnaire known as the descriptive from of the instrument which measures the psychosocial variables including family coping behaviours, family psychological distress, family social support, and patient behavioural problems that influence on family functioning in families providing care for a family member with schizophrenia. Through the written descriptive data, the reactions, experiences, and perceptions of those families yielded the value issues of caregiving experiences of families living with schizophrenia. Researchers independently generated lists of categories of those written answers. Themes were identified and agreed upon through an interpretive lens. In addition, the findings were sent to the participants to confirm the findings. The results showed the feelings, issues, and concerns of providing care for a family member with schizophrenia as five themes: 1) overwhelming feelings, 2) importance of medication, 3) legal system difficulties, 4) family and friends, and 5) mental health professionals.19 Another study explored the caring experiences of 10 carers who are family members lived with someone with long-term schizophrenia, within the cultural context of Taiwan.10 The carers were interviewed face-to-face followed the semi-structured interview guide. They were encouraged to express or share their feelings and perceptions about their caring experience. Then, field notes and transcripts from tape recorders were analysed through phenomenological approach. The results showed three themes including 1) burdens of caring, 2) emotional burdens, and 3) strategies of coping.10 Furthermore, there are other qualitative studies which focus on caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia that indicated the similar results such as tasks or care activities that families must do, negative or sometime positive feeling toward patients, burden20,21,22,23,24 coping or ways that families used to manage the difficult situation25, needs of families as well as help seeking behaviours24 for support them. However, there appears to be a deficit of systematic reviews on the caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia. There was only one systematic review on the needs of family caregivers of a person with depression that indicates the caregivers are not prepared for the impact of the illness and that they need information about the development of depression, training in communication skills, and understanding on the importance of antidepressants in controlling the disease.26 There is no previously conducted systematic review on to determine the meaningfulness of caregiving experiences of families living with patients with schizophrenia. This systematic review, therefore, aims to synthesis research findings concerning the subjective caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia. It will help health care providers or mental health professionals to know and understand the experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. The outcomes of the review may serve as basis information for public health guidelines or frameworks which aim to promote quality of life and quality of care for the family of patients with schizophrenia. The overall aim is to increase quality of life of patients with schizophrenia. The Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Library database and CINAHL database have been searched and no previous systematic reviews on this specific topic were identified as published or underway. Inclusion criteria Types of participants The review will consider studies that include the family of person (18 years and older) with schizophrenia diagnosed for at least six months by any criteria based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Third Edition Revised (DSM-III-R), the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition Text Revision (DSM-IV TR), the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), or confirmed by their attending psychiatrists. Non-schizophrenic patients such as patients with psychosis, depression, bipolar, dementia, alcoholism, and substance-related disorders will be excluded. The family is defined as key persons who live or who are in close contact with the patient or who provide care or have taken on role as the main caregivers for a family member with schizophrenia. The caregivers should be at least 18 years old who can be parents, siblings, spouses, children, or other relatives. This review will consider studies in any culture. Studies that explore experiences of patients with schizophrenia will be excluded. Caregiving experiences are defined as any subjective data that families expressed or shared about their feelings and perceptions related to their caring or living with their schizophrenia member including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes or beliefs, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest The review will consider qualitative studies that explore caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia that related to their caring or living with their schizophrenia member including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes or beliefs, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. This review will include studies conducted in either hospital or community settings. Types of outcomes The outcomes of interest include but are not restricted to the following 1. Subjective accounts of families of patients with schizophrenia related to caregiving. 2. Attitudes, beliefs, or feelings of families toward living or caring a patient with schizophrenia. 3. Families' perceived caring tasks, responses, or actions to patients with schizophrenia. 4. Perceived needs of families of patients with schizophrenia. 5. Coping, help seeking behaviors, ways to solve problems of families of patients with schizophrenia. Types of studies The review will consider any qualitative studies that draw on caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia, using research methodologies including, but not limited to phenomenology, grounded theory and ethnography. Search strategy Prior to commencing the review, a search of databases, Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute library of systematic reviews will be conducted to ensure that there is no systematic review conducted on lived experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia. A comprehensive search strategy will be developed to find both published and unpublished studies in English and Thai languages from 1990-2010. A three step search strategy will be used in this review as follow: 1. An initial limited search of journals indexed in MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title, abstracts, and subject descriptors / MeSH terms of relevant articles used to identify additional key words. In this review, initial English keywords to be used will be: lived experiences or experiences, meanings, attitudes, beliefs, feelings, views, tasks, caring tasks, caring activities, roles, responses, actions, family or families, relatives, caregivers, careers, parents or father or mother, spouse or wife or husband, siblings, son, daughter, child or children, schizophrenia, qualitative. In addition, initial Thai keywords to be used will be: krobkrua = family, phudola = caregiver, yat = relatives, prasobkan = experience, tatsanakati or jettakati = attitudes, kwamchua = belief, botbat = role or task, jittaphet = schizophrenia, wijuy cheang kunnaphab = qualitative research 2. All identified key words and the synonyms will be used for the extensive search by respective electronic databases. Individual search strategies will be developed for each database, adopting the different terminology of index thesauri if available. The databases to be searched include: -CINAHL -EMBASE -Cochrane Library -PubMed - Science Direct -Scopus -PsycINFO -ProQuest -www.thairesearch.in.th and tdc.thailis.or.th/tdc (database for Thai study languages) 3. Reference lists and bibliographies of retrieved articles will also be searched for additional relevant articles. In order to avoid publication bias, hand searching will also be undertaken in journals which are not listed on databases but are known to contain literature in this topic of investigation to ensure all relevant materials are captured. The relevant unpublished studies such as conference papers, research reports, and dissertations will be searched by the following sources: -MEDNAR -Dissertation International -Conference Proceedings In addition, content experts will also be contacted in order to provide other alternatives for securing relevant literature. All studies identified during the database search will be assessed for relevance to the review objectives and full reports will be retrieved for all studies that meet the inclusion criteria as assessed independently by two reviewers. Discrepancies in reviewer selections will be resolved by discussion prior to selected articles being retrieved. Those studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be subjected to critical appraisal using a standardised Joanna Briggs Critical appraisal instrument. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised a critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Data will be extracted from papers included in the review using the standardised data extraction tool from the JBI-QARI (Appendix II). The data extracted will include specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Research findings will, where possible be pooled using the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). This will involve the aggregation or synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation, through assembling the findings (Level 1 findings) rates according to their quality, and categorising these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning (Level 2 findings). These categories are then subjected to a metasynthesis in order to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesised findings (Level 3 findings) that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Where textual pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. Conflicts of interest There is no conflict of interest regarding this systematic review.

They are often perceived as benign, devoid of side effects and a safer option compared to allopathic medication. However, these treatments have active ingredients which can have potential effects and side effects like any other psychoactive substance or medication. Due to the lack of controlled studies, evidence about the incidence of side effects related to herbal products is limited. This case report describes a single experience of long-term use of ashwagandha followed by significant symptoms of anxiety and depression on withdrawal and the emergence of a psychotic episode six months later.

Being a process rather than a goal, recovery involves taking into account patients' preferences in terms of values and life goals. Data showing that religion and spirituality can be an important part of recovery have begun to appear in the literature. Indeed, religious coping appears to be important for patients with schizophrenia, not only as a way of coping with their disorder and other life issues, but also in terms of one's identity and setting important life goals. By contrast, the deleterious influence of religion on positive symptoms may have been overestimated, as there is no evidence supporting this hypothesis. Even if a minority of patients experiences delusions with religious content, this does not appear to constitute, a fortiori, a negative issue, as qualitative research shows that this does not hinder patients from gaining some help from religion or spirituality.

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a common feature of men with multiple sclerosis. SD is often unrecognized as patients and physicians are reluctant to discuss these problems. Rates of symptoms range from 50% to 90% and include erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction and reduced libido. SD can arise at any stage of the disease, even without severe disability. While erectile dysfunction is thought to be related to impairment of the pathways in the spinal cord, fatigue, spasticity, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pain, contribute to SD. Psychosocial and cultural issues also need evaluating, and include depression, performance anxiety, lowered self-esteem. A comprehensive assessment of all theses aspects must be taken into account. Erectile dysfunction can be treated with phosphodiesterase inhibitors and intracavernous injections, with good efficacy. Ejaculatory dysfunction is managed through penile vibratory stimulation and midodrine. Concerning fertility issues, the effects of or immunomodulating drugs on semen quality are largely unknown, whereas many immunosuppressive therapies have a negative effect on semen quality that may be definitive. Advanced methods of assisted reproduction may sometimes be the only option for conception. Physicians' awareness of this problem may help to bring about appropriate treatments, and improve the quality of life for these patients.",

B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "abstract": "The development of psychotropic chemotherapy with widespread use in the psychiatric clinic for its anxiolytic, hypnotic, antidepressant, psychostimulant or psycho-destructive sedative effects has given rise to a new pathology secondary to increased abuse and accessibility. Their neurotropism is generally exerted on the central nervous system at the level of the complex meso-diencephalo-striate structures, influencing the elementary psychic functions, but also the activity of the whole organism through the neuro-humoral system. The clinical investigation of the patient must be interdisciplinary in nature, as human beings are characterized by a bio-psycho-social unit, in which the various biological and psychological components, influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social environment, are involved in a special way, which gives an original personality to everyone. There are five fundamental axes, which are usually evaluated: thinking, memory, attention, emotion and behavior. A disorder in any of these axes, intense enough to interrupt the normal activity in more than one operating field over a sufficiently long period of time, is diagnosable as a mental disorder. There is an indication borrowed from internal medicine regarding the acute character (weeks), subacute character (months) and chronic character (years), which is attached to the diagnosis. A small part of the entire psychiatric population suffers from severe conditions, which involve intermittent episodes of severe disinhibition, aggressive behavior and self- or hetero-directed violence. In most cases, we talk about conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), which do not make him a social predator, although they cause enormous suffering to the individual. This study includes 67 patients with mental illness. While conducting the study, we took into account that the first contact with the patient is essential for the results of the anamnesis, oral examination, risk assessment and provisional treatment plan. In the 67 cases there were performed mycological analyses. It is necessary that dentists have certain knowledge of psychology and psychopathology, in order to understand the mechanism of psychopathological reactions and avoid them.",

      "title": "The Impact of Mental Illness on Sexual Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is prevalent among psychiatric patients and may be related to both the psychopathology and the pharmacotherapy. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia limit the capability for interpersonal and sexual relationships. The first-generation antipsychotics cause further deterioration in erectile and orgasmic function. Due to their weak antagonistic activity at D2 receptors, second-generation antipsychotics are associated with fewer sexual side effects, and thus may provide an option for schizophrenia patients with sexual dysfunction. Depression and anxiety are a cause for sexual dysfunction that may be aggravated by antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction may be overcome by lowering doses, switching to an antidepressant with low propensity to cause sexual dysfunction (bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, reboxetine), addition of 5HT2 antagonists (mirtazapine, mianserin) or coadministration of 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Eating disorders and personality disorders, mainly borderline personality disorder, are also associated with sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction in these cases stems from impaired interpersonal relationships and may respond to adequate psychosexual therapy. It is mandatory to identify the specific sexual dysfunction and to treat the patients according to his/her individual psychopathology, current pharmacotherapy and interpersonal relationships.",

The symptoms are frequently recurrent, but are not usually associated with disability. Spells are frequently forgotten, and medical attention is not generally sought. Although the possibility of serious spinal pathology must be considered, the majority of adolescent back trouble may be considered a normal life experience. The efficacy of treatment for non-specific back pain in this age group is undetermined, but the similarities with adult symptoms suggests that management should follow current clinical guidelines for adults (early activation and advice stressing the benign nature of the problem). Persisting root pain may best respond to chemonucleolysis. There is no evidence that treatment or lifestyle changes at this age will reduce symptoms in adult life, but inappropriate medical attention may have detrimental psychosocial consequences.",

Visoka prevalencija (5-8 %) govori u prilog tome da u svakom razredu ili vrtićkoj grupi možemo očekivati jedno dete/učenika za ovim problemom. Danas, za dijagnostikovanje ovog poremećaja koristimo DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) klasifikaciju (četiri kriterijuma). Prema ovom statističkom priručniku RPK se dijagnostikuje ako je izvođenje motoričkih veština ispod hronološkog uzrasta, ako ometa svakodnevne aktivnosti, ako je početak u razvojnom periodu i ako se motorički deficit ne može objasniti nekim drugim oštećenjem (npr. cerebralnom paralizom). Etilogija RPK je multifaktorska. Najviše problema učenici sa RPK pokazuju na nastavi fizičkog vaspitanja, srpskog jezika i matematike.

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

      "title": "Impaired Driving From Medical Conditions",
      "abstract": "Some medical disorders can impair performance, increasing the risk of driving safety errors that can lead to vehicle crashes. The causal pathway often involves a concatenation of factors or events, some of which can be prevented or controlled. Effective interventions can operate before, during, or after a crash occurs at the levels of driver capacity, vehicle and road design, and public policy. A variety of systemic, neurological, psychiatric, and developmental disorders put drivers at potential increased risk of a car crash in the short or long term. Medical diagnosis and age alone are usually insufficient criteria for determining fitness to drive. Strategies are needed for determining what types and levels of reduced function provide a threshold for disqualification in drivers with medical disorders. Evidence of decreased mileage, self-restriction to driving in certain situations, collisions, moving violations, aggressive driving, sleepiness, alcohol abuse, metabolic disorders, and multiple medications may trigger considerations of driver safety. A general framework for evaluating driver fitness relies on a functional evaluation of multiple domains (cognitive, motor, perceptual, and psychiatric) that are important for safe driving and can be applied across many disorders, including conditions that have rarely been studied with respect to driving, and in patients with multiple conditions and medications. Neurocognitive tests, driving simulation, and road tests provide complementary sources of evidence to evaluate driver safety. No single test is sufficient to determine who should drive and who should not.",

Most people experience some small or large difficulties or problems at one time or another during the course of their life. The chapter offers a selection of commonly used mental health terms that can be useful to know. Mental disorders are classified into diagnostic categories that are defined in terms of patterns of signs and symptoms, the course the disorder takes and its 'usual' outcome. The chapter illustrates the basic contents of the human mental state. It also illustrates the content of the mental state examination (MSE).

Depressions in old age are commonly associated with medical conditions; prevalence rates of depression in cases of stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and disabilities (all much commoner in old age) range upward from about 20%. Depressions are attributed to both psychological and biological reactions. Mania, too, can be precipitated by cerebral and other medical factors. The proportion of psychiatric inpatients who have depressions with melancholic and/or psychotic features is higher among elderly subjects, and this has been linked with white matter lesions and other brain changes that become commoner in old age.

Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "abstract": "This paper does not attempt to review the whole topic of clinical efficacy but will consider general concepts, particularly in the light of the advent of the serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The aetiology of depression is complex. In most cases there is some form of predisposition based on problematical family dynamics, disordered family communication and/or genetic factors; each may be present to a variable extent. On top of this predisposition, some form of stimulus - ‘stress’, an external problem, loss of control, a physical disorder, adverse life circumstances - appears to affect those who are already primed. There are a variety of possible outcomes from this combination of predisposition and stimuli: low mood, depression in the full syndromic sense, and depression with biological features. It seems likely that, particularly with severe depressions (the major syndromic forms and those with biological features), there are neuroendocrine and neurochemical changes to mediate the effects of stress into those of the clinical symptoms and signs. It has been hypothesised that stressors induce adaptive neurochemical changes, failure of which may engender behavioural disturbances (Anisman &amp; Zacharko, 1992). However, there are also many individuals who may not undergo this process, but who probably have some cognitive or learned change leading to dysphoria; this aspect needs to be considered carefully in relation to efficacy.",

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones.

Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

In care for older adults experiencing mental health–substance use problems, which also experience age-related illness and infirmity, there may be multiple caregivers involved. Comorbidities are more common in older adults, and caregivers must be cognisant of drug-drug interactions and further potential adverse effects. As many older adults face the serious illnesses, as well as various social and economic difficulties, health and social care professionals may mistakenly conclude that depression is a normal consequence of these problems, an attitude often shared by the person. An older adult experiencing mental health–substance use problems can remain in the community while their substance use and mental health problems are active. Mental health–substance use problems are not a sufficient diagnosis to warrant admission to long-term care.

      "abstract": "Abstract Capacity assessments are performed when there is suspicion that a person is unable to adequately care for their physical, medical, or financial well‐being. The purpose of these assessments is to inform the legal system as to whether or not guardianship may be necessary. It is well established that certain mental illnesses, such as neurocognitive disorders (dementia) or psychotic disorders (like schizophrenia), may diminish capacity and, in some cases, lead to the need for establishment of a legal guardian. However, personality disorders are another common category of mental illness which may impair decision‐making. There is very little information in the literature about how or why these disorders could impair capacity, and thus, it can often be difficult to discern whether clients with personality disorders are substantially unable to care for themselves—versus unwilling to act in a way contrary to their ingrained habits. We present a series of three cases in which clients are determined to lack capacity primarily mediated by a personality disorder diagnosis. They are demonstrated to have mild deficits in cognitive functioning, but they show impaired decision‐making out of proportion to these deficits. In all three cases, it is apparent that the personality disorder is substantially impairing their ability to care for themselves. Discussion includes consideration for ways to incorporate evaluations of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and personality considerations into capacity assessments, and how to approach recommendations (such as guardianship vs. less restrictive option) based on both level and scope of impairment.",

Some of these symptoms, hypersomnolence, compulsive eating and increased sexual drive may be replaced by their opposites or alternate with them. Remarkably enough, these « atypical symptoms » have never been enlighted nor compared in frequency with corresponding typical symptoms. Besides, KLS is more frequent in males than in females but no review has ever compared the frequency of precipitating factors and symptoms in males and females.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Due to the significant strategic importance of the marine transport system, the issue of ensuring various types of security (especially medical, psychological) for personnel working in this branch of the national economy seems relevant. The Marine Doctrine of the Russian Federation and the corresponding Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 512 dated July 31, 2022 is the leading document regulating these issues. The article presents various groups of factors that affect the health of seafarers (genetic, medical support, living conditions and lifestyle, the state of the environment). The negative aspects of these factors that impair the health of the crew are listed: disorders of adaptive processes in the body, up to stressful conditions; the occurrence of diseases of the body systems (cardiovascular, endocrine, nervous, sensory, musculoskeletal system); the purchasing of various kinds of dependent states (alcohol and nicotine); decreased physical activity, eating habits, satisfaction from their work, psychological and emotional stress disorders social isolation, fatigue. The problem of the shortage of specialists in the marine medicine, despite the requirements of word standards, is emphasized. In this regard, the problem is raised about the training of specialized medical personnel (including in the field of psychological support) in medical educational organizations for prevention, sanitary, educational and hygienic work with personnel, monitoring the health of seafarers, timely identification of premorbid conditions, quality treatment and rehabilitation. To solve it, first of all, an integrated approach at the state level is needed. First of all, it is proposed to improve the legislative basis, and then the implementation of documents at all levels of administrative authority.",

There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive; predominantly hyperactive-impulsive; and combined type. For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. At the age of 25, half will still have symptoms which continue to cause significant impairment. ADHD is associated with an increased rate of other disorders: mood disorders; anxiety; other behavioural disorders; autism spectrum disorders; tic disorders; specific learning difficulties; developmental co-ordination disorder and sleep disorders. The GP has an important role in identification of possible ADHD, and onward referral, and also in the management of ADHD post-diagnosis, particularly with respect to prescribing medication usually on a shared care basis with specialist services.",

It exacerbates somatic symptoms of menopause, increasing the risk of recurrence of mood disorders, as well as of a mood disorder de novo throughout the lifespan and specifically in the menopausal transition. Chronic stress affects the hypothalamic–pituitary axis, hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis, the proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk. The current evidence for the potential interactions between acute stress, chronic stress, childhood stress and victimization, and individual susceptibility to the development of depression and/or anxiety in response to stressful life events, are reviewed in the context of the increasing data on the association of these and a symptomatic menopausal transition. Strategies for the optimal approach for clinicians to evaluate and treat the symptomatic perimenopausal patient with stressful life events and comorbid mood disorders are presented.",

Alcoholism produces pathophysiological effects where alcohol is concentrated in the blood which is related to the central nervous system causing depressive disorders where the human can lead to a coma.

Symptoms of withdrawal include autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor in the hands, insomnia, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations.

This can be especially true for mental health conditions that may greatly impact the presentation of a patient in the healthcare setting with urologic symptoms. This review describes the history, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, compulsive sexual behavior/hypersexuality, factitious disorder, malingering symptoms, and conversion disorder in the realm of urology. Given the newly updated psychiatric diagnoses in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, there has been a lack of studies reviewing how these illnesses may present in a urology patient encounter. Additionally, as these mental health illnesses may carry a rare incidence compared to other well-known mental health illness such as generalized depression or generalized anxiety disorder, we have found that the lack of provisions and recognition of the diseases can prolong the timeline for diagnosis and lead to an increased cost in both healthcare and quality of life of patients with these mental health illnesses. This review provides awareness on these mental health conditions which may greatly impact patient history and presentation within the field of urology. Additionally, urologic care providers may have an improved understanding of interdisciplinary management of such illnesses and the common symptoms patients may present with such diseases.",

Depression worsens course and prognosis of comorbid somatic disorders. A major consequence is the high suicide rate in the elderly. Depression is also a risk factor for other disorders like dementia or institutionalisation. The interplay between depression and dementia and other organic brain disorders is complex und still unresolved. Depression in the elderly is a challenge for our health system. Recognition and treatment rates are still too low. Integrative treatment plans for depression with comorbid physical disorders or in various settings should be developed.

The ability to cope in everyday life is affected by the reduction of physical fitness, sensory impairment and the effects of chronic conditions, falls and injuries. Deterioration of physical fitness is a consequence of muscle mass and strength reduction, impaired neuromuscular function resulted in slowing nerve conduction and reaction time, deterioration of balance, coordination and central transmission. Vision and hearing disorders are a consequence of aging and diseases. Cognition impairment, important for an independence, may be a consequence of degenerative changes in the CNS or dementia. Numerous studies have confirmed the relationship of involutional changes, accompanying diseases, falls and injures with limitations in daily functioning, and maintaining physical activity and implementation of a comprehensive geriatric assessment into geriatric care with an early diagnosis of deficits and implementation of intervention can prevent or delay the disclosure of disability.",

      "abstract": "Functional constipation (FC) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder in children, characterized by infrequent, difficult, or painful bowel movements without an identifiable organic cause. This review provides an overview of functional constipation in children, discussing its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and management strategies. FC affects approximately 5-30% of children, with risk factors including dietary habits, psychosocial stressors, and family history. The pathophysiology involves colonic hypomotility, rectal hyposensitivity, and behavioral factors, often compounded by pelvic floor dysfunction. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on Rome IV criteria, with further testing considered in atypical cases. Management includes dietary modifications, behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy, and, in some cases, biofeedback therapy. Long-term outcomes are generally favorable with appropriate treatment, although relapse is common, emphasizing the need for sustained management. Functional constipation significantly impacts a child's quality of life, affecting both physical and emotional well-being. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for effective treatment, addressing both physiological and psychological aspects to optimize long-term health outcomes for children with FC.",

      "abstract": "Menopause is associated with several symptoms which, if they reach certain intensity, can severely impair the quality of life. Overall, 90.9% of Latin American women will have at least one climacteric symptom and in 25%, these will be severe. Musculoskeletal pain, physical and mental fatigue and depressed mood are the most common climacteric symptoms. Dyspareunia, mood disorders and irritability can significantly alter female sexuality. Hot flashes are the symptoms most frequently related to menopause by both physicians and patients. However, it is one of the less common menopausal symptoms. This symptom reflects the neurochemical brain disorders caused by estrogen deficiency. The central nervous system (CNS) is also involved in changes of body composition leading to higher adipose tissue accumulation during climacterium, deteriorating quality of life and increasing the risk for chronic non-transmittable diseases. Menopausal discomfort also overloads health systems increasing the demand for medical services and decreasing productivity by labor absenteeism. Hormone therapy of menopause (HTM) decreases menopausal symptoms and improves quality of life. If we do not prescribe HTM to those women who need it, we could deprive them from several potential health benefits.",

The majority of patients suffer long-standing anxiety symptoms which do not significantly interfere with working performance or social relationships. Another ten percent of the patients are continuously impaired in everyday living by severe symptoms. Long duration and severe degree of symptoms at the initial assessment, as well as coexistent depression are associated with a poor outcome. There is evidence of an increased mortality in patients with panic disorder. Suicides are overrepresented among the causes of death.

It is suggested that the primary care physician or specialist (urologist or neurologist) screen for this problematic style when presented with male sexual dysfunction. Further, and more controversially, it is suggested that a primary prevention model would argue for masturbatory instruction in the home, classroom, orpediatric clinical setting.",

      "abstract": "Hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome resulting from failure to produce physiological concentrations of sex steroid hormones with accompanying symptoms, such as slowed growth and delayed pubertal maturation. Hypogonadism may arise from gonadal disease (primary hypogonadism), dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis (secondary hypogonadism) or functional hypogonadism. Disrupted puberty (delayed or absent) leading to hypogonadism can have a significant impact on both the physical and psychosocial well-being of adolescents with lasting effects. The diagnosis of hypogonadism in teenagers can be challenging as the most common cause of delayed puberty in both sexes is self-limited, also known as constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP). Although an underlying congenital cause should always be considered in a teenager with hypogonadism, acquired conditions such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, other chronic diseases and medications have all been associated with low sex steroid hormone levels. In this review, we highlight some forms of functional hypogonadism in adolescents and the clinical challenges to differentiate normal variants from pathological states.",

Contrary evidence, however, suggests that dysphoric mania may be a form of typical mania, a stage-related or severe form of mania, or a transitional state between mania and depression. Because the evidence may be inconsistent because of varying definitions of dysphoric mania among studies, the authors propose preliminary operational diagnostic criteria for the future study of dysphoric mania.",

This review explores the biological and psychological aspects of desire, as well as the aetiology and therapeutic options for loss of desire. Recent findings Discoveries have been made in terms of the physiology of desire in men, in that it is affected by estradiol as well as testosterone. It has also been shown that desire is less gender specific in androphilic women than in androphilic men and gynaephilic men and women. Fatigue has been described as the most common self-reported cause of loss of desire, with communication as the most common method for addressing this. In men, a clear distinction has been shown between disorders of arousal and disorders of desire, suggesting that they should remain as separate conditions in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. Loss of desire has been proven to be a significant consequence of diabetes, multiple sclerosis and polycystic ovary syndrome and can occur as a side-effect of statins and 5α-reductase inhibitors. Testosterone therapy may be an effective treatment for loss of desire in both men and women, and is safe in the treatment of men who have been treated for prostate cancer. It also has a significant impact on desire when used in the treatment of individuals with gender dysphoria. Nonhormonal treatments including flibanserin and new methods of therapy may also be effective. Summary Loss of desire is underrecognized as a symptom of disease or as a complaint in its own right. As further developments in treatment options, both therapies based and pharmacological, are made, it is increasingly important that clinicians enquire about sexual dysfunction, including loss of desire, at every consultation.",

Es kommt dabei häufig zu einem Verfall der sozialen, beruflichen, materiellen und familiären Werte und Verpflichtungen. Dies kann auch illegale Handlungen umfassen. Wurde exzessives Glücksspielen im DSM-IV noch als Impulskontrollstörung klassifiziert, erfolgte im DSM-5 eine Neueinordnung unter den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen. Relevant hierfür waren Parallelen zu Substanzabhängigkeiten hinsichtlich der klinischen Charakteristika sowie auch genetischer und neurobiologischer Faktoren. In Deutschland geht man in der erwachsenen Gesamtbevölkerung von bis zu 0,5 % Betroffenen aus. Das Risiko für spielbezogene Probleme ist dabei besonders hoch bei Nutzern von Glücks- und Geldspielautomaten. Häufige Komorbiditäten sind substanzbezogene Störungen und affektive Erkrankungen. Zu den wichtigsten Risikofaktoren zählen junges Alter, männliches Geschlecht, Migrationshintergrund, Familienangehörige mit Glücksspielproblemen, Arbeitslosigkeit, niedriger Bildungsabschluss und geringes Haushaltsnettoeinkommen. Delinquenz erwies sich jedoch als kein ausreichend diskriminatives Merkmal für die Erkrankung, wenngleich sich ein korrelativer Zusammenhang zwischen Delinquenz und problematischem Spielverhalten zeigt. Auch findet sich bei Betroffenen, die delinquentes Verhalten zeigen, ein besonderes Risikoprofil. Entsprechend sind mögliche psychosoziale Folgen wie Delinquenz auch im Rahmen der zur Verfügung stehenden, effektiven Behandlungsstrategien, wie der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie, therapeutisch zu berücksichtigen. Zudem sind die Zugangswege von Betroffenen ins Hilfesystem dringend auszubauen, um die frühzeitige Versorgung zu gewährleisten.",

After seven psychiatric hospitalizations, it does not present a definitive diagnosis, poor prognosis and multiple relapses. Objectives Both analyze clinical, psychopathological and epidemiological characteristics of behavioral disorders in relation to a clinical case and review causes, incidence, prevalence, diagnostic, therapeutic tools and the importance of an appropriate differential diagnosis to reach a correct therapeutic approach. Methods Review of the impact literature for the last five years concerning behavioral disorders: prevalence, incidence, pathogenesis and its relationship with psychiatric disorders encoded in DSM-V. Results It is evident that the patient has behavioral disorders and psychotic symptoms in the context of cocaine intoxication. Although sometimes the dose of cocaine has been very small and probably not justifies in all cases a toxic psychosis, it is true that withdrawal periods have been short; therefore difficult to assess. Also mania-like symptoms have been discussed because the patient has an increased activity, dysphoric mood, anxiety and decreased need for sleep. Conclusions Response to treatment and hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention characteristics make us consider the diagnosis of adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD in adults and adolescents have significant comorbidity with substance abuse, particularly cocaine, amphetamines and psychostimulants, also alcohol, tobacco and cannabis, and with other psychiatric disorders: oppositional defiant, personality (especially cluster B: antisocial, etc), anxiety (generalized anxiety, phobias, panic..), affective or eating disorders.

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DDD) is a common mental disorder, but it is rarely diagnosed and adequately treated. Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

This presentation deals with extraordinary side effects: side effects due to drug interaction, nutrition, age, enzyme abnormality, ecologic disturbance, drug resistance, social problems, and inferior therapy. The best way to limit the side effect of drugs is by basic understanding of drug action obtainable only by well‐controlled, well‐designed experiments in man. Otherwise, drugs will be used without this vital information until, in clinical use by trial‐and‐error method, sufficient data are haphazardly collected to provide conclusive evidence of drug effects. This is the common medical experiment in man, a mass experiment of a retrospective type in which the patient plays the role of the unwitting subject and the phYSician is the unwitting observer. It is inefficient, exposes more patients to poorly understood drugs than necessary, and, until the necessary information is obtained, is marked by avoidable catastrophe.",

      "abstract": "As shown in this review, insomnia is very common and often constitutes a chronic health problem excused by diverse medical, psychiatric and psychosocial conditions as well as substance abuse. Approximately 10% of the general population and 20% of primary care attendees suffer from severe insomnia. Clinical hallmarks of sleeplessness are the patients' complaints about insufficient and non-restorative sleep, severe daytime consequences without any tendency to fall asleep and presence of symptoms on three days per week for more than one month. Insomniacs tend to suffer from psycho-physiologic hyperarousal that prevents physical and mental relaxation. They are more susceptible to stress and seem to have a high sympathetic drive. Insomnia therefore has been compared to chronic caffeine intoxication. It must he pointed out that insomnia is probably more a qualitative rather than a quantitative disorder of sleep. Neither doctors nor patients routinely talk about disturbed sleep during consultations which might he one reason why insomnia very often goes undiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should routinely inquire afoul their patients' sleep and sleeping habits and take, if appropriate, a full sleep history on the basis of which further investigational and therapeutic steps can be planned: well-established tools of proved efficacy are available to treat both primary and secondary insomnia. Acute or transient insomnia lasting less than four weeks can he treated with hypnotics. Chronic insomnia is the domain of nonpharmacological psychotherapy, which can be conducted in a single or group setting.",

Sexually inappropriate behaviors are not as common as other behaviors seen in dementia but may be seen in 7-30% subjects. These behaviors cause a lot of distress to all those who are affected along with shame and embarrassment. Sexual behaviors in dementia lie on a spectrum that may range from mild or benign to severe. There are no rigorous clinical studies for the treatment of these behaviors and there is no fixed classification for the types of behavior either. There is sparse data that suggest efficacy for some commonly used treatment modalities in dementia. In this chapter, we review the various aspects of these behaviors, their types and the available treatment for the same.

Factitious disorder and malingering are the only two disorders in the DSM ‐5 that require the intentional production of symptoms; the two are distinguished on the basis of underlying incentive. Factitious disorder is difficult to study, as patients that clearly have this diagnosis rarely consent to research. Case reports indicate that the disorder is most common in young women in the health‐care profession, although the most chronic and severe form (Munchausen syndrome) occurs primarily in men. Etiology of the disorder is unknown, although many patients with this diagnosis had a serious childhood illness. Treatment can be difficult, as patients with a feigned physical disorder rarely believe they are psychologically disordered.",

The paralysis appears to be due to pressure upon the nerve before it divides into the anterior and posterior branches, as manifested by paralysis of the entire motor distribution.

No permanent disability was observed. The duration of the paralysis may be from a few hours to several months.\n\n6. Mild transient types of cases most certainly occur, their presence being overlooked or considered a post-delivery incidence rather than a complication of labor.\n\n7. Cases may be divided into pseudo partial and pseudo total, depending upon the point of pressure.\n\n8. Primary separation of the symphysis articulation occurs, permitting the head to occupy a position low in the pelvis.\n\n9. The severe pain in the symphysis pubis is due to two things: first—early separation of the symphysis articulation, resulting in an inflammatory lesion of the normal synovia; second—irritation of the sensory portion of the genito crural nerve from pressure.",

With respect to the emotional factors involved in the side effects of OCs on the basis of a study of a sample of 70 young and healthy women it is concluded that some side effects of OCs appear to be psychosomatic and actually due to the fear and anticipation of side effects on the part of the patients. It was also found that women suffering from emotional maladjustment tended to complain of more and more serious side effects. Some side effects appear to be due to biological causes (e.g. weight gain enlargment of the breast) others to psychological causes (depression irritability decreased interest in sexual relations) while others (e.g. fatigue and nausea) may be caused by factors of either type.",

Moreover, usual screening tests and diagnostic questionnaires are often not suited for the aged. Psychopathology of addictions in the aged points out vulnerabilities not resolved with the advance in age, in connection with separation, narcissism, oral regression, alexithymia and other pathological dimensions of personality. The weight of the environment, dominated by a certain agism, remains a brake to the global care that must be based, as in younger adults, on motivational approach and specific treatments with special pharmacological vigilance.",

      "abstract": "Mrs. C, age 48, has depression and extreme anxiety. She has tried several antidepressants, but discontinued them because of side effects. What could be causing her medication intolerance? CASE Medication sensitivity Mrs. C, age 48, is admitted to a tertiary care inpatient mood disorder unit for evaluation of severe depression characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, and insomnia. Her initial Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17-Item (HRSD-17) score is 30, indicating severe depression. Her medications are fluoxetine, 10 mg/d, and diazepam, 0.5 mg/d. Mrs. C describes a 10-month history of depression and extreme anxiety in the context of several psychosocial stressors. Her father recently died and she is having difficulty with the demands of administering her father's estate. She is intensely obsessive and focused on nihilistic themes, her diagnosis, somatic themes, and medications side effects. Her husband confirms our observations. No history or current symptoms of typical compulsions (eg, washing hands or checking doors) are elicited. She has limited insight into her obsessive tendencies. Mrs. C had no psychiatric history before her depressive and obsessive symptoms developed 10 months ago. However, in the past 10 months, she has been hospitalized in a psychiatric facility twice. She also received a series of 8 electroconvulsive therapy treatments, but reported minimal improvement of her depressive symptoms. Mrs. C had a few cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions with a psychotherapist, but she said they didn't help much. Mrs. C has substantial difficulty adhering to medications, even at subtherapeutic doses. She states she is extremely sensitive to all medications. Mrs. C says she develops dizziness, increased anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and other vague reactions whenever she attempts to increase her psychotropics to therapeutic doses. She took sertraline, 10 mg/d, for 4 days, but discontinued it because of unspecified side effects. She then received escitaiopram, 2.5 mg/d, for 10 days, but again stopped it because of vague side effects. She was taking paroxetine, 10 mg/d, for 2 days, but experienced vomiting and discontinued the drug. She tried venlafaxine at a low dose and also discontinued it because of vomiting. Mrs. C stayed on mirtazapine, 22.5 mg/d, for 3 months, but stopped it because of lack of efficacy and she was unwilling to increase the dose. Other unsuccessful trials include citalopram and doxepin. Mrs. C is hesitant to try another medication or increase to therapeutic doses any of the previous medications. How would you treat Mrs. C? a) prescribe a low dose of another antidepressant b) increase the diazepam dose to 10 mg/d c) prescribe lithium or an atypical antipsychotic d) initiate pharmacogenomic testing e) restart CBT The authors' observations Before initiating another treatment, the treatment team considered Mrs. C's pervasive medication intolerance. Her enzymatic activity may be genetically compromised, which could lead to high blood levels of medications and significant side effects when she takes very low doses. Individual variations in response to psychotropics are influenced by genetic factors. (1) Variants in the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes produce enzymes with increased activity, normal activity, reduced activity, or no activity, creating phenotypes of ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, respectively. These genetic variations can affect blood levels of medications that employ these enzymes in their metabolic pathways. (2) Mrs. C could be a poor metabolizer of common CYP450 variant enzymes, which led to her exquisite sensitivity to psychotropics. We felt this was a reasonable hypothesis given her tumultuous 10-month course of psychiatric treatment and multiple failed medication trials. An alternative hypothesis is that Mrs. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Recently there has been enormous progress in couple infertility treatment and diagnostics. Some couples cannot conceive despite the fact that there seems to be no objective somatic or immunologic reasons. In such situations gynaecologists are helpless and couples may be overwhelmed by a sense of defeat and hopelessness. Thus, consulting a psychologist or therapist on how to cope better with the problem may be a good solution. The objective of the following paper is to discuss the dilemmas of couples undergoing infertility treatment, related psychological problems, and to determine the need for psychological and therapeutic support. The study demonstrates numerous infertility causes and concludes that there is no universal method of dealing with them. Very frequently psychological and somatic problems overlap. Psychological causes are often the primary factors, but sometimes they are secondary derivatives of the therapeutic process. A wide scope of factors must be considered to attempt psychological analysis of patients treated for infertility, including the influence of the family and relations within, reaction to the diagnosis and suggested treatment, the influence of religion on the treatment, the evaluation of the relations in the family of procreation, sexual life assessment, the sense of a woman’s self-esteem and self-acceptance. Basing on empirical analysis it was concluded that all women treated for infertility want to create a full family. They have problems in coping with emotional liability during treatment and a sense of fear and failure. Understanding the psychological mechanisms observed in patients treated for infertility might help to diagnose the causes of their problems with facing the new, extremely difficult situation.",

Sexual pain disorders are common and can be so debilitating that they can break relationships or affect a woman's ability to function at work and home. Some women may choose to present with a direct appeal to a healthcare professional for help with a sexual difficulty. However, the most important principle that a clinician must embrace is that sexual pain disorders are a complex interplay between physical and psychological factors. The physical examination is part of the psychotherapeutic consultation in psychosexual medicine. In psychosexual medicine, every patient is unique and the approach to identifying and elucidating the nuances of each patient's story will vary from case to case. Pain with sex may be a secondary presentation, only disclosed when patients have found a person that they trust.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Evidence suggests that sleep is a vital component of physical and health well-being. However, while sleep problems are present in individuals with mental health problems such as depression, it has not been clear whether these conditions are independent or whether they might be causally related. Indeed, if sleep or sleep disorders predispose or modify onset and outcomes of mental health issues, treatment of these factors could be explored as new mental health prevention or treatment options. The aim of this review was to examine in detail the bidirectional relationship between sleep, sleep disorders, and mental and physical health and well-being. It has considered the evidence that sleep architecture disruption, occurring through both quantity, quality, and timing of sleep as well as through the presence of sleep disorders may both influence mental health and well-being as well as be disrupted by both physical and mental health conditions. Also, the review has explored the effects of sleep disruption on mental health and performance through fatigue, mood, and vigilance. The review has considered the bidirectionality between sleep, sleep disorders, and mental health to examine how these may lead to or exacerbate mental health disorders such as affective, anxiety, autism, depressive and schizophrenia disorders but also considers how these conditions can affect sleep. The review highlights that poor sleep or the presence of a sleep disorder can increase the risks from mental health conditions such as suicidality. Furthermore, mental health conditions such as anxiety and worry can cause racing or repetitive thoughts that can keep an individual awake, leading to shortened sleep. It is important that sleep and sleep disorders are considered potential modifiable factors that could improve mental health outcomes. The important interconnect between both physical and mental health and sleep, in patient evaluations, also needs to be considered as these may affect treatment pathways and patient outcomes. Further, more robust and perspective research is required to establish the triad relationship of physical, mental health, and sleep.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

The success and limitations of modern therapy were statistically determined. Many recovered schizophrenics continued to do well even without medication and social care. As a rule, schizophrenics had no endocrine pathology and endocrine patients were not schizophrenic. Neither a broken home in childhood nor an upbringing by a schizophrenic parent resulted in any important association with schizophrenia. However, a disturbed relationship with relatives and loved persons was more frequent in the anamnesis of schizophrenic women than of schizophrenic men. Most schizophrenics who had been schizoid before their psychosis had lived in miserable familial conditions.",

Daytime symptoms include distress about poor nocturnal sleep and impairment in any role function or other aspects of overall well-being.

The situation becomes critical when the fantasies are dramatized in real life with an unsuspecting and usually unwilling man cast in the role of the lover. The woman dwells on the feelings she ascribes to her \"suitor.\" Such delusional thinking, resulting from an ego defect and producing bizarre actions, may be shaped largely by feelings of being unloved or even unloveable; a narcissistic blow is overcome by a grandiose fantasy.

Its criteria are: tolerance, withdrawal effects, lack of control, reductions in other activities, impaired psychological, social or physical functioning. For primary ED, the physical activity is an end in itself; for secondary ED, motivation is extrinsic--to control or alter body mass and shape. Estimates of the prevalence of ED range from 2-3% to 20-30%. Hypotheses of ED development concentrate on beta-endorphin, sympathetic arousal, affect regulation or some psychological explanations (e.g., exercise as distractor).",

Moreover, a patient suffering from cancer loses interest in sex because of psychological stress, and in many cases, cannot enjoy sexual activity with a partner. In addition, changes to the body, such as stoma creation, are factors that render a patient hesitant to initiate or seek sexual contact. Typically, PDE5 inhibitors, intracavernous injection of vasoactive agents, and vacuum contraction devices are used to treat erectile dysfunction. The purpose of treating sexual dysfunction is to recover a satisfying sexual relationship and to rebuild the relationship with a partner after beating cancer.

Apart from the cognitive functions disorder, the clinical picture of dementia consists of non-cognitive symptoms, such as behavioral disorders, psychotic symptoms and affective disorders. They comprise an integral part of the illness and are present in 64-90% of dementia patients. Non-cognitive symptoms of dementia comprise an important part of dementive process, therefore their diagnostics is a step in the way to stating a diagnosis. Some of the non-cognitive symptoms of dementia can be recognised on the basis of the observation of the patient. Among others, these symptoms include anxiety, agitation, wandering around, hoarding, socially unnacepted behaviours, sexual disinhibition, shouting and agressive behaviours. The diagnosis of other disorders require more detailed examination and medical history. While dealing with chronic illnesses, the doctor’s ability to communicate with the patient provides not only the basis for diagnosis and treatment, but most importantly it is one of fundamental forms of therapy. As far as dementia patients are concerned, the diagnosis of non-cognitive behavioural disorders allows the treatment of mental symptoms and the modification of patients’ behaviour. Such methods improve not only the contact with people affected by dementia, but also their ability to function in everyday life, thus reducing their caregivers’ burden.",

Trauma, illnesses, poisons, injuries of any type, and infections of all kinds are examples of physical and chemical variables that can cause stress. There are many different types of emotional reasons of stress and strain. While numerous people associate the term stress with cerebral stress, scientists and croakers use this term to denote any force that impairs the stability and balance of fleshly functions.

Although typically conceptualized as an adult disorder, psychosis often emerges in adolescence, and earlier onset is associated with poorer prognosis. Not surprisingly, longer periods of untreated illness have been linked to poorer clinical, functional, and cognitive outcomes. This indicates a critical need to bolster symptom recognition and early treatment efforts to maximize recovery and minimize the personal and financial sequelae of illness.",

Organic sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) resulting from a decrease of sex hormones in menopause may play an important role as well (14).",

Medically the status of this diagnos is is that of a syndrome or disorder, not a disease, and none of the described behaviours is exclusive to the diagnosis. It also presents as a spectrum disorder, with less and more severe degrees, but it should be noted that the DSM IV classification requires evidence of clinically significant impairment of function.

The chief symptoms are those of anxiety and its physical concomitants in the absence of other illness and independent of specific situations; they include breathing and swallowing difficulties, palpitations, dizziness, irritability, and faintness. Depression, phobias, and obsessions are common complications. The syndrome occurs in young adults of both sexes and its course may be acute or chronic. Acute forms may present in epidemics which are culture bound, e.g., Koro and epidemic hysteria. Chronic forms can fluctuate and persist for many years without other physical or psychiatric syndromes appearing. Between attacks the patient feels fairly well. Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 5 per cent of the normal population and 6 to 27 per cent of psychiatric outpatients.

The commonest symptoms both in men and women were sleep disturbances, fatiguability, loss of interest, depressed mood, loss of activity, pains, pessimism and sense of uselessness. In addition, worry was a common symptom in women. Hallucina tions and other delusions than those about unforgivable behaviour were very uncom mon. Loss of libido did not strongly indicate occurrence of depression, and in persons aged 70 years or over it could not be included in symptoms of depression. Sex dif ferences in the commonest symptoms of depression were evident: worry, crying spells, helplessness, loneliness, suicidal ideas and pains were more common in depressed women than in depressed men. Some age differences in symptoms were also found both in men and in women. Sad expression was a common sign of depression in both sexes. In addition, slow movements, scarcity of gestures and slow speech were quite common signs in depressed men and stooping posture was quite common in depressed women.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

It seems that marked impairment in ADHD children social functioning (conduct disorders, aggressivity, destructive behavior) is a significant predictor of adult social disability (substance use disorders, antisocial personality and even criminality). Adult ADHD seems to be a reality, but much less frequent than in youths. Impulsivity, attention disorder, and emotional status are the main characters of the syndrome. We have no data leading to the responsibility of psychostimulant treatment in substance use disorders in teenage or adulthood. Implications of early versus late onset of ADHD symptoms are not clear.

      "abstract": "Ten years research into the physical and psychosocial consequences of severe brain damage in adults has revealed substantial information about the process of recovery. The main features are evidence that the greater part of physical and mental recovery occurs within six months of injury and that in most cases the mental consequences of injury outweigh the physical ones and place the greater burden upon the injured person's relatives. Impairment of memory is the most common cognitive disorder and alterations in personality often occur also and are the most taxing of the mental deficits for all concerned. The process of recovery has three stages, in the first the patient is unconscious, in the second he or she regains full consciousness signified by the end of the period of post traumatic amnesia and continues to show evidence of rapid improvement in basic physical and mental functions. The rate of recovery shows within six months of injury in most cases and this represents the end of the second stage. In the third stage, which may last for many months, both the patient and his or her relatives adapt to the residual disabilities of the former. Methods of managing the three stages should include physical, psychological and social techniques and the way in which they may be linked to the patients' differing physical and psychosocial needs during the three stages of recovery are briefly discussed.",

      "title": "Chronic Psychosis in Dual Disorder Heroin Use Disorder Patients",
      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder, manic or depressive episodes and mixed states are frequently marked by psychotic symptoms. Moreover, psychosis may occur after substance use disorder, often intervening with the effect of making the clinical picture indistinguishable from that of a primary psychosis. Cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, alcohol and poly-use most commonly develop psychosis induced by the non-medical use of substances. Among substance use disorder users, it has not yet been ascertained whether opioids exert a psychotic effect. Still, some authors have supported the view that opioids have antidepressant, antipanic and antipsychotic effects. It has also been hypothesized that affective disorders, coupled with genetic disposition rather than affective disturbance or psychosis, result in bipolar psychosis or schizoaffective disorder, respectively. In the history of chronic psychotics, heroin use is relatively infrequent. Chronic use of psychotogenic substances and autonomous chronicity of psychotic symptoms may root in a bipolar substrate. Substance use among people with schizophrenia cannot always be justified in terms of dysphoria. Still, the number of depressive symptoms can significantly influence the risk rate for alcohol, cannabinoid use or poly-use. Dual disorder psychotic heroin-addicted patients usually enter treatment with more severe psychopathological aspects and a shorter, less severe addiction history than their non-psychotic peers suggesting that these patients are likely to benefit from opioid medication. These data indirectly confirm the antipsychotic effects of opioids and Khantzian's self-medication hypothesis. For further confirmation, patients affected by chronic psychosis and anxiety disorders tend to progress from a psychiatric disorder to a substance use disorder. In contrast, patients with mood disorders are initially affected by drug addiction. As far as dual disorder is concerned, it is advisable to employ agents that do not heavily affect dopamine metabolism in an inhibitory way since the worsening of use hampers the effectiveness upon psychotic symptoms. On the other hand, when the tie with substances is more robust, their use may amplify as a direct consequence of dopamine antagonism, as a compensatory mechanism effective throughout the reward pathway. Novel antipsychotics seem to permit equivalent effectiveness on psychotic symptoms without promoting drug use, at least to the same extent, and might have anticraving properties.",

      "title": "The Causes of Underdiagnosing Akathisia",
      "abstract": "This article reviews what causes clinicians to overlook or underdiagnose akathisia. The causes are considered to be related to both the patient's symptoms and the clinician's attitude toward akathisia. The patient factors include mild severity of akathisia, lack of apparent motor restlessness, no voluntary expression of inner restlessness, no clear communication of inner restlessness, restlessness in body parts other than the legs, atypical expressions of inner restlessness, other prominent psychic symptoms, and absence of other extrapyramidal signs. The clinician factors include emphasis on objective restlessness, failure to consider akathisia during antipsychotic therapy, failure to fully implement antiakathisia treatments in ambiguous cases, and strict adherence to research diagnostic criteria. Akathisia is likely to be overlooked or underdiagnosed when both patient and clinician factors are present. Currently, there may be two major problems with underdiagnosis: (1) symptoms that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for akathisia are overlooked, and (2) conditions that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria but can still benefit from antiakathisia measures are underdiagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Objective. This article reviews the potential physical and psychological consequences of chronic pain and the importance of implementing effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate the harms associated with inadequate treatment. Results. A review of recent literature examining the neurobiology and pathophysiology of chronic pain reveals that this highly prevalent condition negatively impacts multiple aspects of patient health, including sleep, cognitive processes and brain function, mood/mental health, cardiovascular health, sexual function, and overall quality of life. Furthermore, chronic pain has the capacity to become increasingly complex in its pathophysiology, and thus potentially more difficult to treat over time. The various health complications related to chronic pain can also incur significant economic consequences for patients. Conclusions. Like other chronic conditions, it is important that chronic pain is managed with the objective of minimizing or avoiding its associated long-term sequelae. In line with this approach, early and effective multimodal treatment strategies, including analgesic therapy that controls pain intensity, are essential to improving outcomes and returning patients to normal levels of function.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CSF1R-related adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is characterized by executive dysfunction, memory decline, personality changes, motor impairments, and seizures. A frontal lobe syndrome (e.g., loss of judgment, lack of social inhibitors, lack of insight, and motor persistence) usually appears early in the disease course. The mean age of onset is usually in the fourth decade. Affected individuals eventually become bedridden with spasticity and rigidity. The disease course ranges from two to 30 or more years (mean: 8 years). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is suspected in individuals with characteristic clinical and brain MRI findings and is confirmed by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CSF1R. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive management includes: attention to general care and nutritional requirements; antiepileptic drugs for seizures; and antibiotic treatment for general and recurrent infections. Prevention of secondary complications: Information about and support systems for the social problems and suicidal tendencies often associated with disease progression. Surveillance: Periodic brain MRI and clinical evaluation to monitor disease progression. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Use of first-generation neuroleptics due to increased seizure risk and risk of additional parkinsonian signs; medications used to treat multiple sclerosis as they are of no benefit and have major side effects. Genetic counseling CSF1R-related ALSP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with CSF1R-related ALSP usually have an affected parent; de novo mutation can occur. Each child of an individual with CSF1R-related ALSP has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant in a family is known.",

      "title": "Dimensionality and the category of major depressive episode",
      "abstract": "Major depressive episode (MDE) is a chronic disease typified by episodes that remit and recur. It is a major contributor to the burden of disease. The diagnosis of a disorder is an expert opinion that the disorder is present. The nine symptoms of MDE exist on dimensions of greater or lesser intensity, persistence over time, change in usual state, distress and impairment. It is the clinician's task to judge whether the elicited symptoms warrant the diagnosis. The surprise is that trained clinicians can do this reliably and that diagnostic interviews and questionnaires can emulate this process. The distribution of symptoms in community surveys is exponential, with no obvious discontinuity at the diagnostic threshold. Taxometric and primary care studies confirm this. The number of symptoms predicts severity, comorbidity, family history, disability, help seeking and treatment recommendations. The latent structure of mental disorders places MDE in the distress misery cluster. Measures of well-being, distress, disability and neuroticism correlate with the number of symptoms but the relation is not perfect. The Patient Health Questionnaire is derived from the diagnostic criteria and does not suffer this limitation. The introduction of measures like this would acknowledge dimensionality, would facilitate recognition, guide treatment, and be acceptable to consumers, providers and funders.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

Because patients with these disorders are commonly referred to the consultation-liaison service, it is important for hospital-based mental health professionals to understand these illnesses. Identifying and differentiating between these diagnoses requires an understanding of several factors, including the patient's medical history, circumstances that may be driving behavior, and careful evaluation of the patient's awareness of these factors. Such factors are also essential in directing treatment, which tends to be time intensive and prolonged.

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

Recent research has targeted either the late pre-onset or early post-onset phases of schizophrenia.

Subtle pre-illness clinical, psychosocial and cognitive deficits have been reported for many years. But it is only in the past decade that systematic, reliable identification of \"prodromal\" individuals has become possible, based on the presence of subthreshold psychotic symptoms and/or a family history of schizophrenia with signs of functional deterioration.

Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that this non-paraphilic condition consists of \"excessive\" sexual behaviors and disorders accompanied by personal distress and social and medical morbidity. Hypersexual disorder is conceptualized as primarily a non-paraphilic sexual desire disorder with impulsivity. Pathophysiological perspectives include dysregulation of sexual arousal and desire, sexual impulsivity, sexual addiction, and sexual compulsivity. The nucleus accumbens, situated within the ventral striatum, mediates the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, and food as well as music. Indeed, it is believed that this structure mandates behaviors elicited by incentive stimuli. These behaviors include natural rewards like feeding, drinking, sexual behavior, and exploratory locomotion. An essential rule of positive reinforcement is that motor responses will increase in magnitude and vigor if followed by a rewarding event. Here, we are hypothesizing that there is a common mechanism of action (MOA) for the powerful effects drugs, music, food, and sex have on human motivation. The human drive for the three necessary motivational behaviors \"hunger, thirst, and sex\" may all have common molecular genetic antecedents that, if impaired, lead to aberrant behaviors. We hypothesize that based on a plethora of scientific support hypersexual activity is indeed like drugs, food, and music that activate brain mesolimbic reward circuitry. Moreover, dopaminergic gene and possibly other candidate neurotransmitter-related gene polymorphisms affect both hedonic and anhedonic behavioral outcomes. There is little known about both the genetics and epigenetics of hypersexuality in the current literature. However, we anticipate that future studies based on assessments with clinical instruments combined with genotyping of sex addicts will provide evidence for specific clustering of sexual typologies with polymorphic associations. The authors are also encouraging both clinical and academic scientists to embark on research using neuroimaging tools to examine natural dopaminergic agonistic agents targeting specific gene polymorphisms to \"normalize\" hyper- or hyposexual response.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

      "abstract": "Every physician faces the problem of dealing with mental symptoms in his patients. Mental symptoms are of very frequent occurrence. They may arise in the course of any disease process. Not infrequently cases appear in which a morbid mental state constitutes the essential etiologic soil out of which the somatic, or bodily, symptoms arise. On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin. For example, the clinician makes use of the technical researches of the specialist in cardiorenal disorders, or of the biochemist in diabetes, or of the endocrinologist in the use of complicated ductless gland therapy.

Vecina istraživaca danas definira depresivnost u terminima kontinuuma od normalne, povremene i prolazne žalosti do duboke depresije koja traje ili se stalno ponovo vraca. Danas se procjenjuje da oko 10-15% djece u opcoj populaciji ima znacajno izražene simptome depresije. Psihosomatski simptomi predstavljaju sve one tjelesne simptome koji se javljaju pod utjecajem emocionalnih cimbenika, a ukljucuju jedan organski sustav, obicno pod kontrolom autonomnog živcanog sustava. Simptomi se mogu javiti u rasponu od jednog ili vise simptoma slabijeg intenziteta pa sve do veceg broja vrlo intenzivnih simptoma koji djetetu ometaju svakodnevno funkcioniranje. Razliciti tjelesni simptomi psihogene etiologije koji se javljaju u djetinjstvu i adolescenciji dio su razlicitih klinickih slika (pa tako i depresije), a najcesce se opisuju u kategoriji razlicitih psihosomatskih i somatoformnih poremecaja (APA, 1996). U radu su prikazani rezultati istraživanja koje je provedeno s ciljem utvrđivanja specificnih aspekata depresivnosti koji su povezani s pojavom psihosomatskih simptoma u djece i adolescenata. Istraživanje je provedeno na uzorku od 315 ucenika (158 djevojcica i 157 djecaka) od 5. do 8. razreda osnovne skole. U istraživanju su primijenjene dvije skale: Skala depresivnosti za djecu i adolescente SDD (Vulic-Prtoric, 2003) i Upitnik psihosomatskih simptoma za djecu i adolescente PSS (Vulic-Prtoric, 2005). Rezultati provedenog istraživanja pokazuju da ispitanici koji postižu klinicki znacajno izražene simptome depresivnosti imaju i veci broj psihosomatskih simptoma (osobito pseudoneuroloskih, gastrointestinalnih, kardiovaskularnih) te da u vecoj mjeri doživljavaju glavobolje, umor i razlicite oblike bolova. Nadalje, utvrđene su spolne razlike kako u doživljavanju simptoma depresivnosti tako i psihosomatskih simptoma: u usporedbi s djecacima, djevojcice imaju znacajno veci broj simptoma. Zakljucak: Dobiveni rezultati potvrđuju teorijske postavke u razvojnoj psihopatologiji o dvosmjernoj povezanosti depresivnih i psihosomatskih simptoma: depresivnosti kao snažnom rizicnom cimbeniku u razvoju psihosomatskih reakcija, ali i kao posljedici dugotrajnijeg doživljavanja tjelesnih tegoba. Razmotrene su i prakticne implikacije dobivenih rezultata, posebice u planiranju tretmana djece sklone somatizaciji, te depresivne djece i adolescenata.",

DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by intense fatigue, with duration of over six months and associated to other related symptoms. The latter include asthenia and easily induced tiredness that is not recovered after a night's sleep. The fatigue becomes so severe that it forces a 50% reduction in daily activities. Given its unknown aetiology, different hypotheses have been considered to explain the origin of the condition (from immunological disorders to the presence of post-traumatic oxidative stress), although there are no conclusive diagnostic tests. Diagnosis is established through the exclusion of other diseases causing fatigue. This syndrome is rare in childhood and adolescence, although the fatigue symptom per se is quite common in paediatric patients. Currently, no curative treatment exists for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. The therapeutic approach to this syndrome requires a combination of different therapeutic modalities. The specific characteristics of the symptomatology of patients with chronic fatigue require a rapid adaptation of the educational, healthcare and social systems to prevent the problems derived from current systems. Such patients require multidisciplinary management due to the multiple and different issues affecting them. This document was realized by one of the Interdisciplinary Work Groups from the Institute for Rare Diseases, and its aim is to point out the main social and care needs for people affected with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. For this, it includes not only the view of representatives for different scientific societies, but also the patient associations view, because they know the true history of their social and sanitary needs. In an interdisciplinary approach, this work also reviews the principal scientific, medical, socio-sanitary and psychological aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.",
